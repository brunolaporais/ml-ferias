1197,Egg drop soup at ninety-nine places out of one hundred will be flavorless bland and boring usually requiring the addition of soy sauce in a last ditch effort to salvage some level of flavor out of it Not hereJade Palace IS that one in one hundred place A restaurant where the egg drop soup is such a brightly colored yellow It will remind you of the scene in Pulp Fiction where Samuel L Jackson opens the briefcase and whatever was in it presumably gold cast a golden hue onto his face Its that brightAnd the flavor Incomparable Rich with depth and flavor A rarity for egg drop The egg drop soup however was merely foreplay as compared to my entree Egg Foo YungMost EFY's are served patty-shaped or as a thin layer covering the plate Not here Here your EFY expectations will be overly exceeded when as you see it being delivered you're unable to recognize it as an EFY Mountainous it looks like a beautifully golden browned souffl√© hot out of the oven You can't wait to sample it It's then you discover how its uncanny resemblance to a perky D-cup is the clever result of not one but several layers of spongy EFY goodness And to augment this delight (as if a D-cup would ever need augmentation) there's a gravy boat filled to its gunwales with a rich and flavorful brown sauce tying the dish together in a tightly woven knot A pleasant young server Egg Drop soup with a flavor so extraordinarily rare I can still taste it And a gigantic EFY mound that was definitely 'more than a mouthful' That's what i call the ultimate Chinese experience PSMy wife had the Chicken Chow Mein which I didn't sample until 3 o'clock this morning It was cold gelatinous and served in a box which in no way resembled a big golden breast A disappointment by any uber-male hetero / lesbianic account to say the least.

1949,Wonderful country store Christmas time was nice with unique ornaments and decorations I purchased a table here not too long ago good quality and i constantly receive compliments on the piece.
2080,"Carolina's has the best tortillas in town hands downI'm going to pretend like I didn't read some of the reviews about the place being in the ""ghetto"" and not wanting to be there after dark etc My office is just across the street and while I will admit that the neighborhood is different than the one I live in I've never felt nervous about being there Most of the residents of the neighborhood whom I have met and worked with are hardworking individuals just trying to make ends meet Ok that's the end of my soapbox tirade Moving on we eat at Carolina's quite often since there aren't a whole lot of other options within walking distance and I'll be damned if I give up my covered parking space in the summer I actually like the ""cafeteria"" type style of the place and will occasionally eat there instead of ordering food to go I love the Machaca burritos and the breakfast burritos are to die for (and at $3 a pop you can't beat it) Bottom line I highly recommend checking out Carolina's for some good Mexican food."
660,I can also vouch for this incredible veterinarian office they saved the life of my cat and my dog who had parvo  The price to service ratio is incredible  Not sure if Dr Jimmy Alexander is still there but he was the best  most comforting veterinarian  I would never take my pets anywhere else.
1930,The whole experience was perfect Was here last Sunday morning for brunch and was so thrilled with the choice in location for our get together The staff was great Our server was very friendly and patient with our party of 15 The server decided to split up the order which was a fantastic idea The food for the other side came out right after she had even finished taking our order Love when food is quick but not at the burden of the quality of food This was not at all the case The restaurant was pretty empty but we did not have to wait long for our food Typically it's a waiting game when you have a large group I ordered the breakfast panini which was delicious I've actually been craving it ever since I was there The panini had egg mozzarella tomato and spinach on it The bread was fresh and the potato wedges were to die for I was told to try their pesto sauce and fell in love Dipping my sandwich was exactly what I needed The mimosas were tasty Wished that the Bellini would have been on special also but that wasn't a problem Mimosas did the job They had a live band playing at brunch He was very talented and the level of sound was not too loud for us girls to chat I will be coming back to this restaurant because there are so many delicious looking options or maybe I'm just ready for another mimosa.
2855,Loving this little spot  The cooks are friendly the filet kabob and basmati rice are great and the prices are reasonable  I hesitate to give 5 stars to a place with ambiance like a fast food type restaraunt but this place is exactly what you expect of it  Clean quick and remarkably tasty.
2805,"I have been going to Candy for 10 years and she is amazing She listens to the changes that I want to make to my ""usual"" and is so great Whenever my friends got a botched highlighting job or haircut they always go back to Candy to fix itVita Bella is clean & beautifully decorated with a warm atmosphere It is bizarre how many people I know that go to Vita Bella My sister-in-law goes to Lisa Stinelli to get her nails done and they always look fantastic Everyone I've come in contact with is so talented at this salon."
4638,"Had a bad experience with Gina who does permanent cosmetics there  Bought a Groupon  She gave me a dark left eye and a barely there right eye for upper and lower eyeliner  She was more focused on selling Mary Kay products then doing a good job with the permanent cosmetics  On her ""follow up"" calls to me to see how my eyeliner was she continued to try to sell Mary Kay  When I told her about my uneven eyes she said she would fix that all up on our follow up appointment for $50 - then she blew off that appointment  I arrived there to a locked door  Even though she has nothing to do with their laser work I would not go back there even though I was very interested in having some done  Too many bad vibes."
4064,My wife wanted to go there after church because it was close to the house The service as well as the food was mediocre at best So many better places  to go in Surprise Rio Mirage Cafe on Litchfield is my Favorite.
487,"We love this venue  Its a little treasure in Cave Creek  Don't let the ""Coffeehouse"" sign fool you  They have a large selection of beer and wine  The patio is amazing too."
4156,I would not use this company again  Do they clean well YES  But make sure you get your estimate in writing  I was quoted a price then charged 3 times more than quoted  I spoke with the owner to find out what was going on and he told me I was never quoted what I said I washe was calling me a liar  After a 5 minute conversation he would not come to any agreement  This is a dishonest company  There are so many other businesses you could usedont use this one.
1979,Love the small town and family owned feel of this place The staff was sweet attentive and prompt even on Mother' day.
678,How does one measure a little donut shop As far as I'm concerned one measures it by the friendliness of the staff and the availability of fresh delicious donutsThe family that opened this donut shop is amazingly friendly I've been in there at traditional times (Saturday or Sunday morning) but also odd times like Friday night They always have an incredible array of fresh donuts that are way better than the competition in my view Krispy Kreme can go home.
4173,This government office gets an F for being handicap accessible The parking does not provide enough van spaces Several able-bodied people were parking in the available spots with no placard The ramp was too steep and the door had no way to open automatically Still waiting in the initial check-in line so perhaps the verdict on the rest of their services will be different.
2765,Well I have lived here for almost 3 years now and I had just visited Del Sol in both Jamaica and Cozumel on a recent cruise just 3 weeks agoso Imagine my shock when I discovered there was a Del Sol right here in Old Town Scottsdale It was very exciting because it was Small business Saturday on November 24th of this year and we were looking to use our AMEX to earn a 25 dollar credit on a 25 dollar purchase So after searching the AMEX site to see if Del Sol was on the list of participating small business' BEHOLD it was and I was off to shop at the world's only store with clothing that changes color when exposed to sunlight That's right if you have not heard of this store or this awesome technology you need to pay a visit to this locale ASAP Del Sol is known all over the world for being the ONLY store with clothing that has designs on them that when exposed to sunlight they immediately change color and the colors are stunning let me tell you Apparently this technology was developed by the Military and Del Sol managed to get a contract to be the ONLY retailer to use and sell this kind of productI bought a muscle shirt and my wife a couple of hair clips on the day we visited this locale The staff was extremely nice and professionalthere are machines in the store that generate sunlight so you can see what colors your items will turn into before you even buy them Everythingand I do mean everythingfrom shirtsskirtstopbottomsjewelrytrinketskey chainsblousesetcchange colorit is extremely awesome When I was in Jamaica I bought some short pants/swimming trunks along with some shirts I have to tell you the trunks were awesome because not only do they change color when your swimming in themthey dry in about 15 minutes and you can walk around in them all day without changing Now be advised things here are not cheapbut they are not expensive eithermake sure you look for the good dealsevery store is a little different I can guarantee one thing it will be the coolest item you will buy if your on vacation BAR NONE When you return home and show it off everyone will want to know where you got itbe sure to tell the Del Sol and as usual Eat Drink and be Merry my Friends.
4220,"HelloAnd I hope this review does exactly what I intend for it to do Get the principals of this joke for a restaurant  who ever they are  to read it and wake up Obviously they must be eating the dog food they have been fed by others who rave about this placeLet's start at the beginning went for lunch walked in saw people at tables so waited to see if an employee would be directing us NOPE nothing of the sorts walked up to an outdoor menu over a entrance again what do I do next People inside look at you but don't ask to help you We had our dog with us so I asked my girlfriend to go in and see what she can find out She walked to the counter and again no one would help Can I order Then a person replied and pointed ""you start down there"" Okay great were getting somewhere She placed an order for a salad (pre-made crushed into a small container) a chicken salad sandwich and a lemonade she came out and handed me the salad and drinks and said ' let's find a table I have to go over to another area to wait for the sandwich""  I sat down at a table with our dog outdoors next to  32nd street (This is a farm) and she went to get the sandwich  OH the daymare has just started After about 20 minutes she sent me a text and said"" I haven't left you still waiting"" This is Chicken Salad People slap it on the bread add some lettuce and tomatoes and it's ready to go Here's where it gets really good several people who arrived after us are getting their food from the mystery window by the red umbrella My girlfriend has now been standing there 30 minutes waiting she taps on the window and asks "" is there a problem with the chicken salad""  ""I'll check""  the window closes and 10 minutes later the window opens revealing the sandwich  Now I would say this is possibly a one off scenario except right before she received our sandwich another person who had been waiting said he was on 37 minutes and then another person came up while she was receiving her sandwich and said ""how long does it take to get a tuna sandwich"" he had been waiting 30 minutesWe eat what I would say is ordinary fresh food nothing to write home about and because I found the concept of standing and waiting 40 minutes to get an average sandwich so ridiculous I stopped back in to express myself and politely said  ""This is our first time here and your service was awful and we will never return""Their response exactly like the whole experience started NOTHINGAnd although we typically know what items cost before we eat anywhere so initially the price seemed okay but this place is definitely OVERPRICED."
1481,I'm a junior at ASU and drove past this place on university for THREE years until I finally went inthat was a mistake  Now I go there whenever I can   Though while on the outside it looks like just a chain bagel place its way more than that  Chompies sandwiches taste just like (to me) some of the best Jewish delis Ive been to in NYChonestly its that good     My faves:         **Jewish Sliders-What Chompies is best known for (as well as featured on Man VS Food for) a very hearty combo of 3 cholla rolls filled brisket mini potato pancakes & Jack cheese and a side of gravy THE BEST Sandwich I have had in Arizona hands down          **The Brooklyner Triple Decker-(pastrami corned beef and braised brisket on double baked Jewish rye)  It has it all the only thing I do to it is ask the server to add coleslaw too it which puts it over the top.
1418,This place has the best sushi in Phoenix   Make sure you bring your own saki beer or wine though.
3369,Dislike.
1557,Nice staff Great sandwiches Great coffee and drinks Free wifi and great hours 6am to 9pm or 11pm (Fri & Sat) Nice local feel.
2380,The Western is a fun new spot located on 5th Ave just west of Goldwater Live country bands a dance floor dim lights good food and cheap drinks made for an interesting evening I have a feeling that The Western will be with us for awhile Live music every Wednesday thru Sunday with NO COVER.
3126,If you advertise Price Matching you should HONOR itI came in on December 22 to purchasee two items that happend to be cheaper at BevMo by $2 each  Not that big of a deal but the manager refused to honor the price match until he confirmed on his computer that the price was valid in Arizona  Seriously showing him on my phone the live website was not good enough  What a waste of my time and everyone behind me in line  I paid the full price to avoid delay but I will not shope here again and I will continue to shop at BevMo  BevMo has MUCH better customer service and honor their price matching policyAdditionally they were out of stock of one of the items that I was looking for  Which only added to my frustrations.
4014,"I went there with my friend who really likes it  I ordered  an $850 Reuben that had three wafer-thin slices of corned beef wadded into a ball in the middle to provide the illusion that there was some beef on the sandwich  I pointed this out to my not-so-friendly server when she queried my satisfaction with the meal  She said in a snotty put-upon voice ""Well we weight the meat for every sandwich  Every sandwich gets four ounces""  It was clear this one was way under and when I pointed this out she said ""do you want more meat""  I asked if I was going to be charged - she said ""Yes""  I said no thanks and now my mission is to dissuade anyone who cares from ever going to this place."
4669,Jesus what a dive  Not necessarily a bad thing but just dont expect anything more Greg Louganis stylee Cheap drinks always welcomeEverything on the menu is fried bar food to be expectedWalking through the smoking section just to get in trashyTrivia on Friday while the playoffs were on wtf  I thought this was a sports bar  They mute a playoff game to do trivia   Why the hell would anyone go here if Half Moon and Teakwoods are nearby  Screw this joint  I'll gladly pay a few bucks more for a better bar with better TVs  Weak Sauce.
3416,"DO NOT EAT HEREThe food here is the worst Chinese food we have ever tasted My girlfriend and I took one bite of our dinner and left Garbage junk and complete trash The reviewer who said he would ""Stick his wiener in a meat grinder"" was not exaggerating We should have heeded his warning."
282,Pita Jungle in Gilbert has been our go-to lunch spot in the area for the last couple of years It's always packed whenever we go and the laidback hipster servers are always friendly on point and attentive in their own ways Their menu has a wide range of mediterranean and some middle eastern healthy dishes and I don't think we've ever had something we don't like Today we had the mahi mahi with pita chips and some type of healthy veggie-pizza on a flat bread () Both were excellent We'll continue to go as long as it keeps rockin I'm surprised there are only a few locations in the valley.
1853,"I had a terrible experience with Sterling Auto Body in Peoria After I was involved in a front end collision I had my vehicle towed to Sterling at the recommendation of my insurance company I was told that because they were a direct repair network shop the tow would be free  They ended up billing my insurance company $80 for the tow  After about three weeks I got a call that my car was done  As I drove it home I realized how dangerous the car was to drive The brakes were not adjusted properly after the car was put back together If someone test drove the car before they called me they would have realized how dangerous the car was to drive I immediately took the car back The second time I picked my car up I noticed that the bumper was not lined up correctly and it had a rattle when I drove  The bumper was fixed but I was told the rattle was normal because my car was ""older"" (2007 with less than 25K miles) After I picked up my vehicle the third time I took it to Firestone and explained that I had a rattle under the hood  They immediately noticed that a couple of aluminum plates on the fire wall were overlapping and fixed it for free on the spot  I had also pointed out to Sterling that the engine had a shake it did not have before the accident  Again I was told this was normal and it would probably smooth out over time  I took the car to my mechanic who discovered a hairline crack in a motor mount After several weeks of going back and forth with Sterling my insurance company and my mechanic the car is now fixed and running greatDealing with Sterling was extremely frustrating and I would not recommend them to anyone I care about  They dismissed my concerns as being too critical  I had to take my vehicle to two other shops in order to get my vehicle running the way it should have the first time I picked it up from Sterling."
3502,Don't stay here The rooms are old the door was falling off the hinges light fixtures chipped the bathroom calling leaked right over the toilet there are cigarette butts all over the ground the majority of the staff could careless you are a paying guest The wifi occasionally worked It was a very uncomfortable experience.
2521,"Stayed here with my wife when business brought me to Phoenix and had a great time Our room was a nice suite a la the Embassy Suites brand and the price was reasonable The casitas are much bigger and also a good deal price-wise We just didn't need that much space We enjoyed the lazy river the water slide the wading pool with a waterfall and the hot tub It's great in the summertime as well as the shoulder seasonsNote that this hotel is very kids-oriented At peak times there can be crowds of boisterous adolescents in the pool areas many of them with no adult supervision The hotel is also ""pet friendly"" a plus for some and a minus for others."
2816,I had an akashic reading with Josefa and it was seriously the most heart-opening thing I've ever experienced It gave me an understanding of myself on a soul level and helped me piece things together in my life that I've always wondered about Finding out what my life lessons are and what my natural skill set is helps me in my business too Josefa gave me easy action steps to do that helped me get the most out of our session She records the reading and I just listened to it again the other day and I got clear on even more things.
3948,"I have never in my life had such horrible customer service I ate here tonight with my husband and two kids When we got our order we noticed that we were missing a burrito My husband approached the counter and kindly mentioned to them what we were missing and the woman behind the counter Cynthia was totally rude and snapped at my husband and argued that she put it on our tray My husband explained that he did not see it and she rudely said that she would make us another one A few minutes later she storms to our table and slams down our tray with the missing burrito and points at another burrito on our tray and yells ""See there it is right there"" She then stormed off and glared at us and gave us a dirty look My husband and I were so upset we left without finishing our meal and went home and called the customer service number and left a message explaining what had happened I have never ever had to call a customer service number to complain Ever I will never go back to this location again and ""Cynthia"" needs a new job."
2430,Best bagels in scottsdale Excellent coffeefamily owned Great service Highly recommended.
4063,"I went in to this location with my three year old tonight to return a warped record that I had bought earlier in the day at the Camelback location I viewed their return policy on the website before going to make the return The website states that a return/exchange can be made at any location I went up to the counter to make my return and there was a bearded guy behind the counter I told him that I needed to return the record and he gave me a dirty look and asked ""where did you buy this"" with an attitude I told him at Zia and he asked which one I told him where and he stuck the record out and said again with an attitude ""well then you need to bring it there""  I asked why considering that the website stated that returns could be made at any location He said that because the store had recently changed into an outlet that they couldn't take it I didn't even know that it had become an outlet He was still giving me attitude so I asked him why he was giving me this attitude Words were said back and forth between us until the store manager intervened and got in between us like he was trying to break up a fight He took the record from the employee and was holding it Instead of being professional and telling the guy behind the counter to go cool off he proceeded to tell me that I could go to a different store that they had just opened I told him that I couldn't make it there right then and how this was ridiculous  I then noticed the guy behind the counter was staring daggers at me so I asked him why he was still acting like this He then started to behave in a manner that I can only compare to a high schooler that wanted to fight He and the manager both said I ""better do this and better do that""  The guy behind the counter and manager said something to the effect of ""taking this outside"" I then said to them ""what the f are you going to do""  I was told that they were going to call the cops on me and I told them to do it They did not There was profanity going back and forth between us and the guy behind the counter said something about how I was acting in front of my daughter Why is that his business If anything I'm showing her how to deal with an insignificant asshole who works at a record store and probably will for the rest of his life  At this point another employee who had nothing to do with any of this came over and started chiming in as well I was then trying to leave  because I had had enough and attempted to get my record from the manager who wouldn't let go of it I tried taking it from him three times before I told him to give me my f'n record Then the third guy who came over told me that I wasn't allowed back Really Did you really think I was going back to your shitty record store I'll do you one better I won't shop at any of Zia's stores anymore Maybe they should think about hiring competent workers and managers and not hipsters."
1912,How the hell can this place be sitting on top of a Pei Wei and a StarbucksIt's a hip urban lounge Spacious lots of comfy seating including a wall hugging couch seat thingymabob Kind of a modern take on a 70's era lounge without the ferns but with the mood lighting They mix a damn good drink - especially their Margaritas which are made with a home made mix not the neon green shit from a bottle The music is aways downtempo The mood is chill I've only gone with friends so far but could see it making a good stop on a date It's def the kind of place where you want to BYOC (bring your own company) because there isn't much of a social atmosphere But for a fun classy place to go with friends it's awesome Once you're feeling sauced up head down the way to Bikini Lounge and cause some ruckus.
4644,07/09/2008  Just went there last week for the first and last time  I read the good reviews so I was expecting much more  I am a first generation American both my parents were German and came over in their 20's  I lived there for a few years have eaten German food all my life and have been to many German restaurants in many different states over the years  I really wanted to like this place as there are not many German establishments around here but this place was terrible  We were the only people in the place at 2pm and still had horrible service    We were ignored much of the time and then when the waitress did come she would forget things we had asked her for  The waitress didn't understand German as in the German MENU options so I ordered from the menu using the English translations and she was still confused I had to POINT at the options  YES there really is CUCUMBER salad on the menu  The bread was stale the schnitzel was hard there was a hair in my cucumber salad and my potato pancakes were just disgusting  They also gave me fries instead of the usual sides  I am guessing that they just reheated leftovers from the dinner the night before because that is exactly what it tasted like  Plus I actually got charged the wrong prices - like lunch salad was 350 but showed up on my bill as 500 etc  I was too frustrated to even bring it up and just left disappointed  Waste of time and money I will not return  Maybe at dinner time things are better but DO NOT EVEN TRY THE LUNCH  YuckOh and the website is outdated- wrong prices and discontinued menu items.
2301,The owner has changed hands & this place isn't what it used to be  If you want up to date paper & quality productgo to Scrap Happy OR Crop Girls.
4844,This is a late night drive-thru liquor store rebranded to appear upscale The clientele seems to consist of people on their way to a party alcoholics and homeless people The owners are rude and unfriendly The place reeks and is a large source of nuisance and pollution to the surrounding neighborhood Lots of smash & grab crime on the surrounding street Overpriced goods Definitely NOT the place to go if you are actually looking for a decent selection of fine wines.
4812,Disgusting Grilled Fish taco looked like cat food and didn't taste any better  Took 2 bites and threw away.
2599,The place has the best Riesling in the world Went here on sat night and had the spinach dip ( so good) and for dinner we had Thai steak salad $20 (amazing) and the Hawaiian rib eye $34 (yummy) and for desert we had the key lime pie which was great but the ice cream dessert was not good at all over all the food was amazing but the price was a little high.
3278,I received a ring for Christmas that needed to be sized Went into this location to drop it off A salesperson by the name of Tim was at the counter I told him what I needed and he was less than thrilled to help me I had to ask to see a ring sizer I had to ask him about how long it would take He didnt offer up any info at all It was like pulling teeth I realize this wasnt a new sale and he wasnt making any money off of me BUT the ring was bought at Kay and he should have been more willing to help I usually shop at a different jewelry store and after this experience I would never step foot into another Kay jewelry store I will give Helzberg my money instead.
3731,"Worst hotel ever for this ""level"" Upon check in the elevator door wouldn't close after 4 attempts we used the stairs We get to our room and the key doesn't work The front desk gave us the wrong room key It actually opened another room Lucky we aren't thieves"" The TV did NOT work so we went without There is nothing like crud in the corners of the bathroom floor from a lazy mop job over many weeks (obviously) for that kind of build up Gross overall If you are looking for somewhere within walking distance to Chase Field we did not find it threatening to walk in that area Late at night after a game there are a lot of people and vehicles around Those reasons are why it seemed OK for the area I must say however in 104 degrees it is a lot more of a walk than you think Had we known parking is cheap (under 10 bucks for some GREAT parking) we would have stayed FARTHER out at a Hilton."
4192,Great tortillas and tamales served with sticky floors scary bathrooms and regularly overflowing waste cans hurts Carolina's reputation If they could hose the place down once in awhile it would definately get more stars from me.
3656,My feelings about Cafe Rio turned dubious when I saw prices higher than Chipotle or Qdoba with fewer meat choices (no carnitas) The dubiousness doubled down when  I got a look at the fixingsIt was a long look as the large staff seemed utterly uninclined to wait on me After a long while one gal pointed me out to another who smiled at her coworker and went back to whatever she was doing with the grill At this point I gave up and leftThe idea that checking off store tasks is way more important than waiting on customers probably comes from management so I'm not going to blame the very young and probably inexperienced staff But if it's your business model to figure that customers can damned well wait until somebody gets around to them and there's no hurry or need to even acknowledge them waiting then you'd best be either way cheaper or way better quality than your competition There is no reason I'd give Cafe Rio a second chanceI went to one of the other restaurants in the same strip and had a very nice experience there.
3291,This place was a huge disappointment After hearing how it had been recognized on the Food Network I went there with a friend on a Sunday evening and found the food to be mediocre and overpriced The waiter also tried desperately to get us to purchase wine and sides I finally relented to an order of garlic bread and was served plain stale bread For this stale bread we got charged $3 I will not be going back If you want Italian Red Devil is a better deal with a nicer atmosphere and better wait staff Oh yeah the bread is good and complimentary.
3279,I really don't understand the fascination with Fairytale Brownies  They are cloyingly sweet grainy and if they weren't brown you wouldn't know they were chocolate flavored and the flavored ones leave an artificial aftertaste  We used to receive these as gifts at the office from vendors and this was always one snack to skip.
3757,DONT COME HERE Groupon users beware I saw a sweet deal on groupon (15$ for four people for open skate) that was only a sweet deal online The skates were so worn our feet had bruises on them afterwards The lady who helped us with our skate size gave us all a size up even when we asked for a smaller size It was so uncomfortable and very difficult to skate it in As we managed to make the best of it  but could not bare we headed off the ice and a hockey coach saw our shoes were to big and mentioned next time we should get smaller skates on our way out We also got off the ice because they rushed us off by starting to cleaning the ice 20 minutes before our time was up Oh yeah It's also very hidden and hard to find.
3926,My lady friend got really annoyed the other day at Paradise Bakery and was almost in tears over the stress endured trying to order a simple lettuce and tomato salad and some blue cheese dressing on top She got something completely different and an ass chewingShe explained perfectly what she wanted while being prodded down the chute by a young manager and a couple of fellas on the line that had not yet mastered the English language After a completely unnecessary lecture by this manager fella who seemed annoyed that anyone would dare ask a question to slow down the ringing of the almighty cash register they completely disregarded her request and gave her a bowl of miscellaneous pasture weeds and a sweet balsamic dressing  She was frazzled and pissed when we sat down but not one to complain I witnessed the entire thing and they could have easily given her a bowl of romaine some tomato and blue cheese dressingThis having been my first time I'd been in a Paradise Cafe for lunch the entire experience seemed a little awkward I had to look around to find any type of menu and all I saw was sandwiches  After I ordered I saw the salad menu but it was too dam late I was already down the end of the line where they clip your ear and brand your backside with a sandwich built their way with no choice of bread cheese or even the cookieWildflower seems to cater much better to the soup salad and sandwich consumer than Paradise Cafe I like it when a restaurant has well thought out menus and they don't treat you like cattle.
3657,"I am posting the following from my wife:Over the past 5 years I have been a patient of Dr Garza and had referred many friends and we were all very happy at first  I am not sure what happened in the last couple of years but at the very least we have all been very disappointed  Dr Garza removed sealants which promptly became cavities mis-billed causing patients to be over charged and at one point did a root canal leaving shards of tooth behind He said he knew it was there on the x-ray then saying it would not be a problem  I then went on vacation and ended up with an abscess so bad that I had to have emergency oral surgery with no anesthetic because there was too much swelling  These emergency services had to be paid in cash because we were out of network and had to see an emergency dentist  8 out of the 10 days of our vacation were ruined because Dr Garza chose to take a chance things would be ok instead of doing the right thing and removing the shard  A few months later I receive a bill for that extraction as it was not covered because he had worked on it before  I called and spoke to the new billing person and was told not to worry about it and so I didn't  Now we find out it was sent to collections   Absolutely the worst patient care I have ever had  Not one of the six families I had referred still sees him  On every dental insurance website he has been flagged with some unusual code He routinely charges extra for services that would be covered by in network dentists There was always some ""special"" case for billing extra and the excuses just got way to tiring Dr Garza is not a place I would suggest anyone to go."
1049,Everything at Reathrey is full of fresh herbs flavor soothing amazing fragrances and probably some voodoo Maybe a little magicBest of its category in Arizona by far Oh and I don't think I've ever said this about anywhere ever but get the corn Absolutely get the corn.

1355,Outstanding  I get my haircut every week so I have high standards  I just moved here from Texas and was pretty worried about finding a new barber  This place has not let me down  No need to worry about finding the right barber either  All of the staff are very good at what they do.
163,I recently got relocate to Phoenix from las vegas at first I was so depressed because there is no 24hr pho restaurants like there is in las Vegas and to me eating pho and going to walmart at 3am is my favorite thing to doI came to this restaurant today because all the good reviews after work and let me tell youit was the best bowl of pho I ever had I got the fried rice with chicken and pork and a no 1 large and my friend got s regular no 1 and the bill was only $1850 wow what a good price and I told myself I want to eat here everyday lol.
3616,I rcvd a fantastic car wash at this business  Spent 30 bucks thought was a lil high but turned out to be one of the best car washes I ever hadBUT I WILL NEVER GO THERE AGAIN I have arthritis in both shoulders and use pain pills mostly at bed time to control the pain  I had my small bottle that I keep in the SUV just in case  And my script bottle that I brought with me as I am traveling and staying at a hotel I know the pills were there cause I checked twice on the way to Phoenix I kept them in the middle console Last night when I was done working I reached in and found no pain pills They left the allergy pills thank goodness but my night in bed was sleepless.
3999,Another Groupon casualty  I bought several Groupons for this location and used only one  Then we went to go use another one the other day and *BAM* it's gone  Another one bites the dustReturn Factor - An obvious 0%.
656,They claim to have the best carne asada in town I believe them All I had was a carne asada burrito so this 5-star review is based on a single item.
150,A very affordable place to go to get Fresh Asian food  Better than most Asian buffets  Definitely one of the best Asian places The taste of the food is right on The mark  Close to the Wigwam Resort  Great west side Asian Bistro- fresh ingredients (try the hot and sour soup).
1691,This is a great place Very fun barlots of tv's for sports And most importantly the BBQ is awesome All smoked on site and all different types Definitely worth checking out.
4617,I've thought about this before writing this because of being a small business owners and understanding that maybe the owners and staff just had a bad day  I didn't want to write this because everyone is entitled to their own opinion of services and food and didn't want to damage another business reputation with just my opinion So here it goesMy son and I go here to eat all the time because it's convenient instead of having to drive all the way out to Phoenix or Mesa for really good Pho  It's good not great by any means but could be great if you just don't know anything about Pho  However the service here is the worst I've ever experienced  I know that Pho places really aren't known for service but this place is just rude  Try Unphogettable in Mesa so you can see what good food and service is about and you will know what I mean about rude hereI've just always put up with it because it's just typical of Pho restaurants  So headed back to work my friend asked me to pick up an order to go for her  After waiting for about 20 minutes after we were done eating for the to go order even though we placed the order when we ordered our other food too the order came back wrong  I told the pregnant owner what our correct order was  She placed the order by the registered and left us there hanging  After another 20 minutes I asked for the order again  She said they are too busy and have decided not to correct the order  I asked her why she didn't tell me and would just make me sit there and wait  No answer other than that she is too busy to deal with it  So I pay and put under the tip line none because poor service  Actually wrote that in so that they won't write in their tips which they have done once before on me I reconciled my statement over the weekend and pull out my receipt  Apparently I have now also been charged the to go order even though I didn't take it  Called and she answered and argues with me that I took the order  This is ridiculous  We are not some scam artist or willing to lie over some $9 order  Tried to explain to her that we did not but she just hung up the phone on me  Wow  Talk about hormonal.
3049,On my little trip around the city I drove over to Sweet Pea Very cute store and great personable staffNice selection to baked goods and great tasteWhat nice find in the downtown area I've got Wicked Bakery up north and Sweet Pea downtown North and South is covered for those sudden cravings now time to find something on the on West and East sides of the city.
3004,So I was looking to get a Yoga mat and thought that Dicks would be a great place to go to get something like that  I know this location is brand new as I used to live right near it and literally watched them build it from the ground upThis location has amazing hours  Open late most nights and is right off the expressway  you cant miss it  Its in the same district as Ikea off the I-10Anyways this place is well lit has a ton of parking and is so well organized its not even funny  Not a thing was out of place  It has two floors and carries a ton of stuff  I cruised through the womens section of clothing and they have shoes running stuff you name it its there   I was able to find the Yoga mats and they had a little selection in the back of the store  Did I mention this place is really well litAnyways they had a small variety of mats  They also had a beginner mat set that came with a video a block and a yoga strap  25 bucks  most of the mats I saw were about 20 bucks alone so for the extra 5 bucks I sprug for the extras  I think I got a pretty good dealWhile I was wandering around a staff member asked if there was anything I needed  Just talked to him for a minute about yoga mats and he said that was the only spot in the store that they would be at  Seemed to know his stuffI really like Dick's Sporting goods  Well organized amazing hours well lit friendly staff  I will return in the future.
2759,Outstanding the butternut squash ravioli and grouper clams and scallops simply the best meal we have had in quite awhile.
696,I have been going there at least once a week since they opened (for food and coffee) and the staff is always pleasant the food is always good and the coffee is always terrific Great atmosphere inside and out So glad to hear they are opening another store at Scottsdale Quarter Now I can finally get some GOOD coffee when I am in the Kierland area.
4075,Although the dental practice looks professional and clean the staff was not genuous in their concerns of my comfort Yes they said what you wanted to hear but you can tell when someone is not sincere As soon as I said I wasn't sure about coming back or my discomfort when I had my teeth cleaning they called me everyday Not to check up to see how I was doing with the tooth I originally came in for care but to see how quickly they can give up my appointment to fit in someone elseEveryday at least twice a day they called and not one of those calls or messages were to ask about my pain on the tooth That's when you know the dentist and staff isn't about your comfort and health of your teeth Yes we are all in business to make money but money comes  with success of making your patients happy not treating them like another dollar sign And to be charge more than $1200 for a teeth cleaning is ridiculous.
2684,This is the OG triple OG Quiktrip The summer this one opened in high school they had free soda FOR THREE MONTHS It was the best summer of my life All Quiktrips dominate all gas stations and convenience stores The staff is always friendly and you never have to wait in line cause they check you out as fast as possible I get kinda anxious cause everyone is moving so freaking fast and it makes me nervous Their donuts are F'n amazing Their Maple Bars are the size of your F'n forearm and melt in your mouth Their deli sandwiches and breakfast sandwiches are great They sell cold 2 liters and 12 packs of soda I would live in a convenience store if I could My wife hates going with me cause I like to walk around looking for new snacks and take my time like I am in Toys R Us or something All Quiktrips are awesome and would pick it over ANY store out there.
941,Can't get enough Everything is delicious and doesn't feel heavy I could eat here everyday.
4076,"Worst food in 2011 and that includes food trucks and fast food It looked like an old place that had been around a long time and I usually have good luck with places like that - not htis time I had the ""samon fillet"" which was extremely dry and tasteless - I have had beef jerky with a higher moisture content - the best thing on my plate were the soggy unseasoned canned greenbeans My wife got the liver and onions and no one was able to eat two bites - dry gritty horrible One of my sons had the fried shrimp special and that was the only OK plate (and the only one in the family that actually finished his dinner) - it was just typical deep fried shrimp from a bag of frozen but at least it was not scr*wed up I noticed that there were many more people in the bar than the dining section so the drinks may be OK but I will never try the food again."
1684,I love love love Baskin- Robins Again another place i grew up eating ice cream at ever since in Elementary school so definitely over 15 years  I love their two scoop ice cream sundaes with whip cream hot fudge almonds and cherry  I typically always chose chocolate chip  They make it super fast  So if you ever want just regular ice cream and not yogurt i would go here  I've also purchased ice cream cakes for birthdays and they are sooo good.
3347,I loved this place when I moved in  I thought it was perfect  I had a great view from my balcony steps away from Pita Jungle and Lola Coffee  There was a park right across the street for my dogs to run around in  I didn't think much of it when then management changed from Greystar to Birkshire  Didn't see any huge differences  They seemed really friendly until I decided to move out  And then they make it their job to screw me out of every last dollar to my nameI will admit I had a fast move out  I forgot a box in the apartment and I didn't have a maid service come in and do a professional cleaning  I figured paying a few hundred dollars wasn't that big of a deal to save me the hassleAnd then I got the $1300 bill  Yes you read that correctly  There are two zeros at the end of that number  They charged me $1300 to clean a 700 sf apartment  I did what any sane person in my situation would do and I refused to pay it  That is until I was sent to collections and faced destroying my credit and rental historySo I settled it with the collection agency and moved on with my life  I genuinely thought that Roosevelt Square was done ruining my life  I was wrong again Almost a year later I put in an application for another apartment complex and was told that my credit report shows that I STILL owe money to Roosevelt Square and that they cannot rent to me unless I can provide them with documentation that this debt was paidSo I called Roosevelt Square and SURPRISE they have no record of my settlement with them  In fact they came up with another $500 that they claim I still owe them  My only option at that point was to contact the debt collection agency  They were able to provide me with a copy of my settlement in full letter in under an hour  A debt collection agency was more helpful and more competent than this joke of an officeRoosevelt Square looks really nice is in a great location and has a bunch of really awesome amenities  But so do all of the other apartment complexes in the area  Do yourself a favor  Move somewhere else and stay away from this bottomless money pit.
2326,When one thinks of the Wild West the state of Arizona is usually close to the top of the list Playing an important part in the development of the Southwest Arizona has some wonderful places with historical significance for all you history buffsThe Vulture Gold Mine is one of these places Just outside the town of Wickenburg the Vulture Gold Mine was discovered in 1863 by Henry Wickenburg Although Henry sold the mine after a few years the mine went on to become the most productive gold strike in the history of Arizona and sparked the development of Arizona and the city of PhoenixThe fee to participate in the tour is $10 but it is a small price to pay for the sheer volume of information and artifacts that are on the property site The tours are self paced and on-your-own When you visit the tour center you receive a comprehensive overview of the mine and it's history from the current caretaker as well as a map that identifies the points of interestMost of the buildings while in various states of disrepair are still standing Many contain original furnishings machinery and reminders of everyday life such as cooking utensils cans and bottles for coffee and such One such building with a large variety of these items is the Assay Office where the gold was stored prior to shipment There are some areas of the mine that are not open to the public but since my grandfather worked at the mine the caretaker gave us full reign to wander all over the property The schoolhouse where my Uncle John attended school is still standing and contains a piano that we are certain he played as a child The swings slide and teeter-totter are still there and my mom could recall memories about those days despite the fact that she was just a toddler when they lived at the mineIf you ever have the opportunity to visit the Vulture Mine take it I am an Arizona native with family ties to the mine and I still learned a ton of information about what an important part the mine played in Arizona's historyPS - While you are there don't forget to scratch Olive the burro's ears.
3080,"I am done with the Armitage I have been here several times over the past few years and other than being overpriced the food and service was always good A couple of months ago we went there for a birthday lunch I ordered the Garden Veggie Pita How can one mess up a veggie sandwich How about putting it on a stale pita bread that cracks in two when you pick it up Since it was my B-Day I didn't want to make any comments especially since I wasn't the one paying A couple of weeks ago we went there on a Sunday I ordered the beef and Gorgonzola melt and my partner ordered a burger medium rare When the plates were delivered I noticed that the slices of sirloin resembled small chunky pieces of beef jerky the mushrooms were dry and shriveled and the Gorgonzola melt part looked like a wipe of mayo I have had this before and the sirloin was always juicy and tender on the medium rare side I brought this to the servers attention who immediately said ""that's how it's made"" I told him that I've had it before and it definitely did not resemble my prior visits No comment from the server I ate it since at that point I didn't want to make a scene and it was horrid My partner's ""medium-well"" burger was very well done She decided not to complain due to the fact that we don't really see what goes on in kitchens when we complain do we We didn't have an opportunity to even let the server know we were disappointed since we didn't see him until the end of the meal At that point we made it clear that we were very disappointed and showed him the doneness of the burger I reiterated how horrible the beef jerky sandwich was and he then offered to comp We settled on a free dessert He also gave us coupons which was a nice gesture Too bad he didn't listen to me the first time To the owner: when a repeat customer says he had something before and that there is now something wrong have your people pay attention Don't make excuses for an incompetent kitchen However based on what your staff said IF it is now your intention to provide an overdone dried out sliced sirloin sandwich and  to overcook burgers regardless of the order then you have no business in the food business If not then you better get in that kitchen and fix it because this sort of news travels fast in my community In my book two strikes and you are out Sorry but there are better choices out there and if I am going to spend 100 bucks on lunch it better be damn good You're just not good anymore I will not be back."
548,"This property just lost a customer and everybody we tell about our stay  Do not fall for the free breakfast bit  We booked through Priceline which indicates a free breakfast  We had a sub-par breakfast -which would have been fine if it were included  However we were charged almost $3000 for two  When we told the front desk Priceline indicates the breakfast was free they referred us to the small print  I asked ""what can you do for us""  The reply was ""nothing""  Small print or no small print a property that is unwilling to comp a breakfast to save a customer - when they certainly have the ability to do so - is not going to get my business  What was supposed to be a short one-night getaway for a weary mom and dad of young children ended on a very sour note."
2919,Cave and Ives is an excellent restaurant Great food great drinks and great atmosphere I love the drink selection They have more beers than I could possibly try in a year The food is always delicious and they frequently have specials unlike anything on the menu I love the layout and feel of the restaurant Casual dinner environment with a fantastic patio My recommendations: Crispy Bravas Fries Chopped Salad Red Goat Pizza Sicilian Pizza Lemon Chicken and Artichoke Pasta.
2259,I came there with a coupon Withing 5 seconds I was upsold for something $5 more expensive My fault but it was just the beginning The nice young man went on to ask me three time if I wanted detailing I said I didn't  Then we waisted another 3 minutes talking about the services I didn't need  When I finally got to the register and after my bill was brought on later the charge for detailing was there Again they judged me right $ 20 is not a big deal I didn't go back to argue I am now on my third hour of waiting The room is full of people in the same situation  The Guy next to me is joking  we must be getting our money worth for it to take so long It looks like they talked or tricked a lot of people into buying the service knowing they do not have enough people to handle it.
2683,"Granted that they have just opened  However they have several other outlets around town so there is no excuse really  If you are up in the bustier ranges skip this particular location  They advertise that they go up to size 42DD however the selection is pathetic  The young woman who was ""helping"" us didn't even offer to measure my friend  She just took my friend's word for the size  Now anyone who has ever shopped for a bra knows that different brands will fit differently - and this is supposed to be an upscale joint right  The girl who has ""helping"" my friend get going to answer the phone and was walking around with a phone to her ear while looking for bras  Not classy  Then when my friend was trying on bras she was off talking to another girl who was plopped on a seat in the back apparently texting to pass the time  I don't know if she was working but she was not a pretty picture  I finally intervened and ASKED THE BOZO CLERK to measure my friend  We went from a 42 D to a 38 D - gee  I finally gave up and just went in with my friend and helped her to fit her bra  There used to be a magic bra fitter at Dillard's in Mesa who taught me everything about fitting a bra - and I thank her today for that  The service was so low-rent  It was not at all what I expected  I have gotten more help at Wal-Mart for crying out loud  The bra ended up costing 35 bucks - not unreasonable - in fact  pretty darned inexpensive as I was expecting more expensive wares  But the whole experience was absolutely the pits  I mentioned this location at my pilates class and as it turned out two other women had similar experiences  One went out to Kirland Commons and said it was a much improved experience  She and I would never waste our time at the Biltmore location  We had to go over to the Hagen Daaz store and gaze at the chocolate to get over this disaster."
1030,Walked into Jimmy John's at 6pm on 10/31 to see a man with a large dog waiting for food at the pickup end of the counter The dog was not a seeing eye dog or one in training Dog had its front feet up on the counter and the people behind the counter were talking to the dog Pretty disgusting for food being prepared 1 or 2 feet away No thanks.
3878,I ordered take out for twoduring breakfast (steak and eggs with gritts biscuitsand gravy) I placed my biscuits on top off my gritts put my eggs on top of my biscuits and poored my gravy over all of it As I dove into my ' heart attack waiting to happen' I dicovered a very thick black hair aproximatley 3 inches in length Needless to say  I didnt finish my meal.
64,"In order to arrange a upcoming UYE ""Butter Party ""  Jim  Audrey Donald  Amy B  Heather  and myself set up a little waffle exploration meeting  For the good of the order we met up to partake in the phenomenon known as ""waffles and chicken "" To be fully prepared for the UYE we ate to our hearts content  I have to be honest and not lie that I fully loved every scrumptious morsel From the yummy waffle tasty chicken  to the  yummy cornbread  it was all good but the highlight of my eating was the macaroni and cheese creamy  sublime  rich  crusty in places sharp cheese laced man I really like that stuff I didn't know if I should share the delicious treat with my family or squirrel it away in my purse to savor later   Kids loved it  waffles and fried food goes over big in our family The service was exceptionally good courteous  well thought out  and  made the place Decor is a bit of whimsy with homey flair  Bright and airy  fresh and  comfortable  Love the big old mason jars for drinks  nice down home touch folks   We met the manager who was very nice and willing to make all of our UYE dreams come true She also informed us that they will be opening soon for the late night crowd from 5pm-3am Simply can't wait to go back Anybody busy tomorrow."
4742,"Furniture shopping is supposed to be fun and after finally being able to afford something that isn't at Walmart or a hand-me-down I was looking forward to itThanks Ashley for making it a painful and stressful process I originally reviewed Yelp and several of the typical AZ chain stores websites (Room Store Mor Ashley etc) Ashley seemed to have the best options (but no pricing) so I went there first Ugh Big mistake First off--they have A MILLION sales people there who creepily stalk you from the MOMENT you get in the door You end up walking around the store trying to avoid the guys/girls in black shirts who continually ask you if you need help and try to sell the furniture (Um yeah thanks but it doesn't matter to me if this piece is your favorite or what warranties it comes withI need to measure and visualize this piece in my home which only I can do hopefully undistributed) It's WORSE than buying a car It makes you want to leave the store but you can't because you need/want furnitureI did like a few of their dining room tables and couches but everything was SO expensive Like overpriced expensive I don't mind paying more for quality or customer service but I just felt like I was getting ripped off every minute I was there However at the end of the day I walked away with a table in mind and went home to confirm measurements I ended up checking a few more stores to make sure it was ""the one"" and I actually found one that I liked WAY better and was $150 cheaper at Mor (with NO pushy salespeople)Oh and they don't include measurements on the item tagI think this is ploy to make you talk to a sales rep because they all carry tape measures but they only let you borrow it while they linger around and watch you take measurements talking the ENTIRE timeBottom Line: Ashley's stuff is fine and you can probably find something you like and want to buy but their sales approach and prices aren't worth it--shop around The furniture stores I visited after Ashley (Razmataz Mor random other stores had NORMAL sales people who asked you once if you needed help and then left you alone)."
4072,"Went to buy a 2014 4-door Fiat 500L Trekking model After advising what colors and options we wanted we were advised one was available in the valley (in storage) & would be ready for pick up next day We called the next afternoon to confirm delivery and were told the one matching was dented and/or scratched Told another matching could be brought from Vegas but it'd be several days for delivery An hour later received a call and told another found in Tempe and to come to Scottsdale by 6pm Upon arrival paperwork had both my and my spouse's names misspelled with numbers in our address transposed Dealership still wanted us to sign on the incorrect documents Waited for another 30 minutes and another salesman finally pulled up in ""our"" car with his two kids in back with hands on the windows Windows weren't tinted (as promised) and anti-scratch coating not on yet (per salesman) Vehicle color scheme was wrong No Trekking-style trim on vehicle either Manager then advised he could have told us the day before no vehicles matching our wants (including the dented/scratched one) was even available within 400 miles Waste of time and gas for this BAIT AND SWITCH."
4179,Last week I went on yelp to find a good alterations place to fix two pairs of pants and a shirt of mine Creations & Alterations had some good reviews and it was down the street from my apartment I dropped off my clothes thinking it wouldn't take more than 2-3 days I dropped it off on a Tuesday and they told me it'd be ready the NEXT week Thursday At the time I didn't care and just wanted it done I came in the next week Friday morning before I drove out to California intending to wear my newly fixed jeans and they said it wasn't ready They hadn't even started on it They asked if I could spare an hour for them to fix it which just added insult to injury being informed that they sat on my clothes for a week and a half when everything could have been taken care of in an hour I asked for my clothes back and will NEVER come back again 0 stars.
2291,From what I can tell I don't think Dick's wants your business With no sign out front and as hard as it is to find you have to be in the know to give the aptly titled Hideaway a try  But search for it you must for it is truly one of the best breakfasts I have ever had the pleasure of consuming I'm a huge fan of Mexican style breakfasts and the Huevos Rancheros are insane Two eggs any style served on a blue corn tortilla smothered with green or red chile and cheese served with potatoes and beans and it is enough for two people  Just look at the pictures posted by the other Yelpers people  You can tell just by looking at the photos that this place is going to be awesome  Just go in and give this place a try already (if you can find it)  How many more five star reviews do you need.
4333,I have just purchased a sectional sofa from here for our family room they offered us next day delivery which I thought at the time was great being that it was just before the Christmas Holliday Well everything looked great until I really had a chance to spend time looking at it on my first day off which was 5 days later and I noticed two strange faded like spots one on the back of the sofa which is covered by the throw pillows and the other by where the fold of your legs would hit At first I thought it was just the sun making a shadowing effect but I was wrong We called the room store customer service and they sent someone out 5 days later and then they followed up with a call telling us it was normal wear REALLY I didn't even have it for a week The sale person was the manager at the store his name was jack although he was polite they DO NOT  Stand behind there furniture I would never shop buy or tell anyone to buy or even look at anything in this store ever They are very unprofessional when it comes to standing behind there product Very unhappy Jacque.
1971,OUTRAGEOUSLY HIGH-PRICED  food quality not bad but not that good either You can just get your sushi at Costco or Fry's and not feel you were    had Food portions are too small The serving size of the appetizers are way too small not filling enough even for a toddler We had to eat at McDonald's after.
3813,Arrived with a large group - You can almost see the $$ signs in the waiters and wine steward eyes  The wine suggested was a great producer but in no way fit to be drank  It was a huge bottle that needed to be moved and we bought in  The waiter did not even notice the spilled sauces on the table the crumbs in every corner or that  silverware for next course was not all placed  Too bad I had to ask my neighbor for her knife  No offer of coffee or after dinner drinks  Food was OK  But service was offal I prefer a quick serve restaurant that notices a detail or to  Did I mention the 18% on an $800 dollar check  I think I will celebrate some place else next time.
445,"What  LOL this place is HELL  Back in my hometown of Chicago this is where all the My-New-Haircut-Guys would gather to act like they had culture because they were slamming Sake-Bombs and butting chests togetherI had a taste for sushi it was on my way I peeked inside and thought to myself ""This can't be as bad as it looks""  Oh yeah it can  Note to the owners:  no you cannot have BOTH a hip little sushi restaurant AND a sports bar  It's loud it's crowded I had vegetable maki and it STILL smelled like old fish  It's cheap I'll give them that  But if I had to deal with this place again a chop stick would end up going through a baseball cap and into a skull."
1039,I've been banking with Chase for over a year and a half now but out of all the branches I've walked into this one takes the cake It helps that I work right across the parking lot but it's also a newer branch so it's up to date and modern They host a networking function every few months inviting all the surrounding businesses to stop by and share what they do with each other They go all out too supplying all kinds of food and drink (also from the local businesses) The manager tellers and personal bankers here have been extremely helpful in getting my accounts in order I do my banking at this branch whenever possible.
4829,OK yogurt way too expensive Yogurtini in Tempe has been my favorite Only 39 cents an ounce Better toppings and yogurt was definitely better.
4972,I used to be a huge fan of this place until last night I went in to find a nice dress to wear After wandering the store looking for the plus size section (I proudly wear a size 18) and not finding anything I asked the clerk where it was Apparently they no longer carry anything over a size 16Talk about being disappointed I was so upset I almost cried Shame on you You should also put a sign up now so that girls like me don't waste our time wondering through your store anymore.
2193,I used to go to nation wide This place is much better Very friendly staff and great building First class.
3160,Closed    Much of the center is vacant except for Ranch 99 and a couple of small shops    Very sad.
809,Some of the best pizza anywhere  Period.
871,Experienced hummus xpress for the first time tonight and truly enjoyed the experience The staff was very friendly and helpful and guided me through making my dish The food was great I am a fairly picky person and was pleased to find that I loved it Definitely recommend.
1488,Love their BLT and their pizzammmm  One of my favorite local pizza joints  Right there with The Parlor Bianco etcNever tried their breakfast but rumor has itit's good.
1605,This is one of my favorite places to get what I think is the best Prime Rib in the valley The service is always very friendly and efficient and the atmosphere is lends itself perfectly to couples looking for a little romance Everything is a bit pricey but worth every penny When you order Prime Rib you get a salad and a choice of two sides Plus their spinach dip is awesome.
3436,Went in on labor day 2011 at around 1:30pm with my fiance Was told the kitchen was backed up TWO HOURS What the hell is up with that Who the hell do they have back there preparing the dishes That is a bunch a crap If they can't handle being busy then they need to get outa the kitchen Will never go back there Very disapointed:(.
4517,Staff  won't respond after 5 emails for the over charging by the Vue for so called damages once the student has moved out Staff  promised to send  all bills paid to there vendors for repair work and the break down between the six students living in the apartment and pictures of all damage Parents be a ware of the Vues billing practicesThey even state they will attach your students or your credit but will not provide the proof requested I would not let my student stay there again.
2011,Ask Jimmy to make your burger spicy  It's AWESOME  Food and service is the best we experienced in Phoenix (and we tried all the big name restaurants).
1642,Almost didn't go because of the reviews about the service but went anyway because it was close and was in the mood for wings Food was very good (wings were cooked just right extra crispy) The best part was the service our waiter was on time with everything and best of all we had to sit outside (52 degrees) because it was a playoff game and showed up in the fourth quarter and we did not bring a coat for our five year old daughter so the hostess went into the back and let her wear a BWW sweatshirt We will go back for sure.
318,This review is particular to the 'Block Party' that Whole Foods puts on  I was invited by Yelp's own Ivonne B who ended up being my block party tour guideShe took us on a tour of the store stopping at several locations for a tasting sample  I've never had grilled pineapple before and it was such a treat  It was also my first time for Indian CandyIvonne is a spitfire and made our time spent there enjoyable and entertaining because she has a real passion for food and nutritionSure I love Whole Foods as much as the next person but the 'Block Party' proved to be the consummation of our loveAnd Ivonne let me in on a little Whole Foods customer secret which if it got into the wrong hands could be abused  I'll let you inquire directly from her.
2047,I love this park always something fun going on  I love the ponds and I like sit by the waterfalls and think  My dogs love going there with me and they love to check out the ducks  One of my favorite places in Gilbert.
4023,If you are craving basic nothing special breakfast food save yourself the hour long wait outside in the 100 degree heat and go eat at Denny's or IHOP  Trust me you'll pay half as much and leave feeling less ickyI seriously don't understand the draw of this place  The whole restaurant seats maybe 20-30 people so we ended up sitting outside in the heat for over an hour waiting for a table  Other reviews claim much longer wait times  When we finally got a table our waitress was friendly enough and got our drink orders pretty promptly  When they brought us our food  was nothing special just eggs bacon and hashbrowns  The quality was no better than what you might get at any typical breakfast joint  Seriously Food Network I don't understand what all the fuss is about  The waitress forgot to bring us our bread  After two requests and our meal just about finished our bread was finally delivered to the table  Unfortunately my boyfriend's bread had a little something extraa nice long hair  Disgusting  Never again.
4155,"Never again will I come here There was absolutely no courtesy to the customer from the second I walked through the door They asked me if I was there for eyebrows Instead of asking ""what can we do for you"" their followup was: you want a full setThey did not seem willing to do even the most simple design on real nails unless I wanted acrylics I have seen plenty of people get simple designs on their actual nails with the final result looking amazing so I'm not sure what their deal wasNot to mention this was the most painful manicure ever She hurt me when fixing my cuticles Their nail buffer felt more like a nail file and she continuously caught my skin at the base of the nailI have been to low-budget places that still have good manner and are personable with their customer even with language barriersand I got absolutely ZERO satisfaction from this place I wish I could erase this from my day off and start my morning over Aren't you supposed to leave salons feeling a little pampered."
3320,Tried breakfast lunch and dinner here and the food was terrible  The only nice features are the friendly dinner staff and the nice golf course view during the day  Since those two features can be easily obtained elsewhere I would not recommend this placeBreakfast- the eggs and sausages were fine but the oatmeal was overcooked and service was completely lacking despite the fact that the restaurant was not even half full  Steak salad- ordered the steak medium rare  It came overly smoked completely overcooked and tasted like beef jerky  The spinach was also not freshVegetable soup- tasted fine but nothing special Chicken Caesar- the dressing was fine but the lettuce was somewhat blackened  The chicken was also blackened and overcooked  Tater Tots- tasted fine although a bit dry  Overall this is at best a two star restaurant.
890,In the age of credit cards debit cards online and mobile banking I don't find myself going much further than the ATM when it comes to going to the bank  However  Once in a great while I do find myself needing to go inside the bank to use a service or see a teller and this branch actually makes me miss those good old days of human interactionThe employees are really friendly  The kind of friendly where in the couple of minutes it took to withdraw money into a cashier's check I think the teller and manager knew my whole life story  I'm not really a conversationalist when it comes strangers but they always manage to break me out of shell.
4177,We had guests visiting from California so we decided to take them out to BJ's for dessert for their famous pizookie What a horrible idea Each one of us had it and each one of us got sick I mean sick like vomiting and diarrhea Will never go back there again.
2621,Easily my favorite Filipino restaurant ever of all-time hands down Their prices are reasonable for exceptional food and drinks Has a well stocked bar plenty of TVs This a great place for event dinners as well The staff is very generous and easy to talk to Most places have pros and cons this restaurant the exception for having all pros If you try this place then I'd expect to see a review similar to this.
706,One of our favorite places for Lunch or Dinner Great selection of local mini-brew beers About the only thing they lack is WiFi.
3166,Don't want to even give Lon's one star Had dinner at Lon's in early August It was highly recommended by the concierge of the hotel where we stayed This is the worst restaurant meal I have ever had There were twelve in our group and ten of the twelve meals were unacceptable Not only were the entrees horrible the appetizers and desserts were equally bad The food was bland and flavorless For example my entree was served with truffle gnocchi This should be full of flavor The $4900 steak was loaded with fat and cooked wrong One of them was sent back the other only partially eaten Oh and don't be fooled by the tuna on the lava rockflavorless When this was pointed out to the server and a manager they did not know how to handle the situation I as well as the concierge contacted the food and beverage manager Dave He couldn't have been more rude Said he would contact me and never did Also according to the concierge he said he would contact her as wellnever did There are way too many good restaurants in this area to waste your money at Lon's and they don't appreciate your business I would go to The Mission Elements or Pizzaria Bianco over Lon's AVOID  this restaurant at all cost.
1937,I've just found out about this place a week ago and so far it's pretty awesome Vietnamese food I've actually been eating here for the past 4 days Everyday for dinner Their seasoning is very palatable to the taste And priced very reasonable actually very cheap I've had the pho chao long Banh xeo com ga nuong Bo nuong la nho mi Sui Cao bun bo hue and they are all very delicious I don't know about the reviewer saying that the Banh xeo( Vietnamese crepes) was yuck he probably never had it before and don't know what it's SUPPOSED to taste like and making a review of something he doesn't know anything about But their Banh xeo is actually very good It's crispy which is hard to accomplish and has all the fillings balanced You're supposed to dip it into the nuoc Cham to get all the flavors out of the dish I'm Vietnamese and a very picky eater and this restaurant serves really good home cooked Vietnamese dishes.
3366,I cancelled due to the problems with the facility I mentioned earlier Hell I think almost everyone has had the same problems with this placeThey give you two ways of canceling: Via US mail (they print out a form you provide the envelope and stamp) or in-person during the 9-6 business day Monday-Friday when one of the managers is on duty Why I couldn't cancel online in real time or in person during the weekend No one knew At least they were cheerful about itIn the end nothing much had changed despite complaints from me and I am sure many other members The locker room  and shower area is still dirty the floor is still filled with a lot of rickety treadmills and it's still probably worth the $30/mo for the determined but not if you don't feel like going.
1707,One of the best sandwiches in this town I eat here every Friday Fresh bread with fresh high quality ingredients You get what you pay for It's worth it.
1236,As  new transplant to Phoenix I was so happy to find this place on groupon  After the stress of flying from NYC 8 months pregnant and with our cat having dinner here was like a dream  Everything was delicious portions were filling and it was just so relaxing  We had the duck special and the salmon along with snails and the goat cheese toast triangles- everything was made just right   We had a great time  Also everyone was very nice  This place would fit right in in Brooklyn or Paris  Glad it is in Phoenix.
3392,Pre-purchased a wax for $89 with paperwork indicating full wax job clay and etc   I came back a month later to have car waxed sales or detailing manager told me that I only bought to only have left side of door waxed and tried to sell me another wax which I already bought and clearly indicated on paperwork Finally they realized i was aware of scheme and said would wax the entire car   However to find out an hour later  my car was not waxed but just sprayed with a liquid shine on certain area of car    Because my car was new and expensive I didn't want to argue to have it done right and risk them harming my paint  The next day I waxed the car myself which you can clearly teell the difference of car that has been waxed   Don't pre-purchase services from this place and do not use them as they are dishonest.
2018,Yumm That definitely hit the spotI was a bit confused by their menu but it's pretty simple There's not that much to choose from but everything on there is G O O DI had the combo and 1 dollar soda (free refills) This is a moms and pops shop I love it It totally deserves a 5 star C'mon ppl.
2566,"I moved from Arizona so my review is for experiences up to 2/2008I LOVE this bar It's definitely my favorite place to go in Old Town The rare occasions that I'd go to Myst I would always come here first for the cheaper drinksPros-Lots of room to sitYou don't have to be dressed up at all to come hereHappy Hour 1/2 all wells beer wine and food M-F 4-7 (sidenote: it used to be 4-9 disappointed that they've shortened it)Relatively cheaper drinks than the rest of the bars in this area I would always drink during happy hour so bottles were less than $2Bartenders are super nice I've always chatted them up and service is pretty good Even when it's crowded on a weekend night you don't have to wait too long for a drink from the barThe WINGS Just try them I haven't had better wings anywhere elseThey stay open after 2 because they're a ""restaurant"" Great place to go after the other bars close for some foodCons-Cover after 8pm (or 8:30) Easy just get there before thenThe crowd changes around 10pm when all of the club people come here to pre-drink."
324,Really good burger I got the Mexican burger and it was great And not to expensive.
332,Still get 5 stars Went back again yesterday for some of that Poutine Glllrrrbbbl Had a hard time coming up for air once I started eating Susan had 6 perogies and enjoyed We love this place They are planning to move in January or February to a new location in Mesa Fortunately they will be even closer to us :)We really need to take some of our kids there so they can sample some of this Scandinavian/Canadian cuisine Not cheap but you get what you pay for You can't find this stuff on Denny's menu (or any other local restaurant)Beaver Balls are next on my list to try.
2592,"I completely agree with the other review here  I legitimately thought it would be an Oktoberfest and not a San Tan Fest  If it's ONLY going to be San Tan beer and sub par food if not horribly done ""german food"" (bratwurst ONLY) then hold it at the end of September and call it something completely different  Omit Oktoberfest from the name because that was NOT an Oktoberfest  I will continue on with every other Oktoberfest in the state from now on as I now know the quality of the San Tan OktoberfestPS My boyfriend has been waiting to go to this Oktoberfest for 4 years and has not been able to go since he used to bartend weekends that caused him to be unable to go  PLUS his favorite beers on and off are the Devils Ale and the Hop Knot  I am not going to lie he was CRUSHED when he went to this event He had built this up to be at least a quarter of a typical Oktoberfest in his mind and it did not deliver at WHATSOEVER I will not subject him to this event again and when he said he'd rather go to the ballet he meant it  Try again San Tan."
1189,"Arranged for a ""small"" group of 22+ to meet for happy hour and great acoustic music  Not only did they graciously accommodate the group but the waitress Erin was able to give separate checks and constantly checked to see if everything was good and made sure that everyone was taken care of well  The food was great Something so simple as sliders were made to taste amazing with sauteed onions and pickles  The beer sampler was a huge hit and enjoyed by many in the group  This place knows how to make sure everyone leaves happy  The whole group was pleased and can't wait to go back  Thank you thank you thank you."
929,Bloody awful  Usually a decent experience but today my friend ordered an omelette but asked for it scrambled  It came out an omelette  We reminded outr waiter it was to be scrambled  No worries right  Simple miscommunication  He took it back into the kitchen marched right back out after they cut it up thinking we would not notice it was the same f*cking omelette  Frustrated and insulted we asked that it be taken off the bill and forgotten  She helped me finish my omelette  Waiter copped an attitude  Then while finishing up another waiter decided to refill out jelly serving tray WHILE we still sitting there  Couldn't wait 5 minutes pal   SheeshGood thing OHSO serves breakfast.
2960,Pattie'sI don't get it.
4509,"Stopped by for just a cocktail and to check the place out  The bartender was rude and short with us  After three attempts of trying to figure out what she was saying we got it  We didn't even get a chance to look at the menu as we couldn't finish our cocktails fast enough  There was not a very welcoming atmosphere apparently unless you are a regular and the ""smoking patio"" is a joke  Because of the non-welcoming atmosphere we won't be back."
1659,I love this place They offer a varied menu and the food is really good The soups are to-die-for A full bar and many TV's for sports A heated(or not ) outside dining WE go there at least once a week you can get a great meal at a very reasonable priceThey are also doing cork recycling one of the few that doA definite 5+++++ stars.
1380,I love Sephora  The associates are always friendly knowledgeable  and very helpful  They know the perfect colors for my skin type and for any occasion I am attending  They explain how to put on the product and what makes the product special  The products are expensive but they last for a very long time  I always get compliments on my make-up and I always buy from Sephora.
3223,Went in on a Sunday afternoon for dinner The place wasn't busy at all we sat at the bar After being handed menus 3 waiters including the bartender never took our order After sitting for over 10 minutes without one person taking our drink order a couple walked in and the bartender immediately made conversation and got their drinks They must be regulars because he knew what they wanted to drink We got up afterwards and left as waiters were gathered talking amongst themselves and didnt seem to care that customers were leaving We drove across the parking lot to Islands Burgers and was seated served and had our order put in within 8 minutes.
4890,Ok one star not because the food is bad not because the service is bad to be honest I have no idea I have never got that far I tried but the smell was so bad after a few minutes I was running for the door.
1379,I am a local and wanted something cool to do for my fiance's birthday and a friend recommended the Valley HoAnd I am glad she didWe stayed in the studio guest room she had a massage at HV Spa and we had dinner at Cafe Zuzu all of which were wonderfulOur room was huge private patio decent view comfortable bed and furniture Not only do you get shampoo bodywash the usual but even Qtips There are your standard water glasses as well as martini and wine glasses These little extra touches made it all the more enjoyable and worth the priceThe hotel is one of the coolest that I have ever stayed in It is in pristine condition everything is immaculate and sheik the decor and design is  a perfect combo of retro and modern that compliments the feel of the hotel The staff is helpful and out of their way friendlyIt is upscale without being pretentious trendy without being cheesy and an amazing experience that I would recommend to both visitors and locals alikeThe one negative is a $12 parking charge as other reviewers have mentioned.
3513,"We just had the worst dining experience since we have moved here at this place We had been regularly eating here about once a week and even recommended it to some friends however since we first starting frequenting this location the service and quality of food has been sliding downhill over time Tonight was the final straw so to speak we will not return After having to wait a ridiculous amount of the time while the manager got our table ready (It was not crowded at all and he could be seen back in the kitchen doing things) After a ten minute delay we were finally seated and we waited and after about five more minutes we were about to get up and leave when the manager came over to take our drink order About 7-10 minutes later a waitress finally came to the table to verify our drink and appetizer order (why) so we had to wait another couple minutes for our drinks (water) When the appetizer finally came my salad and my fiance's clam chowder were on the tray at which point the waitress asked if we wanted the two items with our appetizer We said yes because why would we want to wait when they have already been thawed and the waitress had already brought them It was another 10-15 minute wait till out entrees arrived and mine was not what I ordered I asked the waitress and she said ""Yes that is what you ordered"" then backtracked and said she would check with the kitchen Apparently the manager said it was okay to prepare me the proper order but I was not notified So after sitting and waiting another ten or fifteen minutes the waitress came by and asked if I had been told that they were preparing the correct dish I said no and she said it would be out soon The Manager never came by our table for I think he did not want to hear the complaints since it was obvious we were not happy especially after all the wait time Finally about 5 minutes after the waitress informed me that I would get the proper meal it came out and was obviously ""hurried"" We asked for the check and received yet another ten minute wait and when we looked at it I was appalled that we were given no discount whatsoever for the issues The Manager still never came by our table and would not even look in our direction This place is such a disappointment when we started eating there it was great well priced good service good quality The last 4-5 times we have been there it has been horrible and tonight was the worst I really do hope that the Owner/Managers see my review for they have lost our business and we ate there frequently and we will not continue to tell people to try it."
1963,Trendy hip good looking staff nice outdoor seating option clean  Great place to grab a bite with colleagues  Great people watching and the food is really enjoyable  Definitely get the pretzels and fondue and the dessert with Carmel popcorn is another must have  Fox restaurants are consistently very good  Pricing is ok and not obnoxiously expensive especially for being located at Scottsdale fashion square mall.
3452,We really wanted to find good Pizza in Gold Canyon butthis is not it Don't bother we just made an expensive mistake:-(.
931,Well let me just start out by saying that I am from the east coast and have used the same dentist my entire life until today  I had in impacted wisdom tooth that needed to be removed ASAP  I found Dr Poulos on the internet and read some review from other websites so I thought I would give him a shot  Wow was I taken back when I stepped foot in his office  I was greeted the moment I walked in the door and almost every staff member said hello and asked me how my day was going  The staff was all smiles and it seemed as if they really enjoyed their work environment  When it came time to crunch the numbers and see how expensive pulling just 1 wisdom tooth was going to be I was absolutely thrilled when I found out the cost was well under $400 per tooth (which is what I was quoted at about 10 other offices in scottsdale)  I explained to Dr Poulos that I did not have insurance and that cost was certainly an issue since I was paying out of pocket  He was very warm and friendly and did not try to up-sell anything I did not immediately need or want  I would highly recommend Dr Poulos and his entire staff to anybody that needs dentistry work done  He and his staff are extremely friendly outgoing helpful and very cheap  Give him a shot I have no doubt that he will impress you as much as he's impressed me.
4560,"Horrible  It's really a shame this is one of the few breakfast places in Ahwatukee  I've lived in Club West for 14 years and we were all SO excited for this placethat excitement quickly came to an end whenOn multipe occasions my running group on a date or just a casual lunch with my business associates I ended up saying ""I'll never come back"" The owners and staff treat their customers like they are fortunate to be dining in their facility  My experiences include:Burnt pancakes (really  who does this)Burnt coffee  (too lazy to make a fresh pot)Under cooked eggs when they were ordered over medium (yes your chef should know this)Rude servicePlan on being there for 2 hours to get served and recieve your foodOut of ""fish of the day"" by 6pm  Really order more next timeAnd to top it off I took my parents here once for dinner and the cook in the back choked up a lugie (yes the kitchen is part of the restaurant and you hear everything)SO grossThis time Hillside Spot - I won't be back."
3672,This place is so awful that I don't even want to spend too much time writing this reviewFood is mediocre service was extremely rude my catering order was never filled and when I called to confirm the order one hour prior to pickup they just simply told me they didn't make it and wasn't planning on doing ithuh  I once found a cooked cockroach in my dim sum dishthat was itwould never ever go back.
717,Great prices great selection and a very clean store Right in the heart of things to do in Scottsdale Love it.
2201,"My first time here for lunch I went with 2 other friends What we had:Appetizer: artichoke and spinach dip with tortilla chips Lunch: fish and chips and their special of the day meatballsWe got our appetizer and it was good The fish and chips were a little on the greasy side but what do you expect for fried fish and french fries The meatballs that's another story They used a spice in it that had a very strong licorice taste (I think the spice is called anise) There were 4 meatballs for $795 I took a small bite off of one and almost gagged I could not handle the licorice taste I asked if I can substitute it for fish and chips and make it ""to go"" as we were running out of time When the check came they did not take the meatballs off and asked the waitress about it Come to find out that the OWNER said ""JUST BECAUSE I DIDN'T LIKE IT I STILL HAD TO PAY FOR IT"" I WAS SHOCKED  I told her then I didn't want the fish and chips I only ordered a higher price item as not to walk out with only a $30 bill  We ended up leaving paying $46 $800 for the meatballs that I only had 1 bite out of It's a good thing I ate my share of the artichoke dip or I would have STARVEDI WILL NEVER BE COMING BACK HERE AGAIN."
2004,Funny there were more flys than customers in the Starbucks just a tad bit uncomfortable.
808,I contacted Todd at Harvest Design Group initially only to get a bid on a house we were purchasing in Phoenix and even with a very short time frame he managed to help me He is so kind and helpful i spoke to him personally on the phone  never a receptionist or a machine He knows what hes talking about and hes not out to steal all your money I HIGHLY recommend using Todd He well transform your backyard into a paradise.
3284,Well we wont be back again This place could be so cool but I don't really care for the menu and we have been unhappy with the food the last two times we have been and this last waitress sealed the deal for me The waitress we had this time seem to be in la la  land She forgot about comin back to take our dinner order after we ordered wings she couldn't seem to finish her sentences and really didn't seem to give a shit about us and she only had one other table The chicken sandwich is not the same as the one I had the first time This was a chicken breast with the fat still on it totally untrimmed Chicken fat in your mouth is the most disgusting thing ever Also the bread was hard and it was not cause it was toasted to much it had dried out from sitting out un covered Hard as a rock They tried to tell me it was toasted but lol there was  no color at all meaning not toasted not dark I hate being bull shitted people make mistakes so just admit it don't bull shit me ass hole I sent it back and did not get anything else If these cooks here cant prep a chicken breast then who knows what else there doin back there this is basics My girlfriend got the grilled cheese and mac n cheese Again bread not toasted totally white and cheese not really melted Um do these people know what a grilled cheese even is Unreal The bread was to thick for the amount of cheese Imagine two pieces of texas thick sliced bread and one slice of cheese lol this place is a joke The mac and cheese is watery and no flavor See ya Garage If you cant make a grilled cheese mac n cheese or a chicken sandwich that's even acceptable then forget it I guess if you have a burger and wings here you may be happy that's it.
586,I almost wasted $260 on an unneeded tire I brought in my car to fix a flat it had a nail in it After waiting almost an hour they told me it was unrepairable and tried to get me to buy a new tire They were originally purchased at Fletcher's so I brought it there instead hoping it was under warrantee To my surprise they fixed the flat with no problem and I was on my way in 30 minutes didn't have to spend a penny Sham on you discount for trying to take advantage of a lady.
1515,What a magnificent restaurant After four exceptional visits I decided it was time to show some love The food is a knockout the service is always friendly and attentive and the atmosphere is pitch-perfect I always feel like I'm at a great dinner party in the fabulous home of a great local chef Let's talk food:1 Cheese Curds - Basically the best fried things ever At $5 just get them and laugh at the idiots eating something by the same name at Culver's2 Brussel Sprouts - I can't remember the exact description but they were crazy good My boyfriend and I actually had to bargain for the last spoonful3 Stuffed Medjool Dates - That perfect melding of sweet/rich/spicy/salty I wanted more but I maintained my composure because the entree arrived as we ran out4 Pork Tenderloin - This was perfection Tender/perfectlycooked/juicy/flavorful/gorgeous grilled tenderloin I thought I'd had great pork but I was sorely mistaken The sweetness from the date butter was just unbelievable I've had my share of pork with some sort of apple concoction That's all fine and good but nothing has ever come close to this I can't wait to go back to have this dish again5 Chicken & Waffles - The ultra-crunchy breading on the most perfectly cooked piece of chicken ever As a boy from Kentucky I can't say that this was the best fried chicken of my life but it absolutely ranked among the greats (Actually I might give the crown to Arrogant Butcher on their fried chicken night) The white cheddar waffle is unlike anything I've had Crazy addictive and strange Highly recommended6 Ribs Special - So here is where I felt that I could have passed They were very good ribs but they weren't in the realm of Earth-shattering Although I am unfairly comparing them to the best joints in Memphis7 Bread Pudding - silent weeping with one hand raised to the heavens Praise8 Beet Chip Spinach Salad - What fun Just loved the balance flavors and textures Great salad to get for the table and shareThe thing about Tuck Shop is that they take a food that you think you know and they make it better than you thought it could ever be.
3076,Some of the worst customer service you will ever receive Do not go here unless it is an absolute emergency and even then try to find someplace else The worst the worst THE WORST There is ONE employee who is actually helpful an older gentleman no one else will feel compelled to help you at all DO NOT SHOP HERE.
312,Once again  the negative reviews by fellow yelpers  can be so lame Talk about first world problems here News flash: mexican food can be very unhealthy Especially tortilla chips that arrive to the table so piping hot that you have to wait for them to cool down before indulging Salty spicy hot warm crunchThe mol√© here is the only one that is as delicious as my mom's mole Seriously that good The margaritas are stiff and delish This place is here for the food not the service  though the service has always been great  This restaurant is one of the best of it's kind Major bonus: if you want to hear music play it on the jukebox Totally off the wall eclectic selection gotta love it.
3865,"Rediculous Was told there would be a 25 min wait which was hard with our special need twins but instead we waited over 45 minutes meanwhile 2 tops were walking in & being seated spoke to the ""manager"" who was rude & wasn't willing to put 2 tops together Needless to say their food might be good but who cares with that wait & attitude you can get breakfast anywhere."
83,This place is great food is great staff is greatBeen there several times and each visit everything is top notchSteak BBQ band serviceLove the view tooOh and yes don't forget the cotton candyOh and the boots boot mugs and boot shot glasses yes yesAnyone visiting Phoenix needs to see the view alsoI personally go back often and take visitors and Friends each time.
2811,You know it's pretty ignorant for the shop manager (travis Tyler whatever his name is) to argue with a potential customer when they call looking for some work doneI need a transmission cooler installed and he wants to argue that I don't need one and he has no idea about the vehicle I am inquiring about It's a well known fact that the particular Army vehicle that I won needs one if I am going to be towing anything substantial Also he has no idea how the internal to the radiator cooler performs that is already present (stock) and that it is pretty inefficientas  a cooler But he doesn't want to listen and wants to debate it Idiot My money will spend just as well at another shop Way to go bro.
999,I must admit - Paradise is a gem I purposefully forget how good this place is because I sometimes disdain $10+ lunches but when I go I always think it's worth it Turkey & Cranberry sandwich is one of my absolute favorites of all time SW Caesar Salad (add the corn salsa) is also very high on my favorite salad list This location is always clean and friendly Convenient access to the highway (and my office) means I should go more often as should you Wish they included a drink with some sort of lunch special under $10 In my dreams.
4959,Always a favorite spot last night the Cantina Laredo Fajita's for four were charged as if for 8 server couldn't fix the bill Then the meat was reheated cold meat since it was late It was a critically ill friends birthday - and I didnt not want to make a big deal Boycott.
4086,"The only haircuts they are willing to give are ""geometric"" I should have been warned because both the manager and the hairdresser had weird chopped-off blunt haircuts My hair is wavy and could not be forced into that kind of cut even if I wanted one I asked that it be layered and wound up with short hair in back and cocker spaniel ears hanging drooply beside my narrow face I went back to try to get it corrected and wound up with attempts at the salon specialty of geometrics It is the worst haircut I have ever had but I was forced to sign a statement that I was satisfied I am not but sort of got the impression I would be tangling with mall security if I refused."
3038,Ever since I moved out to Arizona from LA for school I was looking for a place that did nails well and was not overly priced I tried a couple different places and then I stumbled upon this place I love it the way they do my gel nails makes them last longer than any other place I have been too even in California It isn't super cheap the gel manicure is around $25-$30 but in comparison to some places I have been that is nothing I love this place and I wont go any where else.
3868,Food took way too long.
3300,I've stopped in twice during normal and was told they were currently not serving If third try is a charm we may never know.
1316,One of my favorite places to go Food is great and the patio is a nice place to hang out with friends.
422,This place is gross They did an okay job but the whole place smelled horrible and looked really dirty I don't know why the reviews are so high except for these people must have never gone to a clean nail salon.
966,Phenomenal Latin American fusion almejas al vapor are a must and the table side guacamole is some of the best I've had.
2251,I live right around the corner from this Fry's but much rather drive to the one on Baseline and 24th St The cashier here are anything BUT helpful and the lines are ALWAYS ridiculously long This store should just be shut down or some major customer service needs to be taught The store looks trashy and small Certainly does not have the look of a proper Fry's.
3374,We used to go this restaurant over two years ago and usually 2 to 3 times per week  The service at dinner time is bad bad bad  Poor management and only one waiter or waitress  We try to go back once or twice a year hoping it gets better  I enjoy the food and it is in the neighborhood  I can understand why they don't pack them in anymore  Seems like corporate would look at these reviews and make sure the service is brought up to par  Won't be returning for at least 2 more years  And that is probably only a MAYBE.
2120,"i was having a rough and stressful day and very hungry  i was craving chicken and only place near me  KFC what more is there to write about it says it all KFC  should i talk about rude employees should i talk about how dirty it was or maybe i should talk about how nasty the food it was ummmmm  well i was hungry and i was not planning to drive so i ordered grilled chicken  okay""sigh"" here is the problem i didn't care much about  rude customer service place being dirty or order took little longer than usual  but all i wanted was juicy tender grilled chicken with my hot sauce and wash it down with ice cold soda  am i asking too much here can a man take the time and enjoy his life a littlenah i was asking too muchchicken was soo dry it can pass for beef jerky come on now at this point i realized and understood why some people gone insane and start shooting i really wanted to throw my chicken at the staff who prep it  now i know why they call it KFC killed for chicken."
3607,"I've ordered carry out pizza at least a dozen times from this place  It has always been pretty good especially the crust  Tonight they screwed up the order which I didn't realize until I got home  When I called to let them know I was told the only way to make it right was for me to come back in for another pizza tonight  A guy that I assume is the manager told me he made what I ordered (not possible) they don't give credit and apparently just to be a smart ass told me they have buy on get one free on Monday but not today  I told him I won't be coming back and he said ""OK fine""."
3728,Meh It's Starbucks The coffee sucks the drinks are way overpriced for what they are and all the money goes to a corporationGo down the street and buy coffee from Copperstar and at the same time support the community you live in.
3784,We were disappointed with everything  The waiter was good  We ordered the  Roasted Garlic Plate for appetizer $10--very good but heavy  We decided to share an entree because we were so full after the app  We had the Soccoro Chicken which was not very southwesternmore Italian  The red pepper potatoes were flavorless as was the chicken This dish is way overpriced at $22 We each had a drink 1 wine 1 beer  The service was annoying  The water server kept coming to try to take our plates before we were done  This happened three times Then at the end of the meal while one of us was still eating she placed a dirty plate on our table then stacked one of our plates on it  Disgusting  The owner and servers continually troll the aisleit was disruptive as they passed the booths I know they are trying to be watchful of patrons in need  However with the girl who kept trying to take our plates it was annoying I told our waiter about the server's error in putting the used plate on our table and her over-eagerness in trying to take our plates Nothing was said to usWe are NOT going back.
1113,Went to Chuckbox yesterday with my dad hadn't been there since the early '90's when I was a student at ASU I don't think ANYTHING has changed there and that's a good thing Still the worlds best burger Although I can't handle a great big one as easily as I did back in the day I went to Smash Burger for the first time a few weeks ago and it's mighty good My dad and I decided we had to make a trek back to Chuckbox to decide who has the best burger We both agreed it's pretty much a tie Different tasting burgers VERY different environments both outstandingMy dad's comment was that Smashburger tastes 'corporate' and Chuckbox tastes homemade If I had guests from out of town we'd go to Chuckbox every time.
3198,Wow reading the other review guess waiting for your food to be served can be an issue at this restaurant  Try waiting an hour and 1/2  Other diners were so perturbed they left in frustration the intrepid restaurant staff then offered the departed diners plates to those still waiting for food - TACKY  By the time our food was served my mother in-laws hot beef was COLD  They supposedly were short 2 cooks Since they had a large group of women and a Red Hat society that seemed to get their food in good timing maybe the cooks walked out mid-shift  My husband wouldn't let me make a stink but after a wait that long with a hot dish being served cold there should have been an offer at comping a meal or taking a certain percentage off  How on earth does this place surviveSalsa was good shredded beef chimi I had was below average and over-fried  At least I know now if ever antiquing in Glendale again I can avoid this restaurantSo far the downtown Glendale restaurants I have tried have been sub-par and not worth trying again (Kimberly Ann's Tea Shop was the other).
4420,"Like a previous reviewer mentioned Chicken fingers are a staple item When you order them at a restaurant you know what to expect It's always at least a solid meal and sometimes it's a truly great oneSo it's kind of amazing to me that a place that sells ONLY that can screw it up so bad The chicken fingers have soggy weak breading that is devoid of any satisfying crunch that you can usually find on chicken fingers The actual taste of the fingers themselves is slightly ""off"" almost like the chicken is toeing the line of going bad The sauce (which if you don't order a meal you have to pay extra for) is some weird amalgamation of other sauces that work as chicken finger dips that ends up being off-putting and weirdly spice-flavored (you're better off with ketchup here as lame as that is) The texas toast despite looking like it's a step-up from something standard tastes like ordinary toasted bread In its defense it's the least offensive thing here And lastly the french fries something that many would compare to pizza in that even when they're bad they're still pretty good are genuinely pretty bad and some of the worst fast-food fries I've ever eaten They look like freezer-section Ore-Ida fries they taste like Ore-Ida fries and I would be pretty damn shocked if I found out that they weren't actually just Ore-Ida friesEating here was an awful experience but under some circumstances it could be salvaged I've had meals this bad before at restaurants where you had other options and later grown to love some of the alternative choices I've had meals this bad before at restaurants where the food was cheaper and enjoyed the fact that I could grab a bite on a budget But I've never had a meal this bad at a restaurant that ONLY sells the one item for such an un-appealing price I can't think of a single good thing to say about this place and can't imagine any reason why I would ever want to return here."
993,Terrible Debit card machine on pump never works And seriously it's 2013 quit charging for debit card use you stupid dinosaurs.
2271,I love Rosita's The food is awesome and the happy hour is fantastic I go at least once a week I highly recommend the spinach enchiladas and the shredded beef tacos.
4067,I went to Tandoori Times today for lunch with six of my co-workers for lunch It was not the best Indian food I've had but it was definitely not the worst (I had the achari lamb lunch special) But my experience there was horribleMy issue with Tandoori Times was the service Our waitress did not seem to care about our table at all even though we were the largest party in the place Maybe she felt that she did not need to work for her tip since it was automatically added to our bill She never checked on us to see if we needed anything One of our party members even had to chase her down just find out where his food was after everyone else's food had shown up 10 minutes beforeShe had issues with our check and stiffed us on our change I bill was $97 Three people put in $20 another a $10 and three people asked her to charge $17 a piece on their credit cards That totals $12100 We asked for change from the cash SHE CAME BACK WITH NO CHANGE AND WALKED AWAY As we were already 30 minutes late from lunch and were in a hurry we left but she swiped a $2400 tipEven though the food was good the service was the worst I think I've ever had I will not be returning to this restaurant any time soon.
1897,Best country bar in Scottsdale Also its a cool place to relax your mind from a busy day at work Also the band that plays on thursday nite to saturday nite is awesomechheeeeehaaaa.
541,Should have listened to the numerous negative reviews on-line (and there were many) but we trusted Guy from Diners Drivins & Dives BIG MISTAKE Clue 
930,Quick and fast food here Not the best.
2268,I used to go to this restaurant with a friend many years ago  I always loved their food  Tonight I was in the neighborhood and decided to give them a try to see if my memories were justified  They were  Though it was a quiet night the food was excellent  I was treated as an old friend and felt very comfortable  The ambiance is great  They have a small dining room with all sizes of tables  The tabletops are of brushed aluminum and are gorgeous  There is original art displayed on the walls all modern  Some of it is for sale  Upon entry there is a very nice divider that separates the dining room from view of the door  I ordered Sing Chow Rice Noodles and they were deliciousThis place is a little hard to find but don't hesitate to stop in for either lunch or dinner  You'll be glad you did.
962,Everything about TFK is awesome from the vibe to the drinks to the food This is one of the most unique concepts you will ever find The food is very healthy but so incredibly tasty I recommend the Turkey Burger.
3815,I had to pick up a bunch of things from Smart and Final today and I knew I wouldn't have any other time to stop for lunch so I walked into Papaya Thai to get a Pad Thai to goIt was about 11:45am when I walked in and there isn't a soul around and even though it's pushing 100 degrees outside somehow it's even hotter in here plus somehow humid and musty on top of it  If I was planning to eat in I would have left right then and thereSo I ring the bell they had on the counter (seems having no one up front is common) and a guy comes out and takes my order the Pad Thai lunch special to go  I go to Smart and Final and by the time I get my stuff loaded up my lunch is ready and I leaveI didn't pay particular attention to what the lunch special included but the only thing in the box beside the Pad Thai is a little sickly spring roll that was obviously bought premade frozen and fried off  It was innocuous enoughThe pad thai however was a different story  For some reason it was packed in a little tin foil pouch  While I had asked for a 35 out of 5 on the heat scale this was maybe a 2  No lime no real discernable flavor not even a pair of chopsticks in the bag  There was a little chicken in there and it was very tender but I suspect it is because of how thinly it is sliced rather than any cooking skillMost disturbingly there were these hard unchewable inedible pieces of something (egg shell) throughoutWould never ever go back  Especially when Beaver Choice an actual indie joint with some talent is just on the other side of the center.
4200,I went in to get a fill and called before to verify the price I was told it was only going to be 22 dollars After I was serviced they charged my card 40 dollars When I complained they said the fill was 17 and they charge and extra 20 for color I got French tip nails with no extra color or designs Do not go there Complete rip off and dishonest people.
3648,"This was the absolute worst place I have ever stayed Our ""Non smoking"" room reeked of cigarettes the TV had one channel the bed had NO blankets and it was incredibly noisy with what I suspect are drug addicts coming and going all night long The curtains in the room were 2 different lengths on the same window and I wouldn't walk barefoot on the carpet We paid $70 to stay at this dump Never again will I stay at any Travelodge Everything I brought into the room smelled and had to be washed If I hadn't been so tired after driving for hours I would have stayed elsewhere."
121,Have never had a problem with any service on the three cars I regularly bring in for service from my Honda Civic hatchback to Toyota Camry Sedan or even my Mercedes CLK500 They always have me covered at a fair price.
3458,"I've never been so disappointed in a veterinary visit  I brought my new puppy to this location to make sure he was healthy before I introduced him to my other dog He seemed to be having an ear issue and I let the veterinarian know All I was told was that his ears were too hairy to be able to tell ""but if I signed up for the healthcare plan"" they'd be able to do a test to see what was going on They were more concerned about selling me a year plan than my dog Not wanting to commit to a year plan with them they advised me to simply clean my dogs ears Now BOTH my dogs can't stop scratching their ears and I now have to pay for two visit to a different veterinary office and find out what they have going on in their ears I am so disappointed I waisted my money here and even more upset I now have two dogs that are suffering from their inability to fix the problem with my new puppy I will never spend aanother penny in this store and would advise anyone going to their veterinary clinic to choose an different location or completely avoid banner clinics."
2908,Took my car in this afternoon I have been having problems with pressure light coming on over the course of a year  I figured I might need new tires or have to patch one up  Either way I was feeling a bit anxious wondering what the cost was going to be  I brought my car in and I was surprised not only by quick service but everyone was friendly  One of the technicians did a walk around with me checked my pressure and told me they would check to find the source of the leak  In true auto body nature I expected them to find something anything just to sell me a set of tires or pay for services  WOW what a surprise they simply put air in my tires did an inspection and told me my tires were just fine NO CHARGE  The change in temperature was to blame for the pressure light coming on  WHAT  YOU ARE NOT trying to sell me something I don't need  You have no idea what it feels to walk away from a auto shop and feel that they are being honest  They now have a tire customer for life.
4639,THEY STILL CANNOT GET MY ORDER RIGHT Why is mcdonalds food like crack  Hate the service  but cannot stay away.
3980,I only give one star because they had decent meat We went at 2 PM and they had no salads we got our sandwiches and it was all just meat bread and cheese we will never be going back to this place again.
2347,My only regret with this place is that I worked neaby for years without knowing it was there  I'm a vegetarian and I love the variety with the wraps the soup and the sides  I've tried many different wraps and each one was great.
3692,This place a joke  It's pretty clear that they hired some fancy check to create their menu and then he has never touched the place since  We came here because I saw the WARM goat cheese salad on the menu  I'll get to that in a minute To start my husband's water glass had gobbs of lipstick all over it  Our server was actually quite friendly and she is the only thing about this place that deserves any stars  I ordered the warm goat cheese raspberry salad my friend ordered the caesar with dressing on the side and my husband got the quesadilla  The food came out surprisingly fast but it turns out that was because they forgot to cook it  The WARM goat cheese was breaded but ice cold  It had never even glanced at a heat source  And my salad was completely missing chicken  My friend's salad was slathered in dressing  Fortunately my husband's food was at least decent although he wasn't raving about it  We had to hunt down a random server because we couldn't find ours (she wasn't the person that brought our food) and it also took forever to get my drink refilled  She sent our food back and yet again it came back with cold goat cheese  The chicken was also cold and tough  I had just completely given up at this point and just ate it except the chicken which was tough and nasty  We also noticed that the table next to us received bread which looked quite wonderful but we didn't get any and would have loved to have some  I even made a comment about them not having bread We were completely disappointed and will never be back.
2187,Great  workout clothes for almost EVERY size I'm a bigger sized woman and they had my size I'm not shy about asking for the extra large as it is obvious so I was happy I could wear many many things here If you are 18/20 or 22/24 you can fit in to many things here So no worries Otherwise a majority of the clothes are made for a slimmer frameThe work out clothes have the 'wicking' fabric but in many styles and all are made with comfort in mind I am wearing some now lol  Great for running yoga etc  The woman who helped me at first was SO over the top it was ridiculous but she was very nice The young woman who cashed me out was just a lovely sweet personThey were very helpful and I was very very pleased with my purchasesThe sale items were great and a really good deal  TLDR: The store to go to for comfort quality workout clothes Over average price but not when you when you total the comfort style and quality of the product These clothes will last  There are great sales All the clothes feel like the person making them knew what a woman's wants and the shape of a woman.
171,Gelato is perfect - all the time Staff is incredibly friendly and remembers you (not sure if that's good or bad) Owned by some awesome people One time my husband brought home a flavor I didn't care for and when I sent feedback online the OWNER replied to me within an hour on a Saturday night and told me he agreed with me and they would retire the flavor immediately I cannot say enough good things and I will go to the Gelato Spot as long as I live in AZ nothing else compares.
2143,To die for food and the atmosphere is adorable Great date night.
1877,Omgosh best burger in town By far The milkshakes are to die for The atmosphere of the restaurant is great and the service was excellent I can't wait to come back.
2535,We've been coming here for years - and it has always been one of our very favorite places Perfect for a special night out - either for a romantic dinner or with friends  But tonight we discovered a new thing to love here at Pappadeaux: the chargrilled salmon diablo Perfectly prepared - and the flavors of the mesquite-grilled salmon were perfectly complemented by the slightly tangy diablo cream sauce with big tasty pieces of crab and crawfish in it Even the broccoli was delicious Steamed with a light sprinkling of garlic lemon olive oil and a touch of warm red pepper flakes Love.
3100,I wanted to like this place since it is so close to my house  Unfortunately I was completely unimpressed with the quality of the cupcakes  I bought a variety to try them out  First and foremost there is WAY WAY WAY too much frosting on these cupcakes  So much that it was gross - I like sweets but wow - this would put you in a diabetic coma even if you don't have diabetes  There was at least 4 times more frosting than cupcake   The actual cake is so small - like half a cupcake - and not very good  I have had better cupcakes from a box that I make at home  One of the cupcakes was also old and stale - it was the last one left of this flavor and I should have known better than to purchase it  The salesperson should NOT have sold this cupcake either and she had to have known it had been there a while - and she sold it to me anyway - I am sure just to get rid of it  I will say the marketing of GiGi's is very clever and the packaging and presentation is really cool as well - but I want to eat and enjoy a cupcake not just look at how pretty and cool it looks  Not worth $350 each and I will not be back.
4618,"This used to be the amazing Angel Sweet which I absolutely loved I have only been back one time since Gelato Spot took over and boy was that a mistake Like all the other reviewersI don't know if you can even call this Gelato anymore which is weird as I have been to their Scottsdale location and while not the best gelato it is worlds apart from what they sell at the Chandler spot The ""gelato"" was expensive the scoop size was small and the flavours were definitely lackingThey had a peanut butter and rasberry flavour that I sampled that I almost spit out Now for a guy whose nickname is Icecreamismylife there are not many types/flavours of ice cream that I do not like In fact I can only think of one time where I actually did spit out a sample That was when Cold Stone thought it would be a great idea to introduce a Wasabi flavour Well let me say that I actually believe that the Wasabi was better tasting than the pb&rasberry But I guess you can't really take my word for it I had another friend who thought it tasted like a pb&j So you can give it a try Just don't blame me if/when your gag reflex kicks inWith all of the other amazing ice cream parlors in Phoenix I can't see myself returning again to even give it another chance."
1749,I think this place is great especially since the new owners took overMaria and Albino are almost always around to greet you and they're warm and friendlyGood drink (GREAT MARGARITAS) and very good traditional food Big portions too for those of us getting tired a restaurants that treat Mexican food like it's nouvelle cuisineGreat placeThanks guys.
3018,Green is my absolute favorite place to eat on this earth You can't go wrong with anything you order off the menu It's all delicious from the wonderful appetizers to the amazing salads to the entrees with mock meat And don't leave without trying one of the scrumptious desserts Everything is priced very reasonably and that staff is always smiling and helpful I wish I could eat here every day Whether you're a vegan vegetarian or meat-lover try this place out You will NOT be disappointed.
899,I used AOA about a month ago for some group team building activities  I have to say I was very impressed from day one with the service they provided  Bernard was able to work with me on my time budget and activity needs to come up with 2 different activities for the group  We did the Team Orienteering and the comination of building a bike for charity & then a bike ride in the dessert  The Mountain biking activity was a HUGE hit the Team Orienteering wasn't a big hit but that wasn't the fault of AOAit just wasn't a good fit for my group  When I called Bernard a few days out to say that I needed to make sure my CEO had a hard bike ride he assured me Seth would take care of him  As is turned outSeth gave our CEO a private ride which he loved and talked about for the duration of the conferenceAOA had helpful friendly staff and excellent equipment  All the staff seemed to really be excited about what they do and helping out-of-towners enjoy themsleves  In the end our CEO was happy and the attendees really enjoyed themselveswhich made me happyI hope to be able to work with AOA again in the future.
731,Finally a grocery store in Scottsdale that isn't trying to rob me Don't get me wrong I like Safeway Albertson's and Basha's but come on what's with the sky high prices I like good food and variety but I don't wanna go broke either shopping for it Fresh & Easy was made for me THANK YOU for the discount sections.
490,Great food and friendly staff They have very good Vietnamese coffee I'll be going back soon.
1677,For reasons I don't fully understand I gave this place another shotalbeit my last try was in Phoenix  Well if nothing else they are consistently bad regardless of the localSo what's my beefFirst the table was filthynot dirtyfilthy  At fist we thought it was just sticky but as my wife wiped it down with a baby wipe it turned black with god knows whatNext we ordered coffe  Coffe and cream (milk actually) showed up and after we poured it into the coffe we found some sort of an orange substance in the cream pitcher   The waitress speculated it might have been crayon  CrayonreallyWe told the waitress we wanted to look at the menu for a few more minutes   Fifteen minutes later and she never came back  While we were waiting the wife took another baby wipe and wiped off the exterior of the coffe carafe  Well that was something that hadnt been through a dishwasher in quite a whileSo what to say here  Service bad  Cleanliness and this is in the parts of the restaurant you can see worse I can only imagine what's going on elsewhere  Food couldn't tell you  We never got that far but some how and based on my experience at the Phoenix location I'm well certain we didn't miss anything.
2854,Who wouldn't love a restaurant with great prices deep fuschia walls (yes) friendly service great food  and lots of parking (Hear that Los Reyes de la Torta)Upon reading Daren C's review I decided to try this place for lunch and had the pleasure of having Daren join me too I ordered the green chili burro lunch special The burro was huge had large chunks of tender beef and was nicely seasoned The rice that came with the meal was tasty and the beans - wow they're knock-your-socks-off good We tried asking the server how they got their beans to taste so extraordinarily smoky-good and all she could (or would) tell us was that they used a certain kind of Mexican seasoned oil Hmm culinary secrets are sometimes hard to pry out of people A great generous meal for $535 tax included So happy to have this gem in my neck o' the woods.
1983,Z's has by far the best chicken pita I have ever had  They are very generous with their serving sizes  Along with their great food The staff is super friendly  My time at Z's always leaves a smile on my face and a happy tummy.
882,"WELL Being the caffeine junkie that I am I feel that it is about time to review another Starbucks Went here a few hours ago picking up a hot latte to help me concentrate on prepping for a speech tomorrow (Those Vanilla Lattes really get the job done)Anyway Walked in said hello the employees who were all cheery and friendly Plenty of laughs and small talk which is nice I like that comforting small talk makes me feel like I'm not customer 456554 just  waiting for an overpriced latte I'm ""Wesley"" on that Venti cardboard cup and that's what I was called No sir's here Also wasn't too crowded yay Five whole stars for Starbucks PV Mall you guys earned it."
2198,Amazing chicken parm I was told by my Brother i need to try it I was hesitant at first because its a Japanese rest It is fantastic I have ordered it 2-3 times a week for past month I am as picky as they get with Italian food Good Italian food Was born and raised in NYC and found this to be some of the best chicken parm in AZ Portion is filling especially for $12.
2256,This place was awesome the base for the soup were awesome We got the combination and of hot and regular The hot was a little too hot for me but  I guess I could have asked for it mild to begin with The meat was soooo good the shrimp puffs were amazing We could not go wrong with the veggies and the mushrooms The green tea cheesecake was very good too The service was very attentive I feel sad that the place was not busy but I kind of understand it with the weather being so hot hot soup is not what one craves but once we were inside the place is cool and the food which is the most important thing was excellent.
319,Cheap prices with fast shipping and friendly phone service I happen to go through a LOT of toys due to my dog's need to rip out their entrails in 2 minutes or less Also I get his glucosamine supplements here for about 50% off what I was paying retail Awesome.
3095,"Perhaps if I were ""hammered"" I would have enjoyed this meal better I was sorely disappointed in this BBQ spot I ordered take-out on a Sunday and when I arrived I felt something was off right away The place was dead Not one person in the gigantic dining room only two people working there sitting at a table looking bored The bar however was pretty lively maybe I should have just sat down and had a beer instead of getting food Ribs - all char and fat barely any meat and extremely overcookedPulled pork - lacked flavor and came in a canister of greaseThe sides corn (half a cob is considered a side for two) Cheese grits worst I have ever tried dry and flavorlessCornbread - perhaps if it was used as a dry spongeBBQ Sauce - disappointing at best watered down and we were only given 2 tiny containers (like salsa sides)Peach Cobbler - canned peaches poured in to a container with a crumble on topI really don't like writing scathing reviews but  there was not one redeeming item in our meal There are tons of great BBQ joints in Phoenix this is not one."
4238,"This particular Cracker Barrel in Mesa is where I have had the worst dining experience of my life My sister and fiance are both servers and they were with me this day as well as a couple other friends We were seated right away in an empty back section of the restaurant I go to the bathroom and come back and my party is gone Our table was moved because oops No one's working that section of the restaurant It took over 20 minutes just to get our drink order taken We had a couple people stop by and say someone will be right with you someone will be right with you We finally had another server stop by and start to take our drink order People who had arrived after us were getting their drinks and salads already Since we'd been waiting forever at this point someone said can we just go ahead and order while we're at it And started placing their order By the time the waitress got around to the last person (my sister) she was very impatient Since my sister had some questions about the menu she started asking some polite questions (What comes with this dish Can I sub this for that) The waitress literally said ""Could you please hurry up I have other tables to wait on"" My sister sat there with her mouth open flabbergasted that someone would be that rude to her especially since we were getting crappy service already By the time the rude waitress (I think her name was Bobby) finally got our order in and it came out (forever later no refills on drinks) my order of 1/2 lb hamburger was wrong and I got a hamburger steak I think they just took it to the back and put a bun on it but I don't care I was hungry My fiance finally gets up to get a manager to explain the extremely lousy and rude service we received and we ended up getting the entire 5 meals comp'd I don't think we saw our ""actual"" server the entire time we were there The oddest thing about this whole thing is that the restaurant wasn't even busy They had sections closed off Our waitress had only 5 tables or so seated during the time we were there  We ended up tipping the hostess a couple bucks because she was the only person who competently (not that there's much competition here) did her job Too long didn't read version: If you go to this Cracker Barrel make sure you get a good server and if it starts to take more than 10 minutes to get your drink order taken you should consider leaving before you even start I recommend Logan's Roadhouse."
1745,What's not to love about Camelback Ranch I'm a Dodgers fan so of course I'm going to love it here Been coming here for the past 3 years for spring training Love the way it's set up and you get to see the players practice in the outer fields before the game starts (get there early) It's great because you get some great pics of the players Love the food Yummy lemonade Great seats anywhere and easy to get to It does get hot in Phoenix so we got up a couple times to stand under the shade Will be coming back for sure They have Dodger dogs :))) NOTE: Do not park in the dirt parking lot when you first come up on the ranch It is pretty far from the entry and when you leave at the end of the game you will be stuck in the parking lot for a LONG time Keep going down the street and you will find closer parking to the ranch Have fun.
1899,I love this place just noticed my review was removed Does anyone know where I can check that.
125,More of a tourist attraction  Food is better elsewhere for the cost.
922,I agree with everything that Max A said about this place  I went in here not too long ago as some friends really wanted to go for last call  If you are turned on by watching some pale anorexic looking girl wearing a gas mask dance on a bar then this place is for you  If you like bad hair white belts and crappy tattoos this is also right up your alley  I wanted to grab some of the girls in here and just give them sandwiches and some sunshine and tell them that their Daddy did love them  I won't be going back here its just depressing.
868,I've been here before and brought a friend for the first time raving about the place  He won't go back  We had very poor service  We ordered one appetizer one entree and one dessert and split the meal and it took over 2 hours  We watched other couples come and go and even when we asked we were told someone would be with us right away  We did have reservations also  The atmosphere is always lovely and the food was generally good but after having such poor service even the good food wouldn't win me over to come back again.
3299,"I've been here a few times as well as the location in Scottsdale Both are always tremendously busy which I can typically deal with I've tried a few things and really the veggie & house frittatas are the only things on the menu which I feel aren't overpriced for what you get but their food is good so this is - was - an occasional stop for me Today though after waiting at the counter for nearly 5 minutes someone finally came to take my order Only to refuse to make me the thing I wanted Yes you read that correctly He ""offered"" me something else from the menu because the frittatas apparently ""take to long to make and we're really slammed"" I was beyond stunned and left out of pure principle I can think of 9 other better ways to handle that situation Even worse I think the guy helping me was the manager (Here's an idea advise me that there will be a long wait offer me a complimentary drink maybe even bump an order or two ahead of mine so it doesn't cause a backup It wasn't like I was in a hurry - I even brought a book to hang out for a while) If an item on the menu is that much of an issue it shouldn't be on the menu I really hope owners peruse these reviews from time to time so they can address this sort of atrocious customer service Not that I'll ever be back to find out but they might like to know how their business is being handled."
4892,I used to love this place but lately I've been noticing that they have a bug problem Last time I was there I saw a roach looking type of bug scurrying up the wall My sister brought her visiting friend here and there was a bug on the plate of sushi When they told the server she looked at the bug and then squashed it with her finger on the plate This is highly disgusting It makes me wonder f there's bugs in the dining room what does the back kitchen look likeI really hate to give this place a bad review because they food was good prices are cheap and who can beat a $5 sake bomb But after these experiences with witnessing bugs I'm never going back.
1278,"Me and my girl went here last night for dinner and I had heard good things but was not sure what I was in for To my surprise when i stepped in through the large copper doors I was amazed This is a very nice place to eat It challenges any top tier steakhouse in the phoenix area and in my opinion beats them The reason is the value of the menu You get great cornbread and biscuits a relish plate soup or salad and a side of your choice included in the price Mastros Mortons and all the other greats are ala carte and here its all included and honestly i felt like i got a better steak I went with the prime rib dubbed ""best of the west"" and they were right It was one of if not the best I ever had My sweetheat had the combo oscar which had a small peice of salmon and a filet Everything was cooked to perfection the oscar sauce was deliciousso were the soups and salads Service was over the top and even though it was my first time there i felt like a regular Would I go backyou better believe it This place seemed to attract an older crowd but it was very nice and classyI can't understand why it  was not more crowed than it was After eating there i feel obligated to spread the word This is the best steakhouse in Phoenix Give it a chance and you will be pleasantly surprised  Eat up and enjoy."
384,A brilliant concept Fresh tasty food and drinks (and a yummy looking pastry bar) all while you get the best car wash of your cars life The wait for the car wash was well worth it and I happily passed the time while having a delicious lunch (crap cakes on mixed greens) and browsing the stores cute little market section I just moved to the neighborhood and this will be my regular spot.
739,Since this location is right down the street from our house we always go there We've never been disappointed with anything here and we absolutely love going Everything is so delicious even the Green-V It took me a while to try it but I'm glad I finally did so even their veggie juices are good :)Everything else of course is also delicious Our favourites include the Hummingbird Pomegranate Power and Caja Cooler We used to love Jamba Juice but now we can't go back there haha It's probably the employees and the owner though everyone is just so nice there and very helpful if you have any questions about any of the drinksKeep up the great work guys Definitely as good as it gets.
4083,Their prices don't match online prices and they never carry the shoes advertised on sale online in the store They also do not notify you if the shoes you ordered online were not sent I waited 2 weeks for a pair and finally went to the store to complain The employee told me there was nothing he could do and that I had to call the customer hotlinewow really Makes no sense to me isn't that part of your job Anyways turns out they were out of stock and were in the process of refunding my money but no email was sent I have to give this place 1 star My experience was just terrible.
946,Oh Z how do I love thee  Let me count the ways1 LOVE your margaritas  Seriously  I'm not a fan of tequila and/or margaritas generally speaking but I love Z's margaritas  Especially the Chambord and Prickly Pear   Be warned though - they're VERY dangerous2 SALSA  I love it  They also have an appetizer with a variety of 3 salsas but honestly their original is the best  The chips are good too - light and crispy3 EVERYTHING on the menu  Not kidding  I haven't had anything I didn't like at Z  My faves include: catfish tacos Jerk Chicken salad Diablo Pasta Wild Mushroom enchiladas Mac & Cheese w/o bacon the trout seriously the list could go on and onMy mouth is watering  I think you get the point  Go to Z  ASAP.
3485,I ate at BLD tonight which was the first time in awhile to eat there and I know it's going to be a long while until I eat there again The WORSE service I have ever had Not only was the table I was at getting bad service I noticed the four other tables in the restaurant were getting just as neglected Our waitress seemed too busy making herself a cappuccino and leaning against the bar to talk to the bar guest than it was to refill myself and guests drink for 45 minutes We had empty drinks throughout the whole dinner up until we left because she would not refill them She never came by to quality check the food either or even just a walk by I heard another table complaining about the service as well She concluded the dinner by slamming the check down on the table and continue walking There was no manager in sight for us to talk to Overall it was the worse dining experience ever The food is good but that does not outweigh the horrible service I recommend going somewhere else with the whole package.
207,Money doesn't grow on trees but Dollar tree grows on savingAlthough one may be embarrassed to go into a discount store you'll miss out on some very cool items or only a dollar  Things that you would normally buy at Walmart or Target you can get it here for a fraction of the price  In this economy quality dollar items are hard to find but at least here you'll find something that may surprise you and stretch out your budget  Staff are friendly and place is clean Also the company seems to do a lot of community projects as well which is pleasantly surprising for a discount store.
2892,I'm a big fan of California Pizza Kitchen They have many great menu options--just don't be on a low-carb diet Their pizzas salads and sandwiches are all good from my previous experiences As for this location in particular expect a bit of a wait Friday-Sunday as this is a popular and centrally located location I've found the service here to be good but not always consistent I frequent this restaurant a lot and while the service is always acceptable and almost always excellent there have been a couple isolated incidences where I feel the service could be a little better.
2899,Love this F&E location  It is always clean staff is always friendly and the food is always great looking  The fact that they offer organics local brands as well as your typical Kraft Mac and Cheese boxes is a huge bonus  This makes it higher on my list than Sprouts or Trader Joe location since they don't carry mainstream brands alongside their local selections  I like that I can find Charmin toilet paper organic veggies and ready made meals all in one place.
116,Want experience the perfect evening with friends in old Scottsdale - go here and nowhere else  This place has it together on every category Service ambiance drinks presentation deserts etc Everything we ordered was very creative fun and fresh Not a cheap date but treat yourself to this one.
1455,The Sunday concerts in the park are chillin' Our group dons blinky lights and glow sticks and sits in chairs and on blankets on the far end of the park to the right of the stageThe park itself is well groomed and beautiful One of these days I will take the train ride around the park just becauseThe park is leashed dog-friendly Peekaboo experienced her first rabbit in the parkBring a blanket and a cooler and come join us for a Sunday evening in the park jammin' to some awesome tunes.
1226,I was a bit sad since I used to frequent the Uncle Sam's that was here but all my regrets are definitely gone Portillo's is a sick joint and I hope it's here to stayTaking down the restaurant decor for a very open counter service restaurant Akin to something like Five Guys you can view the entire line of cooks from grill to tray service along half the perimeter They even have a separate counter for serving desserts The title suggests hot dogs is the main attraction but from what everyone's been ordering and what the staff tells me the Italian beef attracts the most customers The gravy is excellent and the beef while succelent embodied all the classic flavors every Italian beef fan loves The bread does the sandwich justice but it's good but not great I personally like the combo which comes with an entire sausage in addition to the beefThe sides are not something to shirk at either The onion rings are super crispy and the crinkle fries work well with dat cheese whiz To top everything off this entire restaurant even has a drive thru which totally worksThe menu is huge so I'm far from exhausting my limit here I hear the salads are pretty good and I've got to try the namesake dish eventually However it's really hard to stay away from the Italian beef every time I come back.
4169,I LOVE the concept  It's close by  The owner is a nice guy  But there's a huge problem here as others have opined - the burgers are HORRIBLE  The bun is disgusting (if you can't even get the bun right that's pretty sad) and the fried burger patty is bland fatty greasy and not the least bit appetizing  The fries are OK helped taste-wise by the fact they're cooked in lard  But they're nothing to write home about  Everything else is all about the gimmick beer booze broads cigarettes  The burgers are EXPENSIVE  Sorry but I just can't come back  If the burgers were even half-decent I think this place would be a huge success  But they're not and I'd bet that repeat business is not nearly what it could be.
3052,"Smashburger has just recently opened and is a quantum upgrade over the restaurant that used to occupy that space I thought I would brave the Friday lunch crowd and try this newly opened restaurant today I got there right before the line started forming 20 deepI had a regular smashburger on an egg bun (without cheese) and a drink for $665 My burger was adorned with mustard sweet relish grilled onions tomatoes and regular red onions (I didn't ask for the red onion but it was good) The food runner even commented on how good that burger looked Well you know what it was Awesome They even have people circling aroung topping off your drinks My only complaint is that they didn't serve the drinks in the ""to go"" cups I promise to bring back my ""restaurant glass"" the next time I visit."
334,"Shannen at NextAesthetics is the absolute best Aesthetician ever  I have received facials for many years and from Shannen for the past five years  Shannen's facials by far exceed all others  Through her customized facials superior product and ""magic"" hands my face looks and feels the best it ever has  Shannen is constantly learning new technologies and treatments Next Aesthetics offers  Everyone in the NextAesthetics office is professional knowledgable and friendly and I highly recommend NextAesthetics for cosmetic treatments."
301,They should rename the Genius Bar to the Halfwit Bar  Seriously they throw Genius around way too liberally  Google yields more helpful information than the simple condescending clowns  Scottsdale Quarter is offering upI love Macs but don't waste your time at Scottsdale Quarter  They have had to replace two of their $5000 giant glass doors already because they piss people off so much.
4861,"I went to The Carwasher this morning to have my 2 month old BMW 650 cleaned and had a very unpleasant experience I arrived and was greeted in the following way ""what's up boss"" I would not regard this as a professional greeting but I am willing to look past it I proceeded to purchase the more expensive of two wash options they offered for $1199 which was considered ""full service"" I went through the tunnel and continued to the area where they hand dry and do a basic ""detail"" After 5 minutes of their ""once over"" on the car the manager called out ""HEY"" to let me know the car was done again sub par professionalism The car was still dripping wet with no armor all on the tires or utilization of the air hose to remove the water from the door jams etc I said to the manager ""are you sure you are done last time I was here they applied armor all and dried the car completely"" He said can you usually get armor all applied for just $1199 at other car washes"" By this time I was sensing his sarcastic arrogance and replied ""well 3 months ago I came here and received that service level and it was $400 cheaper at $799 and unless your armor all cost has increased by greater than $400 per car I would expect the same now does that make sense to you"" His response was ""we are going to do you a favor and apply the armor all this time"" He followed up by saying there were upgrade options above the ""full service"" level (that I was never made aware of at purchase by the way) that include armor all etc and I only got the ""basic service"" I then proceeded to point to the roadside sign that clearly depicts ""full service"" - $1199 ""basic service"" - $599 showed him my receipt that says ""full service"" and finally he was speechless Customer service is paramount in this tough economy where competition is fierce between companies it would be in your best interest to address these staffing concerns before you lose additional customers to the competition Bottom line if you are going to charge top dollar for a car wash make sure you are at least offering a parallel service as your competitors I will NOT be coming back here again as a result of their lack of customer appreciation and abusive customer treatment."
2164,Not sure why today was better than all the other times I always remember johnny rockets in cali having terrible service Pretty damn good.
788,Do not eat sushi here The service was good the bartender was pleasant but the fish was terrible We ordered tuna and salmon nigiri which was completely dried out and in a word disgusting I have to assume the other reviews refer to the wok menu because the sushi was a health code violation waiting to happen.
2202,This is one of the best Borders locations I've been to It is located in Biltmore Fashion Park facing Camelback The store is two stories and has a huge selection of books magazines DVD's and other things I have yet to find a Borders in NE Ohio that compares to this Seattle's Best Coffee serves great latte's and snacks It may be soulless but it's a great store nonetheless Overall if you need a book or want to spend some time in a Phoenix area bookstore head over to Biltmore Fashion Park and stop in at Borders.
3803,"I decided to try the new ice place ""Scooptacular"" Let me say this was not a good experience I wasted my time and money First the customer service was the worst Sorry to say it Jennifer but I repeated my order four times Wow and the order was still wrongThere are only a few regular flavors Can you believe no regular vanilla ice creamTwo sundaes cost $864 which is ridiculus considering the size of this sundae was a six ounce plastic glass The whip cream was not sweet I don't think it was real The hot fudge was the only good thing on the sundae and it was scarce Oh and by the way used spoons should never be next to clean utensils I almost picked up a used oneDon't waste your time Although I support local businesses this one needs lots of work."
2596,Went here with a friend who has been raving about this place for awhile When we pulled up I was a bit skeptical by the concrete building but the shop is very clean and cute inside The cookies are all slightly crisp on the outside and soft on the inside - they're amazing I got a peanut butter and double chocolate The chocolate was probably the best chocolate cookie I've ever had I also bought a carrot cake cupcake with cream cheese frosting The frosting was delicious and the cupcake was very moist - I usually throw away the cake part after eating the frosting but I actually wanted to eat the whole thing.
2517,"Funny how a small theater that shows mostly independent films could draw such a crowdWent last Sunday to see ""Milk"" with Julia and Ayesha  I ran into the bartender from Harley's in line  Then saw our own Amanda with her little girl outside tooThe line was a bit long butOMG an electronic ticket machine  Went straight for it with my debit in hand got my ticket in less than 2 minutes  The staff at the concession stand was awesome  They were really funny and you could tell that they loved their jobThe theater itself was nice  Not stadium seats which all the big theaters have  We got seats close to the front because it was *that* crowded and there were 3 of us  Try finding 3 seats together on a Sunday afternoon  Seats were comfortable  Even though it's an older theater there were still slots in the armrests for your drink  This will definitely be my first choice despite it being at Fashion Square  I prefer independent films sometimes and this place was the top banana."
619,Cafe Laguna is a great place to go for a delicious mexican fix  The Indian tacos are my absolute favorite  I always order the grilled chicken Indian taco  The chicken is tender and moist the vegetables are fresh your choice of beans  It is absolutely mouthwatering  We moved to Tucson recently and everytime we visit Mesa we make a stop and Cafe Laguna  We've even made trips to Mesa just to get an Indian taco (honestly they are THAT good)  they aren't your typical tacos the frybread adds a new twist to the traditional taco that just makes you feel like you died and gone to flavor heaven  It's chewy texture added with the crisp lettuce tender meat and spicy pico de gallo makes an absolutely perfect combination  If you haven't tried it make it a priority on your bucket list trust me you will go back  I hear everyone posting how it is like Chipotle this place blows Chipotle out of the water  Good luck and good eats.
3077,First of all great produce delicious fresh and a great selection Thinking about them makes me hungrySecondly ease of ordering starting service and changing orders -- their web site is easy to useThirdly great attitude superb customer service  Highly recommended.
4475,"I wish I would have read these reviews before going to Dee's I have always gone to Barry's Capezio in Scottsdale for the past 14 years and decided to go to Dee's because they can put taps on the shoes right in the store Wellbig mistake The taps were uneven on each shoe and I felt a screw inside My director/choreographer (who I sent there to buy his taps) told me to bring them back for an adjustment So I dropped them off  and when I came back I still felt a screw inside the shoe And so did the girl who worked there They said I had to call the owner in the morning So I left the shoes there again and called the next morning and I was being very nice and apologetic because I knew his dad was ill Here I was apologizing for not being satisfied and instead of saying he's sorry I had to come back 3 times he yelled at me saying 'I don't have time for this"" and hung up So I went to pick them up after work and I got home and tried them on I still feel the screw and the right shoe doesn't tap when I tap the front of my foot I had just spent almost 30000 there within 5 days on another pair of dance shoes as well Block split sole characters for almost 100 bucks plus i sent a bunch of others to buy their items for our production We will NEVER go back I don't know what to do now I can't tap in these Maybe I'll see what Barry's Capezio says All this money wasted."
317,Great place to shop  kind of expensive but you get what you pay for Alot of organic stuff here ~.
2117,My wife made us go here--right smack across the street from ASU  Sooocash only place-fine we knew this  Best flame grilled juicy burgers ever  My wife can't have beef so she had chicken breast--lovied it  My burger was the best everand the toppings buffet was ice cold and the burger toppings all well chilled  Just awesome  Left very very satisfied and happy she made us go  Will DEF be back :).
2035,I eat at this place all the time when my family is hungry and for something fast I'm not going back and I don't recommend to anyone We went there tonight with our kids for there 50 cent cones and play in there new play area The kids ran into the play room to play while my husband and I went to the counter to order Barely anyone inside and no one at counter by us There was only one female in grey uniform who had head phones on came up to counter my husband said hello and she did not give us the time of day took a cookie and walked back to kitchen We stood there for another 10 mins and no one came up to us and said anything We took our kids out of play area and went to McDonalds down the street I will never go back and I hope they fire the lady due to her poor customer service.
1249,Food is good but had a gift card and apparently they are location specific gift cards very stupid u offer gift cards they should be good at all your locations even if they are independently owned and operated.
1713,"ok finally went back to roka last night and im speechless im not sure if it was the amazing service by the GM Joy or one of the greatest servers ive ever had Casey  They sat us in a small table in the back corner which was great  When i came in i knew everything i wanted to order but that soon changed after casey started to tell me about their specials  We ordered the rock shrimp tempura which is half the price as what we are used to  paying at NOBU in LA and 10000 times better here at roka  Next came this scallop flamed seared with king crab avocado and who knows what else see the pictures every bite was pure happiness   Casey helped us to decide on some great sashimi selections  The salmon sashimi there is out of this world its hard to explain that a piece of fish in the AZ desert is fresher than anything ive ever had in LA or NYC But it was  then came our steak i wish we had went for the a3 waygu but my GF decided to only have the filet  Here again who would believe that steak at roka akor is BETTER than at masteros or Morton's  The steak melts in your mouth its unbelievable  Im not a big fan of desert but this huge desert platter was served for my GFs birthday  And im sure i was eating what other reviewers called the ""snozberry"" i hate coconut everything but found myself eating it all i couldn't stop  January is Steak month at roka so we will be back shortly and if i can ever find the time i would love to do the sushi classes  Bottom line thank you Joy for changing our minds and if you want a server who will give even the best foodies a run of their knowledge ask for CASEY  OH and anyone who complains about the price get real this is some of the best food you will have and the prices are 1/3 what you will pay in LA or NYC with food that is out of this world delicious."
1560,Wow this dinner was pretty spectacular I've never had an experience quite like it So you start with a lovely salad bar they had butter lettuce (yessss) and a delicious basil dressing that went great with my tomato slices There were also a variety of cheeses available and smoked salmon yumNow lets get down to the meat There was a Picanha (the prime part of the sirloin) which was gorgeous Filet Mignon Beef Ancho Lombo (pork loin filets encrusted with parmesan cheese) Frango chicken wrapped in baconyay Linguica (slow-roasted pork sausages) and my favorite Cordeiro the leg of lamb moist and deliciousThis is a great concept for a restaurant I can't wait to bring my husband for his birthday.
4545,Rental car review118 degrees  Standing outside in the heat waiting for a bus  10 minutes go by and I have seen 3 busses leave with out of service signs  Another 10 minutes pass and no active duty busses  Finally a bus  We have a packed bus and the driver is just standing outside  5 minutes later he comes back on the bus and we drive 10 miles an hour the whole way to the terminalPHXpay attention  Business travelers do not appreciate being left in the heat for 20 minutes watching out of service busses pass by.
2157,We went here for dinner last night and it was so amazing that here I am  first thing in the morning writing my review In a word Posh is AMAZING So much so that I can't wait to go back  Sorry Mark and Eddie but I think I just found my new favorite place Oh I'll be back to you but holy cow is Posh ever good As has been described already in other reviews you get a list of proteins and you can let the chefs know what you dislike and they will build a menu based on what you do like I pretty much gave them carte blanche although husband was a bit more restrictive We opted for the full tasting menu his without wine pairing and mine included wine The service is absolutely incredible Everyone is very friendly and non-intrusive although with selecting the full tasting menu we saw A LOT of our server  Several times Joshua Hebert the chef/owner served our dinners and he is a delight--very sweet humble and a refreshing change from some of the pompously overbearing chefs here in town (cough cough Chris Gross cough cough)The food was fantasticsimply utterly completely fantastic With the full tasting menu there were 14 (no that's not a typo) different selections that came to our table including dessert I included the foie gras and while others disliked the pairing of it with the berries I found it quite a nice compliment to the richness of the foie gras Each selection came just as we requested it be prepared full of flavor and never over done  Our dishes truly crossed the entire spectrum of food ranging from fish to clams to beef short ribs to sweet breads venison duck lamb and beef  We had the most delicious endive salad which was a homage to the wedge salad only bite size And we also had an amazing sweet potato soup that was velvety and perfectly done The only dish I didn't care for was the duck as the texture just didn't do it for me Husband likes his meats prepared well done and he got well done every single time--not burnt--but still moist and delicious Since I selected to have wine pairing each dish came with a different wineso yeah that's 14 different wineswell 13 because 1 dish was actually paired with a very nice beer Each beverage was perfectly paired with each dish Having the pairing did enhance the flavors of each dish But I guess that my 1 complaint14 alcoholic beverages paired with 14 dishes and this Mama was definitely drunk by the time we got outta there  By the last 4 dishes  my tastebuds were so inebriated I don't think I quite got the full flavor of those dishes I can tell you that those last 4 dishes had great textures and I'm pretty comfortable to say I liked them  The dessert of crustless cheesecake with meringues was refreshing because it wasn't so sweet (at least I think so haha)  The next time I go back I will probably just order a bottle of a solid all-around kind of wine instead of doing pairing simple because I don't want to be drunk every time I go there The only other complaint I have is that the restaurant gets very very loud The room is a wide open space with nothing to break up the noise And be prepared for the obligatory arrogant Scottsdale guy who thinks he's far more important than he is out with a woman who is so out of his league that he doesn't realize she's just there for his money There were a few of those but it does make for great people watching If you are looking for something differentsomething where you can just tell the chef this is what I don't like now SURPRISE ME Posh is your place I can't say enough great things about this place and I really can't wait to go back.
3576,Terrible experience in Swaddee  I found an used bandage in the food  So yakkk  The waitress came and grabbed the dish away  I should've take a picture about it She apologized for the incident  But my friends and I had to leave  I will never go to the place again.
721,"What a gem Any beer lover MUST go to Sun Devil My life would be a better place if I had this place closer to my home but alas I only make it to Mesa once a year DO NOT PASS UP the opportunity to go to the bar in the basement- an absolutely BRILLIANT use of a space which could have been simply storage but now hosts a beautiful bar with room after room of over sized and ridiculously comfortable furniture in a cool (as in ""escape the AZ heat"") and relaxing environmentI have to say it again- if you like beer- go to Sun Devil- the selection is truly mind boggling  Oh and PS- they have a drive thoughfreaking awesome."
4857,We travel a lot and Total Wine is always one of our first stops when we get where we are going Every other Total Wine in all other locations 5 star I would give this one -5 if I could Not only is it small over crowded dusty and has boxes in the aisles there is no one to help you find anything in the crammed together mess when you do find someone they are clueless about their products The registers always seem to have people training and thee trainers are often rude to the customer and downright mean to the trainees  On one of our trips over Christmas my 70 year old husband was refused his purchase because he didn't take his wallet just took some cash and couldn't prove he was of age to purchase alcohol I am dead serious We travel to Scottsdale every few weeks to visit our kids Fry's will be our soul provider of wine beer and spirits from this last trip forward By the way the favorite all time Total Wine to date St Pete FL.
3178,I'm usually a fan of the prices and the food variety but when I was walking down the aisle today a mouse ran next to me and hid under some shelves Yes a mouse I tried to take a picture of it but it was too quick Now this place kinda grosses me out.
1339,Of course a 5 Star I have my Arin I know I can always run into and share some killer MAC N CHEESE with and a bottle of Chambord Love this place.
904,If you like inattentive service than this joint is for you You want your burger to look like it got into a brawl in the back than this joint is for youYou want to wait  10 minutes after you sit down for your drink order to be taken then this joint is for youOh no run away then and hope the other resturants opening up in terminal 4 open soon.
1240,This place is awesome The tea is way better than Starbucks and the coffee doesn't taste burnt The manager Debbie is almost always there and is always very friendly and accommodating I recommend the southern iced tea It tastes like rose pedals with just a very slight sweetness.
2254,I'm a sucker for Chicago food from back home but out here in the valley and Higley Hot Dog has been there for a while providing authentic Vienna Beef Hot Dogs since I went to ASU east campusVery home town feel the older couple that owns/runs it are always very nice and happy and having a good time  And the lunch line there gets long and out the door cause it's so good :)Notes:  Not open on Sundays and CASH onlyThe MAP on yelp is/was wrong here's the correct business profile link on Google Maps - http://isgd/fn6UThey have some good press already as well:http://wwweastvalleytribunecom/story/123004http://wwwinsiderpagescom/b/3657327340.
1360,What a great local spot Have been here several times and have never been disappointed Took a good friend here from out of town a few weeks ago and he still goes on how great the burger was and how awesome the prices are  Make a visit you won't be disappointed  Waiter also told me that the patio is dog friendlywhich I will try when the weather gets better.
995,The people at Glenfair Veterinary Hospital are fantastic The price for any service here is easily one-third of anywhere else and the service you receive is genuine They truly care about your pets and you can feel it the minute you walk in the door I live in East Phoenix but I'll drive the 30 minutes to give Glenfair my business.
568,Thank you Thank you Thank you  My bassett hound got out of my yard down the street from taco bell and they were very nice to take my business card and let me know if he by chance would show up theregot home after going through the window and sans de bassett patron saint of speed bumps was wandering up the drive way into my yardcalled taco bell to thank them for caring  And I got a sweet burro to boot.
4979,I was at the Pointe Hilton Squaw Peak Resort for a conference and I had paid for a booth in the Hohokam Ballroom for three days During my stay my boothmate and I began receiving huge red itchy welts which were bug bites from insects in the ballroom I went to the concierge who took me into the business center to speak with the manager Kyle King who apologized and said he would immediately come down to the ballroom to assess the situation Unfortunately nobody ever came to deal with the insect problem and we continued to receive bites and ended up with around a dozen bites each from our feet up to our knees The bites were so itchy that they kept us both up at night for a week even while constantly applying medication I later spoke with a nurse who said that they appeared to be flea bites and that the hotel needed to take action with the problem since flea bites can become infected from the feces fleas leave while on our skin and if they are scratched can lead to scarringAfter the event I called the Pointe Hilton Squaw Peak Resort and asked to speak to a manager about this issue Nobody would connect me to a manager and asked why I needed to speak to a manager in the first place I explained what had happened during my stay on the property and was told they would find the manager Kyle King I had spoken with and connect me to him I was put on hold for more than ten minutes and then was told I was going to be connected to the Director of Security who told me he would get Kyle King's contact information and call me back with that information so I could e-mail photographs of the bug bites I received from my stay on the property The Director of Security called me back and said his boss wouldn't allow him to give me a managers contact informationAfter this I e-mailed the resort and was told that since I didn't pay to stay in a hotel room and only paid to stay in the Hohokam Ballroom that they couldn't do anything about it even though this happened on their property and they did nothing about it And speaking of rooms I later was informed that some individuals that stayed in hotel rooms on the property during the same time had issues with ants swarming in their rooms which ended up getting into their luggageOverall I think it is ridiculous that the hotel wouldn't do anything about the bugs and also that nobody would let me speak to a manager when I had a complaint I expected a clean and safe environment to be in at the resort but the resort has bug problems in several different areas which need to be attended to for the safety and health of the guests.
3078,Oh Rhythm Room how I adore theeI have seen some of the greatest Blues legends play here and have never been disappointed   Whenever The Rhythm Room All-stars play I definitely try to make it  They are rockin'  I dig the dancing the bbq (mmmmmm)  and I enjoy when the f*ck the police guy is roller skating on the dance floorI do recommend getting there early if you want a table and a chair  For bands I really want to see I get there before they open get in line get a table then someone in my party goes to grab us some bbq and we start drinking and eating and waiting for the music to start  I always have a great time here  And now that you can't smoke it's even better.
4331,This is a bad StarbucksIn 15 years of drinking Starbucks in hundreds of locations in as many cities I have not found a worse run Starbucks consistentlyMy office is near and I have resorted to going out of my way to get my Starbucks at a different location  Unfreindly inefficient unqualified and just horribly managedAmateur employees who play grab @ss with the others while they are serving you the wrong order while the line is dozens deep is frustrating  Dirty condiment stations ALWAYS and usually out of something until you tell them  If it were one or two experiences I would never write the bad review but it is every time  So frustratingI have written Starbucks corporate several times they have acknolwledged the problem but obviously done anything to fix it  It is a shame and a black mark on a good corporation.
2978,Horrible service almost an hour to get our food  NO discount on our food but yet the manager had no problem sitting at the counter eating his pot roast  Not once came by to apologize or comp food  Complained to corporate office and got a generic all purpsoe email  Umm yeah about the $25 I blew for bad service cold food and attitude  I was starting to turn my attitude about Denny's thinking they were doing better but they proved they aren't  THings happen but when the corporate office can't even call to apologize that is saying we don't care.
2865,"I told my friend that I'd rather eat out of a vending machine and he said ""Yelp THAT""   I had the calamari app the caprese salad and the eggplant rolotini  The salad was served in what i can only describe as a burnt upside-down bread ""hat"" that was inedible and in the way  The rolotini was a hot pocket only dry and crappy  Boo on you Crust."
2531,"Truly an amazing meal  Great space open kitchen is very entertaining  Sincere warm friendly service  And outstanding foodThe chicken is phenomenal - perfect example of how a humble dish can excel with great execution  Someone in your party has to order it  The lamb was similarly terrific  The braised leeks are well covered in other reviews here and are a great choice but the fennel was even better - the ratio of various ingredients perfectly balanced and with just the right amount of dressingIf you consider yourself a ""foodie"" - or whatever annoying term we use to describe ourselves - you owe yourself a trip to FnB  This is a restaurant that could thrive in any market in the country - Phoenicians be thankful it is in your hood."
2119,Today I went to this location as well as the location at Arizona Ave to pick up school supplies for my kids  THIS location was very well staffed and I was easily asked 3-4 times if I was finding everything I needed or if I needed any help  Really great service and the place was very well organized - yes I was finding everything I needed everything that was in the back-to-school ad  Prices were comparable and often cheaper than Walmart next door  A successful back-to-school shopping experience especially with the $5 off a $30 purchase coupon teacher's discount and $2 per old binder discount when buying a new binder.
2311,This is definitely the best Indian restaurant in Phoenix The tandoori chicken and aloo tikki wraps are to die for You cannot go wrong with this place.
3046,This customer service line can't get any longer Four registers and one worker really Ive been in line for almost forty five minutes and still haven't been helped Ahhhh This place is so frustrating.
1959,We were *that* family that brought a cranky toddler and a picky 9 year old to a fine steak house and Fleming's survived with style and grace and an excellent sense of humor  We enjoyed every item on their happy hour menu as well as a pile of cocktails and every single thing was absolutely delicious  I think the happy hour here must be one of the best values ever in the history of happy hours  Our server was funny - seemingly a little distant but in actuality totally attentive and on top of every special request we had  Our favorite was our bus boy who had the nicest manners I've ever seen on an 18 year old  His family should be so proud of such a great young manWish we lived in town we'd be regulars  Thanks Fleming's for allowing us to enjoy a white table cloth evening while still enjoying time with our kids.
91,There is no shortage of Mexican restaurants in AZ and this one is one of the tops on my list  It's not your average Mexican fast food  It's a little more pricey but well worth it  Their bean and cheese burrito is so good (they say no lard and I don't know what else they use to make it good)  Their carne asada and pastor tacos are done to perfection  I stop by whenever I pass by this place.
2240,Love this place Authentic Japanese food and other items They are a small shop but have a nice selection and some other ethnic foods as well (Hawaiian Chinese etc) The staff is always courteous friendly and willing to help They won't try and sell you anything Every time I ask for assistance they always steer me to the most economical products that will accomplish my goals A few days ago I went in pick up some sake for cooking The older lady (perhaps an owner) asked me if I liked the brand of sake I had chosen I told her that I had never tried it but it was for cooking She recommended that I purchase a much cheaper smaller bottle if I was cooking with it only and showed me her recommendation ($249) I appreciate their honesty and integrity.
2894,Located in the suite the used to be Massage Envy this place is lovelyKudos to the better decor then what was previously there the atmosphere is clean and freshThe massage room is decorated nicely and I appreciated that they had a little place to put my bag and jewelry (something that's missing in a lot day spas)My therapist Dominique was attentive and thorough I really felt that he listened to the concerns I had and the reasons I had come in (back pain and a pulled hamstring) I am VERY picky about my massages and not easily pleased so I have to say i was pleasantly surprisedNext I'll try a facial stay tuned.
2936,"Worst Chinese food I've ever had I tried the Sweet And Sour Pork lunch special The rice supposed to be ""Fried rice"" but it was just your run of the mill Uncle Bens style brown rice that had zero flavorThe pork itself was tough and chewy The sauce for the pork was blandThe combo came with an egg roll which was soggy and had a weird flavor to it."
3174,I went today with three friends for dinner around 6 PM Sunday night Though it seemed quite busy I was pleased to get a seat within two minutes upon arrival Outside seating despite a hot Arizona summer was pretty nice with shade However this is where the pleasanties endOur table remain neglected for approximately twenty minutes No one bothered to offer us drinks and it was quite irritating to see tables who arrived after us being served appetizers When our waiter came he did not even apologize for the wait and we gave our orders: drinks appetizers and pita sandwichesThe hummus and garlic dip came relatively quickly only twenty minutes later Both were alright but something is seriously wrong if all of us were only served one pita with the two dips and each dip was more than twice the size of the pita We asked our waiter for extra pita and he kindly agreed The entire duration of dinner it never cameRefills were also a pain as we would ask someone to fetch our waiter and he wouldn't come until ten minutes laterAn hour after ordering could not possibly justify only four meager gyro sandwiches I've been to plenty of other businesses who have made that kind of order and more in just ten minutes during a busy lunch hour Half the tables outside already left including tables that arrived after us and we were the last ones served The food was of average quality and I've been to better with cheaper pricesSlightly expensive I can see as justified But many agree that time is worth much more than money I had an excessive amount over an hour and a half wasted on a decellerating Sunday night Staff is kind of nice but I suggest a serious change in priorities so that first time customers like myself aren't immediately turned off I can say for certain that I'm never coming here again and I'll find myself at better places much closer to home.
618,This just opened and I had never been into a Hi-Health so I was amazed at all the Nurtrition/Supplements that are available The staff was great at answering all my questions  - 5/5 stars I was also very impressed with how knowledeable the staff was - and patient with me in my quest to find a healthy way to loose weight --- just a few pounds I promiseGreat idea putting this right next to our local grocery store area Will make it very convenient to use in the future.
2390,Try the specials always amazing  I really like the carne adovada but once I tried the specials I have never ordered off the menu again  These chefs really know what they are doing  And the vegetables wow  How do they make them so tasty everytime  I think kids would even like the way they prepare vegetables.
2070,(Wait =7 min) + (Inspection = 3 min) = 10 minutes total I arrived at 6:45p on a Monday night There were 2 cars getting worked on  I've been at this location once before 2 years ago and I didn't have a long wait then either The manager was super friendly after I'm sure was a long day I will keep coming to this location.
4830,This Paradise Bakery makes all the others look awful The people that work there do not even care when customers are around and will just say inappropriate things its okay with me BUT NOT IN FRONT OF CHILDREN I was very offended and they weren't even my kids This was honestly the last strike The second strike was a HAIR in my fruit salad I mean that is just gross and made me wonder why everyone behind the counter weren't wearing hair nets The first strike is they are always out of something or another like edamame That is what makes the Asian salad No point in getting it Its a shame that this Paradise Bakery is so awful because it is the closest one to my house Guess I will have to drive all the way to Scottsdale and 101 if I want Paradise.
2212,This place gets it right from the moment you walk in the door Signed baseballs jerseys and bats by legends on the wall a friendly host to greet you and when you sit down they ask if you want free chopped liver It comes with bits of egg and onion warm rye bread and bagel chips Our waiter Jeff was friendly and attentive even lending us his flashlight to read an old newspaper story in the rafters The cream of mushroom soup made from scratch was superb Our mains were baby back ribs the specialty of the house cooked perfectly with a flavorful sauce The 'broasted' chicken was to die for: moist and juicy with a crispy outer skin The fries were piping hot as they should be And the portions are beyond generousWe topped it off with key lime pie light and tasty an ideal complement to the meaty mains And the bill was under $60 an amazing deal As a bonus some of the players drop in during spring training.
1330,"I went there yesterday because of the Yelp reviews which have done me very well in the pastThere slogan is ""Now that's a sandwich""It was definitely a sub sandwich but a really disappointing one and I really wanted this place to be good It is so difficult to find good mom and pop sandwich shops here in the valley The Yelp profile state they have wait service They do not I ordered the Dyker Heights Pastrami and Melted Swiss w/Sauerkraut and dressing which is thousand island The Boars Head pastrami was good but there was hardly any cheese on it It was mainly sauerkraut and the dressing was non existentThe sandwich is served hot but when I took my first bite either the pastrami or the kraut or the dressing was ice cold so it was an odd and unpleasant textureI would never order that sandwich againI got the red potato salad and it was bland I was putting black pepper and red pepper flakes on it in order to taste something Finally I got a Cherry RC from the fountainI didn't taste any cherry I have a buddy that really likes the food there so I might go back with him and see what he orders One thing that was confirmed for me if you're going to eat pastrami swiss and kraut do it on rye bread."
128,Had to find a new powder coater since my usual place went out of business recently  After a lot of checking a round I ended up here  Glad I did Great work fair price & quick turn around.
2321,This place is horrible We were staying right around the corner from here and were starving after the Giants spring training game and decided to come here one of the worst decisions ever We came here at about 9:30pm on Saint Patrick's Day and all we wanted was some food We got seated right away on the upstairs patio Our waitress came over very quickly and asked what we wanted to drink we ordered 2 waters and a beer it took 20 damn minutes to get JUST our waters 10 minutes after that the SINGLE beer my dad ordered came Our waitress came back at about 10:15 (45 minutes after we sat down) to take our order I ordered Chicken Strips and my dad ordered a Caesar salad could not be an easier order right WRONG It was almost 11 o'clock before our food came My fries were cold my chicken strips were gross and frozen pieces of crap thrown in to a deep fryer and tossed on my plate My dad's salad was just as disappointingI understand it was Saint Patrick's Day and the service might have been a little bit slower because of the crowd But my waitress did not even wait on the people in the bar nor did they serve food in the bar so the sucky-ness and slowness had nothing to do with that This place sucks A$$.
247,I have no idea how they ever received a 4 star rating This place was below mediocre first of all it had a very distinct smell in the whole restaurant and it was not a very appetizing one that's for sure Secondly the server only came by twice once to get our order and the second time to bring out the food she never bothered checking up on us or anything we actually had to flag someone else down just to get a refill The food was ok I ordered two blueberry pancakes with an egg and bacon as well as a half order of the biscuits and gravy The pancakes tasted as if they used a Bisquick mix and tossed in some unripe blueberries which was very disappointing because I usually LOVE pancakes out The biscuits and gravy on the other hand were much better but still not good enough to bring me back  John had the country fried steak and gravy served with hashbrowns and eggs He said the country fried steak itself wasn't bad but not his favorite the hashbrowns despite having them topped with cheese onions peppers and jalapenos were very bland and needed a good dash of salt Overall you would be much more satisfied going to your neighborhood Denny's than Hoosier Cafe in my opinion.
4326,I heard so many good thing about GB so I took a group of friends to work our way through all the offerings Between the seven of us we ordered everything that came around Some of it was out of this world and we desperately tried to remember which cart had what we liked so we could order more The best was better than anything I've had in San Francisco or New YorkToo many of the plates were terrible Some because they had been steaming or sitting too long or reheated too many times and a few because the ingredients were absolutely the very cheapest I've seen outside a school cafeteria About half of the plates were just inedible Effectively this doubled the price of the meal and soured us to the dishes we should have savored I won't go back unless it's with someone who knows which chef is working.
1926,Fun place tasty custard and excellent customer service  Both times I have been Keith has been behind the counter  He is very informative and was kind enough to let me try a few flavors before deciding on my vanilla custard with hot fudge  Will definitely be back:).
1479,"So my electric back hair shaver (aka MANGROOMER Do-It-Yourself Electric Back Hair Shaver)  was on the fritz and boy was my back getting a little to ""Robin William's"" like and I couldn't stand it any longer  I had to get it fixedThis place can repair any type of shaving device add new blades or they even sell you a new one if neededThey also sell and repair small appliances vacuum cleaners coffee pots and blenders---Really I just come here to get the blade and foil replaced on my razor The location on Northern and the one on Central are both closed now."
433,This place is the Pizzeria Bianco of the Phoenician Mexican food world -- excruciatingly long waits questionably overpriced occasionally brusque staff Unlike PB (which represents a wildly successful marketing coup) Los Dos is a wonderful little oasis in the armpit of South Phoenix My SO and I have been going for an embarrassing number of years (and accordingly the staff is super welcoming and we rarely wait) He occasionally demands a birthday dinner there Los Dos style -- they turn the lights off bang pots and pans scream their heads off and bring a festive dessertYes the food is hot Do you not know this when you go I mean you don't drive by this place on your way to the mall and think 'gee we should try that sometime' You are going to be in pain at both ends my friends but it's delicious Even their sour cream is special tweaked by the addition of subtle flavors of mysterious spicesThe margaritas may have grown weaker over the years or perhaps my liver has just ramped up to keep pace I've gotten falling down sloppy shitfaced here many a time The haters are just pissed off that the staff served their bratty attitudes right back to them instead of kissing their plump asses as they are so accustomed to and/or they are transferring their embarrassment about being pussies about the hot food Tough titty More for us.
4831,Low budget teenage hangout What a joke never go back  Fix this place and hire real people that want to work not high school drop outs.
4740,"After what I had read I expected this place to be dog friendly  As soon as I opened the door with leash and dog in hand I was pointed out the doorI'm guessing it's because they serve ""people food"" to  regardless  very disappointed  I will not be back."
2587,"I love this restaurant  If you consider yourself a gourmand one who seeks the best in life one who searches for innovative cuisine or just a lover of real food you will appreciate Quiessence  Check out their website (or call) to get a sense of the menuThey make a magical Valentine's Day dinner (and will do it on the 13th if you like the idea but not the extreme madness in going out for that evening)  I kept my menu and will stare at it longingly forever  We did the wine pairing with each course mmmmmm  I just don't have the time and money at this point in my life to do that kind of work so taking advantage of someone else's tastes (as long as they are excellent) is a beautiful thing to me  Fresh ingredients - local ones where possible - and damn good ones  Wonderful wait staff with whom to discuss your gastronomic experience  Setting: lovely South Mountain farm with pecan trees which includes Maya's Farm (produce are sold at the Downtown Public Market on Saturdays) and a brunch and lunch restaurant (all 3 are in separate areas/buildings)  Quiessence is pricey but definitely worth it  Take someone who will appreciate itUpdate 9 September 2007: We went here for our anniversary dinnermmm  Just as awesome as ever  I felt compelled to add a few things so people wouldn't be shocked when going there:- Portion sizes are fairly small so that you can choose one of each course  I'm sure that makes the prices (which you can find on the website under the menu) all the more shocking to some people  To me it's totally worth it- This restaurant is a good way to impress other people  Maybe your taste buds are poor but you are rich - you should still take people here :)  - Staff tip: amazing pears from Aravaipa Farms which has a bed & breakfast only about 25 hrs drive from Phoenix (on the way to Globe) but with a different microclimate http://wwwaravaipafarmscom/Update May 2008:  we went again for a celebratory dinner and got the brick oven table  I'm still so thrilled this place exists and that I can support it when my budget allows  The brick oven table with the wine pairings is a spendy (nearly $400 for the 2 of us) but worthwhile experience  The menu for the evening is personalized to your tastes  In the last year we found out one of us has a wheat allergy and one of us has a corn allergy  Those were some new things to accommodate and we mentioned that when making reservations expecting it to be accommodated  We had 8 courses and 9 glasses of wine each over the course of 55 hours  There was ample time to rest and relax in between courses and we were stuffed when we left (but  not unpleasantly so)  You're really in your own little private world at the brick oven tablefar enough from the noises of other diners to enhance your experience  Dustin was our server for the evening and we enjoyed all the info he shared about the ingredients in the food and the wines  Some of the wine pairings were extraordinary with the food  Some were surprising (one that tasted like its Spanish coastal terroir served with shellfish)  There were a few things that disappointed me though  Our allergies were forgotten a few times though when that happened replacement food was brought out promptly  For the most part our allergies were attended to well  However dessert sort of ruined things  We were initially brought a selection of lovely cake-like and crust-laden desserts  I mentioned the wheat  They were replaced with two citrus sorbets one grapefruit one lemon and lemon creme brulees  This was served with tawny port  No no no  All that sour citrusand port  I let them know that didn't work at all  Surely something could have been made - a flourless chocolate cake perhaps  The lemon creme brulee on its own would have been fine but with all of that mouth-puckering sorbetI still love the place I'm still glad it exists the service is superior and I love the use of wonderful-tasting fresh local ingredients but that dessert didn't work  Thank goodness for the other 7 courses (including a whole fish we picked cleanin addition to our meat course)In spite of the poor dessert choices this time around I'm convinced that people who think their food is ""overpriced"" or ""overrated"" have poor palates and probably rarely venture outside of chain restaurants where the food is laden with corn syrup MSG and other fake flavors  Every main course I've had there was outstanding."
2529,"Best Mexican Fast Food in town Love the Oaxaca burrito tortillas to go (great with butter) Other recommendations are the chicken burrito (very juicy) and the machaca plate It's all good Service is fast so don't worry if there's a line when you walk in It's normal I usually order to goavoid the restrooms at all cost If you must go expect the same experience as a ""Honey Bucket"" (very gross) If you want to dine in go to the Shea location The food is the same but bathrooms are much cleaner."
100,I love the food this place serves I had the Bandeja Paisa which was amazing The service is a bit slow but the wait is worth it I recommend this place to any one looking for good Ecuadorian food.
705,"Before doing this hike I read through almost every review I got mixed reviews and wasn't really sure what to expect So here goes what I thought:There are two trails (for sure there could be more but I understand these to be the two main trails): Cholla and Echo Canyon Cholla is supposed to be easierEcho Canyon is supposed to harderWe originally planned to hike Cholla but after the GPS lead us to the Echo Canyon parking lot and we spotted a parking spot we pounced (after reading that parking is crazy) I'm not sure how we got so lucky but we did Anyways we realized we were at Echo Canyon and decided we'd try it even though I thought it would be too challenging my family persisted Well I was wrongEcho Canyon is NOT as hard as I expected Yes it is all uphill Yes you have to ""climb"" in some parts but no you are not ""rock climbing"" I expected having to heave myself up a ledge it is NOT like that There are two parts with metal railings they are really just to assist you You can get up without them but they are helpful It doesn't feel like you're going to fall because basically it's all ROCKS You're climbing on big rocks so you won't struggle to keep from sliding down Not like that at all Continuing up the trail you have to use your hands to help go up but it's not like you're using a ton of upper body strength Mostly you're using your hands for balance and a little extra ""oomph"" The way down is easier but does kind of hurt your knees (more jumping but not as much strength) So the hike for us- Took my parents (two adults late-40's workout a few times a week) about 2 hours They thought it was pretty hard but very fun They took periodic breaks though and were fine- Took my brother and I (two teenagers) probably 15 hrs or so I workout through sports or the gym almost every day but I am NO superhuman athlete like I thought you had to be I was expecting to be struggling and panting and dying climbing Camelback but it really was NOT that bad - Yes you do need good athletic shoes Yes you do need water No I don't think you need gloves or any fancy gear A snack at the top won't hurt but I wasn't craving nourishment - Kids are maybe okay doing it I saw lots of families with younger kids and they were doing okay True the child probably has to be at least 8 or into doing a challenging hike You can always turn around though But do be careful Sadly we saw on the news that an older man died later that day hiking the Echo Canyon trail Really monitor how you're feeling it's okay to turn around it is a tough trail But if you workout and enjoy physical activity this hike should be fineOverall LOVED the hike and had tons of fun Great workout and just a fun way to get active."
4472,Horrible food Vomiting now  Salsa nasty your better off buying dalsa from a jar Restaurant looks dirty menus dirty and sticky 1 taco for 485  Food was just nasty Definitely not authentic in any way Taco bell has better food and im not even a taco bell person Save your money dont go here.
2032,"When I first dreamed up how this review would go I intended to say ""Chicago dog fans your savior is here"" and leave it at that The problem with that is I've tried some of the other offerings of Lobby's and have realized how much more they have to offerYes absolutely this is THE place to get a Chicago-style hotdog There are other hotdog joints but none of them seem to offer an authentic Chicago dog experience You will not find a single ingredient missing and it is all made fresh right before your eyesHaving said that there is far more to Lobby's than just the dogs Their fries are amazing and extend into ""how-will-I-ever-eat-anything-else"" territory with the addition of chili and cheese They also offer a burger made for bragging rights: 3 lbs of delicious cheeseburger Finish it quick enough and you'll have your picture added to the hall of fame Plus the staff is always very friendly and the place is always immaculateWhen my 3-year-old nephew dined with us here he had a plain hotdog He smashed the bun flat against the hotdog and told me it tasted better that way That's not particularly important for the review but I wanted to share that anyway So there you go Lobby's has quickly turned into one of my favorite go-to restaurants."
313,Ate here for the first time loved it  Great service reasonable prices and awesome food.
1610,This is an update to my previous nightmare with Safeway Home DeliveryI received what you may consider a Make-shift receipt with only information  typed into the body of an email Safeway was kind enough to type in the date of the transaction along with the total tax fuel surcharge and delivery charges   The printout was good enough for me to submit for reimbursement so at this point that's all that countsHowever I am not amused or impressed by Safeway in the least   15 days after placing an order is way to long to have to fight with a monster grocery store chain who should know betterI have no plans on being a repeat customer.
2284,A friend and I decided to try Wallys because they were having a prime rib special The internet and menu stated the special was available after 4PM We arrived at 4:15 The waiter said that it would be an hour before the prime rib was ready We asked to speak with the owner He came over and we explained that we came beause of the special and it would not be ready for another hour He started screaming at us and told us to leave He said 4PM was a typo on the internet and also on his menu He told us to leave his restaurant and never come back We were so scared that he would get violent He definately has a mental condition.
4151,Ordering food for a friend  I would never eat at Panda  Unflavorful and greasy  I am writing more about the service  Yes I guess it was food court after all but that still does not make it right to have bad customer service  The cashier reached over the counter to grab this small container to see what was in it  I told her orange chicken and then she threw it back in my bag and it was tipped over  Careless.
2831,"So I lived in Phoenix for 2 years and never tried back  I ventured back recently on business and decided I must make the pilgrimage Went first on a Tuesday night  We were told the wait would be 2 hours so we decided to go to Nobua instead  We went back on Thursday night around 9PM and were able to get in with just a 20 minute wait I LOVE neapolitan style pizza  Here in Dallas I go to Cavalli's on a regular basis and love it  I knew I would love Bianco the big question is would I think it is the ""best pizza in America""It might be  Honestly any certified Neapolitan pizza place is going to be nearly as good as Bianco  It's not rocket science it's just the right oven and the right ingredients and the right touch  However I will say Bianco might do it a touch better than the rest The crust is amazing  It's perfectly done with just enough burnt on the edges for my taste  I ate every piece of edge there was which is unusual for me  (I tend to leave some crust edge)  The toppings are perfect the Sopprasata was amazing the fennel sausage was great the sauce was perfect It's basically the perfect pizza  Yet I was kind of disappointed  It made me realize that I've tasted the best pizza out there and it is only slightly better than some local places  I guess I should look at it in a good way that I can drive 10 minutes and get an amazing pizza at Cavalli any day of the week a pizza that rivals the best in America."
69,Talk about fresh food and great prices this place has it all  When I first tried it I was a skeptic but then I had the food and I was greatly surprised by the good taste and quality of the food  I suggest the Tri Star Mongolian it was to die for   Plus the shrimp fried rice had plenty of shrimp and was good in size too  I order from this place at least once a week and I can make 3 or 4 meals from one entree  Try it and you will be pleasantly surprised of the value and taste  :-).
3404,"We would have loved to experience this first annual Chandler BBQ event however due to some piss poor planning we and hundreds of other people were left out in the cold (or should I say hot) See this event was supposed to go from 10am-9pm on Saturday but by 1:30pm when we arrived they announced via megaphone that no more tickets were being sold and they were apparently ""out of meat"" Please tell me how an event which is supposed to go all day until 9pm blows it load just three hours into the festivities To make matters worse when we were turned away they explained that they'd be re-opening ticket sales at 4pm and more food would be available So we planned our whole afternoon around this and wasted time until 4 When we arrived for our second attempt of the day to our shigrin they changed their minds yet again and reneged on what they had said earlier Now tickets were on sale for five bucks but there was no BBQ No BBQ at a BBQ Fest ex-fucking-scuse me Basically five bucks to walk around and stare at a bunch of empty BBQ reminants it just didn't make much senseSo many people drove across town to come here (including us) and I really hope next time they put some more time into the planning of this event it has promise Hopefully we'll be able to return next year and actually be able to review the food and not the ill planned event itself Grrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr."
2234,"I know it must be hard to be a coffee company competing in the world with Starbucks and I get the hook this place is trying to pull off BUT here's the deal you can't be hipster and elitist and the same time  I tried to order a vanilla latte and I thought that the woman behind the counter was going to stroke out right in front of me  ""We really don't recommend you put flavoring in our coffee"" Well I really don't recommend you scold customers when they try to pay for your product I will drink my coffee however I like it  I don't need a undereducated 30 year old barista to tell me how I should drink my lattes  Sooo if you like over priced coffee BLACK and black only then go on down to Cartel but if you ask for sugar be ready for a berating - don't worry that part is fee they don't charge extra for it."
28,First of all I visited this place many times in the past many years They used to be a great place to have dim sum I was never so disappointed like this We walked in today (Saturday at 12:24PM) and was wondering where the customers are Saturday is usually the most busy day for every dim sum places The restaurant is pretty empty out We sat down and order 5 dishes That's where the problem came I don't like to be treated like moron Why there is 6 dishes marked on the sheet We kindly asked manager to check it out Long story short they turn into deny mode And finally removed the extra marked item we never ordered without offering any apology and sorry Mistake does happen but don't pretend that you don't know it Admit it The portion of the dishes are also shrinking With the price and services I can find better dim sum place Yes I am really picky on the food quality and service Fool me once is enough I will suggest everyone to pay attention on the bill Always count how many items you ordered and how many are marked on the bill I have post pictures as well.
2434,I simply love Wal-Mart and this is my local and once again in walking distance locale right near my apt I mean what more could I sayWal-mart has everything you need but what makes this one great is that they price match ANYTHINGso you don't have to run all over the valley to do your shopping Wal-mart is you one stop shop for everything from electronics to grocerieshousewares to lawn and gardenauto care to home cleaning supplies Eat Drink and be Merry my Friends.
3694,This is without a doubt the worst drive thru I have ever been to in my life Whenever I've gone through they've messed up my order have given me lip and in general it feels like they try to place the blame on me for my order being wrong This place is rude they can't get the orders right and worst of all they do not take allergens into account We specified we wanted plain cream cheese because my girlfriend has a tree nut allergy so instead of that they gave us herb and garlic What that tells me is that they do not value their customers nor the information given to themTLDR: It was NOT a great day at Dunkin.
2598,"2/19/1345 starsReceived a text** from Crust alerting that all entrees were $10 each (dine-in only) so I stopped by after work  Having combed the menu during one of my breaks I knew I was going to try two new (to me) pasta dishes the Ravioli Pesto Cream and Grandma's Pasta and a half (crustless) Tuscan saladI was welcomed immediately when I entered and was seated  My server came by shortly with a glass of water and asked if I'd like to order anything else for dinner so I asked to try a sample of the week's special red blend before I ordered a full glass  I've rarely been disappointed with their selections and sure enough I liked what I tried and asked for a glass  I placed my food order tweaking the Ravioli dish a little by asking that the kitchen sub out the usual chopped fresh tomatoes for artichokes (I'd asked Mitch on the phone earlier if this would be OK and he said ""no problem"") and asked if I could have some table bread as wellTen minutes passed and I still hadn't received any bread nor the small crustless salad I'd ordered but I was reading while I waited so I wasn't too worried although I did ask a passing server to see what was going on  Around five to ten minutes later my dishes arrived and these came with a dinner roll each so the missing bread was forgotten (although it's always nice to have some extra to enjoy at home)  The salad was still missing so when my server came by for a check-up I mentioned it and he said he'll look into it  A few minutes later a full order of a Tuscan salad arrived  (Because of the mix-up the salad was on the house- thanks Crust)The Pesto Ravioli Cream with artichokes was terrific http://wwwyelpcom/biz_photos/crust-pizza-and-wine-cafe-scottsdaleselect=FxAhyaHn1yiexaqxjH5P3w"
2912,Great food Fantastic service Lovely atmosphere Dinner was absolutely Delicious I wasn't sure if I liked some of the sauces that came on the entree & the waitress had me taste everything before I made my final choice It was a busy night & she apologized for our food not being up faster without me even complaining about it & gave us 20% of our bill The atmosphere was casual & relaxed The staff is so friendly & welcoming you just can't help but feel comfortable & happy to be there They have a return customer in me :).
84,I like this place Parking is easy in back Service is good Price is reasonable I like to get the Pad Thai level 5 hot I also like the Fried Rice with Pork I suggest you go  with level 5 heat and lots of water.
3318,My problem is not with the pet supplies or the quality food they carry it was with the GROOMER  My golden was brought in for a bath and brush and came home with CLIPPER BURN and OPEN SORES on his behind  He was matted there from swimming in the pool and I consented to shaving his hindquarters shaved  When I explained how I felt when I saw my dog and his obvious discomfort with the groomer there was no empathy no apology and no culpability She didn't even put anything on the affected areas to soothe his discomfort before she sent him home  She will get no return business from me and no referrals EVER   The owner did however refund my money when I asked for a refund  She did apologize for the incident.
3854,MY EXPERIENCE: We take a seat at a table in the corner  It wasn't set so a busser brings our water & utensils she is carrying the end of the utensils we're about to put in our mouth  There is hair in my water  Dude takes the water away saying yeah that's gross (he didn'tapologise)  My hash brown layer concoction was awful  Felt like I was eating plastic tasted like it too eggs were rubbery & only two small strips of bacon  My companions chicken fried steak wasn't bad though they forgot to bring his side of corn beef hash proceed to bring him hash browns and then the corn beef hash  He was done with his food before they brought either of them out  The gentleman in the back putting butter in the pans wasn't wearinggloves (the other cooks were) and picks up a piece of butter he dropped yip with his hands  Our server sits at the bar near us & inhales his food quite a sight  No one asked how our meal was  He brings us our check my full plate of food is sitting right there still doesn't ask us about our meal  We ask for a to go box my companion looks inside and it's got an oil puddle and oops some MORE hair  We pay and run out of there  I personally am too afraid of going back there in the fear of I might 'catch' something but then again maybe it was a combination of my bad luck and a bad day for them.
1784,I have know Susan for over a year and have always found her very knowledgable about any questions that I have had regarding signage  I have referred several people to her and none of them have been disappointed with what they bought.
2022,I like this place I like the friendly helpful staff and their check outs Prices are reasonable for the most part good selection of dairy free alternatives cheaper produce then our local grocery shops Never bought anything that I haven't been happy with.
3449,I heard about Mistique when I bought a living social deal a few months ago I paid $29 for a hot stone pedicure and hand massage valued at $60 I was very excited to try a new place and assumed it was something special considering I never pay $60 for a pedicureMy first impression of the boutique was that it was small modern and I really enjoyed the overall vibe- but where are the pedicure spa chairs There was one small chair and the woman came out from the back carrying a large ceramic bowl filled with hot water I don't know about anyone else but I really like the massage chairs and the jets that are standard at most nail salons It was a disappointment not having thatThe woman who did my pedicure was funny and very friendly but I don't think she does a lot of pedicures The paint looked sloppy and since I hadn't worn my own sandals I left barefootCute decor and friendly tech doesn't mean I want to go back for a VERY overpriced crappy looking pedicure.
1125,Been going here for years Always get the same thing for my husband when kids and I have eaten already I bring him the mojarra frita and it's always been consistently delicious People are friendly too.
679,Amazing resort  Stayed here for five days over Thanksgiving week this year and was extremely impressed with every aspect of The Boulders resort  Will definitely stay here again next time I'm in the Scottsdale areaPros: The staff was overwhelmingly accommodating and helpful (they use golf carts/shuttles to transport you to different areas of the resort by request which was very much appreciated thanks Bill from Wisconsn)  The location was absolutely gorgeous and unlike anywhere I've ever been before (beautiful enormous boulders surrounding the resort grounds Saguaro cacti all around golf areas were beautiful and the various ponds and wildlife) The casita was pristine had a wood-burning fireplace (which we used a LOT) bed was super comfortable (I hadn't slept that well in months) and the bathroom was also amazing (double sinks bath tub glass shower walk-in closet etc)The Golden Door spa was very luxurious and the staff were very nice and professional  The massage was amazing as were the various saunas   The pool at the spa (which is open to all resort guests) was very relaxingMy boyfriend and his parents went golfing at The Boulders and they said that it was exceptional  More specifically:  the practice area (driving range short game area and putting green) was worth visiting on its own the course itself was extremely well run and the fairways and greens were in impeccable shape  Overall an extremely fun place to golf.
1861,"If it's possible my love for Postino has only increased I decided to throw a baby shower for my friend here and it turned out beautifully I never had a problem with my calls being returned and the managers I spoke to were extremely helpful and friendlyWe had our shower at the front of the restaurant which utilized both indoor and outdoor couches We had the space for 2 hours plus they let us come in early to decoratePricing is wonderful for a larger party If you have the party inside the restaurant like we did regular menu pricing applies You could have it out on the lawn using the catering menu pricing which is an even better deal I also love that they don't charge for bringing in a cake You can order cookies through their sister restaurant Churn which is a great dessert optionI fed a party of ten 4 bruschetta boards a cheese board bottle of wine and ""mass-mosa"" (bottle of champagne + OJ carafe) for ~$10 a person plus tip I pre-ordered some paninis too but ended up cancelling them at the last minute and our waitress was very nice about itOverall it was a fun beautiful day and our baby shower went very smoothly I would host another party here in a heartbeat."
3811,This used to be one of my fav places for good home-style Italian dining Especially for a late night dinner --because the kitchen stayed open much later than other restaurants in Phoenix I had heard that there were new owners and I am very disappointed   The very stingy serving of bread is plain and ordinary and forget about getting seconds The Alfredo sauce is bland -- like maybe it was from a can  The pasta was over-cooked and reheated to slightly above room temperature The service is so-so   Sad.
1523,Lux is a weekend staple-- Saturday without Lux would be akin to missing a critical appendage  Well maybe not but pretty damn close As others have said the coffee is fantastic actually the best I've ever had  The espresso is always perfect  I have a weakness for their iced mochas-- really the only iced mochas I've ever liked Not too sweet not too bitter not too anything just pure awesomeness  And their whipped cream  It took me about a year of visiting Lux to discover this sweet surprise but it is so good  Still not sure what the special twist is but it is goooooood And their baked goods are better than any I've had at a coffee shop  Most are made on-site in an adorable little kitchen in the hallway  My love of baking tempts me to slip in tie on an apron and start baking- but I've held myself back from offering unsolicited help  At least thus far   The staff is always friendly and always remembers your name (or at least makes a concerted effort to do so) It's generally crowded-- which makes sense being as it is in my humble opinion the best coffee shop in Phoenix maybe Arizona maybe the US Somehow the crowds and loud music never bother me-- and I can always find a seat   Lux is one of those places that seems like it would be too hip for my taste-- everything about the decor ambiance and clientele suggests this but for some reason it still feels comfortable and friendly  Maybe it's the warm embrace of out-of-this-world espresso and brioche whatever it is it's a fantastically addicting way to start my weekend.
4348,I was very upset not with the quality of food but with the quality of management I witnessed a manager say inappropriate things about a young girl and spoke about Wetzels and how they determine who works there I'm sorry - but if she bought a pretzel and asked for an app there's no excuse for rude behavior Also before you make snide remarks about customers you should realize that customers pay your measly salary Auntie Anns from now on.
3734,"$$$$$ Hard Liquor & Hard Beats DOWNTOWN Phoenix $$$$BRING YOUR CREDIT CARDSAn outdoor bar/dance club in front of the building next door to Fate (situated right off Roosevelt Row in The Evans-Churchill District)  Nightly DJs  and outdoor drinking (and dancing ()) with a PERFECT view of the ever improving downtown skyline  Sadly they have NO ""shelf/house"" liquor selections so drink prices are pretty Damn HIGH  I mean WAAAY high  $11 for the cheapest rum & cokeThis is YET AGAIN another business venture making another huge improvement in the Downtown Art District  HOWEVER sadly the drink prices are just to high for this place to become much of a regular hang-out."
4021,We wrote Linda an email about 2 weeks ago explaining we are switching all of our insurance to someone else beginning the 23rd of November (we got the exact same homeowners insurance at Allstate for almost $200 less dollars) and how we felt and she or someone else in her office never even replied.
2575,"Finally got to try the bread pudding  here and it was unbelievable Not as unbelievable as Charlestons but is definitely making the list for ""Best Bread puddings"" (see list) Also tried the tuna sammich with avocado as I wanted something simple That tomato herb bread that they use is extraordinary The sammich was great just like everything else I have had here."
2242,I LOVE THIS PLACE I have been going here for years and the atmosphere is amazing and still not as great as the super fresh food It's gotten a little crazy since the Food Network show (I was there the day after not realizing and the line was INSANE) but it doesn't dissuade me Especially when you can take a walk down the path after and burn off a few calories and scope out the farm itself.
3551,"_the worst ""mexican"" Ive ever had_deserves no stars_because everything tasted like it came from a can (enchilada saucebeanssalsa)_because everything was made with absolutely no effort_it smells of sewage and cigarettes inside_dim lighting in restaurant and very dark parking lot."
2824,To put it simply  This place sucks I have been asked to eat there three times for breakfast in the last three months for business meetings You always let the customer choose where to eat unfortunately they have all asked to meet at the Good Egg on Central How do you screw up Breakfast Wellhave cold Eggs cold Potato's and cold toast Three out of three times Horrible Coffee and VERY EXPENSIVE OMG kill me now if I have to eat there again The only thing I can say that is positive the servers seem to be attentive Go up the road and have Breakfast at 5 and Dinner on 16th St Not great but at least you'll get a hot Breakfast and get your money's worth.
474,Douchebags Short skirts and crappy house musicPerfect for 20-30 year old range.
3859,"As you may have read the ""tip"" you already know our experience was one of the saddest we have had since moving to the valley So much so that I created this yelp account just to express how terrible it was Is the food good Don't know It never arrived after waiting 30 minutes for a burrito Is the beer (hefe) good No At least the first 10oz weren'tNever had waiter come back to try anything else Poor service reflects poor management(""louie"" sp) very pricey and in no way a brewery in my eyes Steer clear and try Sun Up brewery instead Waaay better beer food and outstanding service Might give osho another shot someday when I'm not hungry or thirsty or have something to do or awake Hope this helps fellow yelpers Oh ya and if you're a blonde stripper/escort driving a fancy Mercedes you'll get valet to park it right at the door priority order service and skip the valet wait line at pick up Now that's a classy jointUPDATE Contacted by actual manager the day after posting seeking resolution That's a big deal in my book Looking forward to returning and giving OHSO another tryStay tuned for the next update."
4954,This restaurant is WAY over priced for the quality of food presented  Starting with the salad the flavor of the ranch dressing was off bad after taste  The halibut cheeks had no flavor and tasted like cardboard  The rice pilaf tasted like Uncle Ben's and the veggies were way over cooked and cold  No redeeming value for anything on the plate  Save your time AND money It's not worth the walk downstairs.
3972,"I stopped in on my way home from work to get an oil change  I didn't have an appointment but it was 3 on a Wednesday and I didn't see a single car in the shop  I wasn't greeted as much as sneered at  Of course he couldn't fit me in for a 30 minute oil change without an appointment so I asked if there were any other locations  He informed me that no one would be able to do same day oil changes  Really  Mid-day Mid-week  He was totally dismissive and completely unhelpful  I agree with the other comments that he quickly sized me up as being an ""oil change coupon"" customer and decided the owner didn't need my money I've been to this Midas location in years past and had a COMPLETELY different experience   I'll never go back to this location."
3911,Went on a Friday during happy hourtacos were supposed to be half pricethey weren't and they weren't any good eitherNo booze here  and it didn't feel like any air conditioning Blech try Los Dos Molinos for real Mexican food.
1145,"There are so many ""Berto's"" in Phoenix that it's not even funny  Humberto's is next door to my rinky dink apartment  So it's convenient  I went in expecting to find a typical dive  However this place was clean and there was a lone man in there manning the grill  I immediately ordered my ""safe"" meal - a Carne Asada Burrito I was happy to see the man toss some raw meat onto the grille and make it fresh  He took great care in putting chili in it and then slapped it into a huge tortilla  He also put a MOUNTAIN of guacamole into it which was the only downfall  I will next time as for cheese instead  So I ate it and it was good  It was very big and filling as well  I will be returning to this place time and time again."
4032,I heard so many great things about it I stopped once with my family to find that they only took cash but didn't have an ATM in the lobby So I went back when I was on my way to school to grab something and got a seriously bad stomach ache Very disappointed.

3603,"This used to be Johnson's Cleaners an excellent long standing Phoenix dry cleaner with a knack for repairs I gave the new owners a few tries and it was a disaster Just because something is allegedly ""organic"" does not mean it's healthy Turned out I am extremely allergic to the chemical or ""natural"" ingredient in the dry cleaning solvent I broke out in hives up to my face by the time I got to work I have never had a reaction to anything like that before and it took a few weeks before I realized it was the clothes that had been dry cleaned at this shop Since then I've tried to wash the clothes that are washable fabrics (eg linen) and changed to Uptowne Cleaners but I never could wear some clothes ever againSince I changed dry cleaners I haven't had any more hives."
3298,"I don't trust these folks at all  I was contacted by Quicken when I signed up for Lending Tree (a big mistake don't use Lending Tree)  When the agent called I told him I was looking for a 10 year re-finance at a fixed rate  I specifically told him I needed to know what the best rate and the costs would be  It took several calls from the agent before he finally told me their rate and cost  The rate was 1% higher than a competing lender and their costs were twice as much  I told him I would go with the other less expensive lender and then he got real aggressive telling me that Quicken was the best lender in the business (yeah right)  Once I finally got him to understand that cost was the deciding factor he then recommended I let him review the loan docs from the other lender  I didn't even know this guy why would anyone let a stranger look over your loan docsAfter finally getting off the call I started receiving repeated calls from another Quicken agent  I finally took one of the calls to tell her to stop contacting me  Since then the emails have been coming fast and furious even when I replied asking them not to contact me at all  One of the emails my request came from the original lending agent saying something to the effect of ""call me and let's set up an appt to discuss your loan""If you want to avoid being pestered indefinately NEVER contact Quicken Loans."
975,"Modern Steak has a new Happy Hour menu but some of the old great HH items are still on the new menu Have no fear    all is still Happy at Modern Steak PS Had a great server named ""Rachel"" on our last visit On the patio A table of 10 who all ordered multiple items and multiple drinks and wanted separate checks and Rachel did not miss a beat or mix anything up      and most importantly she did it with a sweet smile  Great server  I hope we tipped her well."
2728,We have been looking for a good Asian style restaurant that fit our needs since we have moved to AZ We heard about Asian Island through a friend and we decided to try it The not only had all our favorites but the prices were reasonable and all the food was very fresh Everyone was very friendly and the overall atmosphere was very comfortable I would recommend this to anyone who loves Asian food I will definitely eat at Asian Island again.
1596,We were going to the movies today and did a Yelp search for resturants This place was at the top of the list and for good reason Its fantasitc Apon entering i was taken by the great decor and cleaness We ordered Spicy Edemime and Potstickers to start off Then i got the Arizona Sushi Roll and my wife got a noodle dish We will back Loved it.
1438,Really great cut and service here definitely recommend and will be back for my next cut.
990,"Decided to try Safeway's home delivery Glad we used the ""free"" delivery code for the first delivery (and last delivery)  We didn't set our expectations very high we knew there would be some product change out due to the lack of bar code/item number ordering no biggie  Over half our order wasn't even packed to be delivered  The delivery driver was really nice and very professionalWe called customer service right after the driver left and were greeted very ho-hum you called for what  The gentleman on the other end of the phone wasn't very concerned with taking care of the customer  His fix was to credit an item that was rotten and the remainder of our order would be delivered before end of day NOTWe got a phone call at the end of the day that the delivery would not be coming back out to our house today so we would have to reschedule the delivery  Good thing we were trying their service and didn't have an immediate need for the items they neglected to send the first timeOver all we are really disappointed in the quality check for the fresh items accuracy check for the items ordered and the lack of customer service provided by the initial gentleman on the phone  Safeway delivery made no real effort to take care of us the customer."
3108,"Wow  If it was possible to give a place negative stars I would have  I purchased a gift certificate for this restaurant on restaurantcom  My husband and I took our three small children there on Saturday night  The hostess looked annoyed that she had to seat us  Once at the table three waiters passed us by without asking what we wanted to drink etc  Once we had been there for about 6 minutes a bus boy brought us some salsa  He asked if we knew about the salsa and I said no we hadn't eaten there in years  His response was ""oh it's the same"" which didn't explain anything at all  We continued to sit for another 10 minutes or so with no drinks and thirsty children as waiter after waiter passed us by  The table that got seated 30 seconds before us got their food and we still hadn't been served even a glass of water  At this point we left  On my way out I decided I should talk to a manager  The bartender got him for me  As he was coming to the front he refused to make eye contact with me and actually passed me right by and was chatting with the hostess at the station  When I said ""excuse me"" he turned and said ""yeah""  I explained to him what happened and that we were leaving and his response was to turn to me gesture to the restaurant and say ""the restaurant is full you think you make a difference  I have never been so insulted in my life  I would never return to this restaurant and I would never ever recommend it to anyone  What a disaster  The customer sevice sucks the manager is an ass and the entire experience was a total joke."
2663,AWESOME Greens golf course layout has a little bit of this and that and the staff is great a must play golf course.
4193,My husband was after me to try this restaurant somehow i never got a good feel about it but we finally tried hated the food everything tasted bad some strange sweet svory taste that was not good we just ate whatever we could and hurried out of there.
1161,PERFECTIONBest restaurant in AZ hands down It is over the top From the moment you walk in the service the execution of the food the wine pairings the artistry of the menu from the moment you leave - a handwritten thank you note water and chocolates in your car Everything is on point Pure artistry and close attention to every detail Very very expensive but worth it The price point will probably keep me from becoming a regular but I very much look forward to returning again.
373,Born and raised in this place for the most part I've been coming here for over twenty years This restaurant is not traditional Mexican food but it makes no claims to be The fajitas here are the best in Phoenix hands down The seasoning on the meat and shrimp is perfect the salsa and queso are both fantastic The customer service is phenomenal.
3724,Yuck Just ordered a chicken pita and it was completely tasteless and soggy Won't be back.
3851,Undergoing cancer treatment is difficult  Undergoing cancer treatment at Ironwood Cancer & Research Center is HELL  We were on time for our appointment and still waited 2 hours for the infusion  The infusion center was overflowing with patients  Family members had no where to sit  The nurses constantly bumped into me and asked me to move as they tried to maneuver through the aisle A treatment that was supposed to last 2 hours lasted 5   We are leaving Ironwood and I would never recommend it  Ardon the infusion nurse is especially rude.
1431,This is a great dive bar with a little stage  I used to live right across the street from this place and when i needed to find something to do i headed over to this cool punk rock style bar its actually hard core  A couple of pool tables too Fun fun fun and inexpensive and just down the street is a convenience store and dance and strip clubs close enough for ASU students to get away from University and Mill Ave From LA to Arizona this is another one my favorite places besides the powerhouse (hollywood) the rusty spur (old townscottsdale) and the roadrunner (n Scottsdale) without feeling out of place.
3760,The was the worst maintained course I've played on maybe ever I could see more brown dirt than green grass on much of the fairways and even the greensI won't go back and I will tell people to avoid.
958,"This is great New Mexico-style Mexican food  The ""Land of Enchantment"" is a stand out dish--steak with 2 shrimp and a chicken enchilada: Very good  There were lots of things I wanted to try on a future visit  Great salsa and that dark red Santa Fe-like sauce whatever its called This place has good service great food and good atmosphere Definitely have some of the more NM-styled dishes rather than the basic Mex fare."
2327,Great guy prompt and excellent service great prices  I drove down from Cave Creek because of Yelp reviews I wasn't disappointed.
2440,I've been to Ocean Prime 3 or 4 times over the last year each time for larger business dinners  This time there were just three of us sitting and the bar  We had good drinks great laughs and a delicious buttery crab and spinach drink  I highly recommend the cucumber gimlet if you're gameWe decided to stay and order from the bar  While ordering I selected the bone-in filet and asked for the peppercorn sauce on the side  I wasn't 100% sure if I'd like it So I wanted to be safe not sorry  It was a $48 entreeWhen dinner was served my steak had the peppercorn sauce smothered all over it  I sent it back  Not happy about the request the bartender returned my steak to the kitchen for a redo  I would have never thought they'd bring the sane exact steak back to me sans sauceHow do I know  Size/shape/texture and my buddy ordered the same temperature as me but mine was much more re-cookedFrustrated and hungry I ate the flavor-washed steak and kept my mouth shut Last time I eat here  The end.
1178,Started off being a favorite however the service has gone down hill fast  There are two male  workers named Daniel and Peter and are absolutely horrible One of them was so busy cruising the female customers and staring at their bodies and the other one was incredibly rude and condescending There are plenty of other restaurants around the area that provide much better service.
305,"I have had the oppertunity of knowing and working with Randy for the past 20 years  He is the only tint comopany I will take my vehicles to (new or used)  My friends and family use Randy as well and have stated ""they will always use him for tint""Customer service is a top priority for Randy and his wife Donna they are family owned and operatedIf your looking for a tint shopgo see Randy and tell him Dee sent ya."
4584,We are used to snappy service and a clean restaurant at VI This VI had neither  4:30  on a Sunday afternoon shouldn't be too busy and in fact there were maybe 3 parties in the whole restaurant but getting waited on was a challenge  Forget refills on drinks  And I actually had to walk into the kitchen to tell the staff that we were ready to order pie ( which I'd already alerted our waiter that we wanted)  Finally got waited on by another server who was taking over for our waiter who was on break   We got our desserts and our bill which included about 3 items we hadn't ordered  We brought that to the attention of our waiter who was back from break and acted like he had caught it and had corrected it NOT  We had to wait  for a new bill   That's just my commentary on the service  I won't bore you with the cleanliness issues  The staff and apparently the management aren't interested in making money  We won't be back.
556,"First of all if there is any indication that this place might be busy turn around and find a new place to eat It's not unusual for the wait for your food to be up to 2hrsWe ordered a salad and a sandwich to go and waited over an hour for it The salad came out within 15 minutes but the sandwich took so long that by the time I was ready to eat my salad it was a wilted slimy mess The owner was not helpful at all and we asked her to check on our ticket she just said ""Yeah it's up there"" This place has a small kitchen and when there is a large crowd it is just possible or them to keep up with the demand Crappy service high prices and a flaw in organization has lost them a customer."
1842,Just about my favorite place in Arizona I love to run bike or walk around at this park They also have boat rentals which I recommend Great for a picnic or having ice cream with friends The view at sunset is breathtaking They have events like beer fests marathons and concerts throughout the year And the best fireworks in the area for the Fourth of July If you love the outdoors and haven't been here you are missing out.
1905,I come here almost every morning for my breakfast smoothie Staff is always friendly and the smoothies and always good They are much cheaper then other smoothie places and you get more I personally think they taste better as well They also allow you to change up the ingredients in the smoothies to you liking.
3782,My family and I visited this chili's a few nights ago when we had company in town and decided to stop in for dinner after shopping near by We had walked past people who told us is was an hour wait time we chose to go in and check it for ourselves when we walked in we asked the host for a table for 5 he said im sorry but there is an hour wait (no one was waiting in the lobby and as I looked around there were many open tables) it was 7:30ish pm so they weren't getting ready to close I asked if they were short staffed because there were many tables open he said yes I see them myself and no we aren't short staffed that is just what my manager had asked me to tell people WOW so I look over to the bar area and see a table over there and asked if it was open seating and he said yes so that is where we sat We waited over 10 min for us to be greeted service was very slow people continued to walk in the door asking for tables as the host still continued to tell them the 1hr wait time I saw at least 5 or more groups of people walk out (what manager runs a business like this why would he not wan his place full I have worked in this industry for 10+ years including chili's for 2+years a one point and I have NEVER seen a restaurant ran that way Anyways aside from that the 1 server taking on the entire bar section is being flooded with more people because they are no longer seating the dining area the manager ran a few items which came over without a smile or how is everything he in fact was rude and seemed inconvenienced to bring us anything The mushroom burger my sister ordered was not a mushroom burger it was actually a regular burger that they just added mushrooms on top it had red onions instead of saut√©ed onions it had pickles and lettuce tomato etc all the fixings that would come on a regular burger I told the server to let him know so they weren't continuing to serve it this way to other guests ad he said ok thanks I can get you a free desert if you want to which we declined I would definitely not want to go into that chili's again until they hired a manager that can run a restaurant.
3744,THIS LOCATION HAS CLOSED- See their new Raul & Theresa's on Litchfield Road just north of I-10.
533,Just moved to this area and tried this place for the first time Lovely attentive staff and nice interior The food was amazing We had samosas chicken tikki masala curry shrimp and garlic naan I can't wait to go back and try more dishes A little pricey (never had to order rice seperately) but worth it.
4947,meh it was ok hot yoga  hard to find.
3414,Went to blue agave last night for taco Tuesday My girlfriend and I got food poisoning and still have symptoms 24 hours later Beware of dollar tacos because taco Tuesday will lead to vomit vednesday Sever was nice though so I will give it a star I pretty much don't want to ever eat Mexican food ever again for the rest of my life.
2633,This is the best bbq in phoenix omg I am a fan of any place that serves meat by the lb and uses a beverage crate as a plate I ordered the pork spare ribs (I asked for a full pound and didn't need it) the rub was spicy and the meat was moist and just about fell off the bone We also had the mac and cheese homemade and perfect My husband ordered the Texas Po Boy sandwich a full pound of meat Smoked sausage brisket and pulled pork it was so flavorful He also ordered the green beans I didn't try them but he said they were very tasty The staff was very friendly The chef (maybe owner) gave us a sample of brisket We got there before 7 (closing time) but no one rushed us and the waitress even stood and chatted with us for a bit When we are on this side of the valley again we will definitely be eating there again.
2260,Anytime I am in the area I stop here for a boba tea  Love the atmosphere and the drinks I highly recommend this place.
4877,I've been to yogurt mart two times now  Initially I was excited to a yogurt place walking distance from my friend's home who I visit frequently  The first time it was passible the person ringing us out was nice The place looked clean but it was missing a sparkly new feeling that I can't quite describe The yogurt was not original or memorable but it was good enough that going to another place was not worth the gasThe second time we went there (last night) it was about 45 minutes to closing time  The pistachio was completely liquid the chocolate cappuccino and red velvet came out looking thin and gloopy (like diarrhea) I ended up starting a new cup three times chose a sorbet flavor that wasn't my first second or third choice  The friend I was with noticed less topping available than there were last time  I didn't even feel like yogurt anymore when we paid  Again the guy ringing us out was nice but that wasn't quite enoughThe place needs a facelift a new name (really Yogurt Mart) and more time and quality control needs to be put into the yogurt selection  Yuck.
1887,Terrible CS will never go back Beware of terrible service Bad attitude Would not honor REI's return policy  I will take my business to a store that treats me right They make you think you are part of the CO-OP by buying in what a joke  I have been a member for over a decade and they have lost a loyal customer.
1835,This place has a great atmosphere perfect for dates groups and girl's night I came with my parents for a family dinner We came on a Friday night without a reservation in mid-July and had only a 15-20 minute wait We got drinks at the bar and hung out At some of the tables in the bar area you can seat yourself if they're open A waiter came and let us know which was really nice of him We ended up being beat to the table but we weren't worriedI enjoyed a pomegranate martini It was delicious and I love that they bring you a chilled glass about halfway through Totally unnecessary but TOTALLY appreciated We shared the spinach/artichoke dip as an app Yummy I had the bleu cheese crusted filet which was perfectly prepared Dad had the ribs/chicken combo and thought the ribs were surprisingly good for a non-barbeque place Mom had some kind of salad and it was huge When she was done she barely looked like she touched it We tried the White chocolate banana cream pie it was a little weird Came on a crust that looked like a cookie Dad said it was okay but then I noticed a very small hair on the whipped cream We quietly told the waitress who immediately apologized and offered another Since we weren't impressed we declined She comped the desert and our appetizerFood was great drinks were great desert was just fine Service is where WCG shined We were really impressed with the way the waitress and the manager treated this hair Probably 4 apologies total It was nice to NOT be blown off for a small complaint or made to feel like we were making a big dealI would definitely return Yumm.
2028,All I had was their Sangria so I dont know if I can really rate them or not but based off of their sangria definitely 5 stars Good service also My friend and I got a pitcher of sangria and its house made and the pitcher has a bunch of fruit in it no ice which is good bc sometimes the pitchers has so much ice and hardly any drink I was a fan.
65,Went inside with my boyfriend around 10pm on a Thursday and it was a ghost town Sat ourselves at the bar and waited five minutes Saw two servers walk into the bathroom but no one greeted us and no bartender appeared nobody came to talk to us Left and went somewhere else RED FLAG.
3222,"I saw Beaver Choice profiled a long time ago on Eden Eats and always wanted to try it  I was driving to work one day and drove right past the new place and was so excited  It is literally 3 minutes from my house and about 5 minutes from where I work  Heck I even emailed the owner to ask when it would be open  And got a very nice email back too  So last Saturday me my daughter and my friend went in and got seated right away  The waiter was pretty good too  Good startWe got the fries with cheese and gravy to start  It was ok but most importantly fresh and hot  Then our dinner came and it was a different story  I got the stuffed chicken mashed potatoes salad and cole slaw  My daughter got a hamburger medium and salad  And my friend got meatballs mashed potatoes and cole slaw  The mashed potatoes were cold  My daughter's hamburger was well done and the bun was ice cold  The dressing on the salad was tasteless as well  Not horrible but definitely room for improvementSo we have cold food and an incorrectly cooked meat  But you know what the clencher was  We called the owner over and told her the food was cold  She didn't say a word and walked away never to return  Didn't offer to reheat the food maybe throw in a dessert nothing  But she was sure greeting people with hugs when they walked in the door prior customers I think   You'd think she'd work a little harder to keep new customers  After all wasn't that why she moved to expand her businessGuess what  I live close and also work at a very close and large office building  We go out to lunch a lot  You better believe I won't be back and won't bring any of my friends and coworkers in either   There's never an excuse for poor customer service especially by the ""OWNER"" of the restaurant  A waiter usually nothing to lose  The owner has everything to lose  I hope she reads this."
1375,I LOVE this place The food is always good and I have never had a problem with the staff Their chips and salsas are amazing I visit here wth my family often and its alway been great.
1040,My car AND my friend's car were both keyed in the parking lot here I haven't been back since.
2778,Worst gym I've ever went to The staff is always trying to sell you stuff and the equipment isn't maintained very well IMO I cancelled my membership after 7 months and started going to 24 hour fitness up the road I also had multiple problems with the billing because they always seemed to double charge on the kids club.
4901,I've definitely seen better Motel 6's in my lifetime We stayed for one night after my birthday party at a bar down the road HUGE MISTAKE At 105 degrees out a nice cool room would've been nice but ours didn't work - AT ALL The beds were so stiff and uncomfortable - mixed with the heat none of us slept The bed linens had burn holes (in a non smoking room) and stains that were hard and crusty looking super fresh and unwashed from the last guest Not to mention the stains on the mattress and box spring - SO GROSS We noticed the next morning that there was a ton of gnats in our window - IN THE ROOM I will never be staying at this location again.
4921,"At about 7 pm we arrive a bunch of pilots flight attendants and mechanics/maintenance  about 14 they were able to seat us with in 10 minutes i was stokedwe are all seated outside it was such a beautiful night last night it was soo nice the waiter comes up and says hi but WE had to ASK him his name and he was way to relaxed not very outgoing at all he gave me the feeling like we interrupted his ""Smoke"" break my bad while we were waiting for our food i asked for some bread they brought out a little plate of maybe 8-10 pieces of bread on it keep in mind we all have not eaten since before noon that day and we all looked at the plate like um ok when the food FINALLY came i was soo excited the whole place had smelled amazing since walking up from the parking lot (which was kinda small and packed) but i was quickly disappointed the pizza was soo thin the toppings fell right off the pizza and there was virtually no sauce at all :( the crust was the best part of the whole thing my friend and i decided to get a piece of cheesecake to hopefully save the meal NOPE not even close i almost wanted to cry cheesecake is my all time most favorite dessert and it was ruined the crust was waxy and just gross the cake part tasted a little weird kinda like the crust and to mushy like they didn't give it enough time to set it was awful their menu has salad appetizers pizza and calzones and desert that's it no pastas or anything else so there isn't much to choose from :( their water with lemon was my favorite part of the meal sad Over all The bathrooms were decent Parking was not to greatThe food Sucked Service could have been WAY better and it was WAY OVERPRICED if i ever go back I'm just gonna order Water with extra lemon."
190,Here is a rare but deserving compliment for an establishmentFIVE STARSthat's right this establishment at the Scottsdale Quarters is top notch I decided to go there and have lunch todayand I have to tell you it was fantastic I had the Turkey Burgerwhich may be the best I have ever hadwas fired grilled with lettucetomatoprovolone cheeseavocadoon a Flax seed Bun I had a Kale salad and sweet potato hash as my side dishesno French Fries peoplenot that kind of restaurantLOL(sorry) Now True Food simply means they use locally organic and locally grown productseverything is light but doesn't lack any flavorand trust me it DOESN'Teverything taste great The have tons of gluten-free items on the menuand the honey lemonade I had was simply delicious and refreshing You get one free refill on that and unlimited refills on Black and Green Teaif your a Tea fan If you decide to visit this locale ask for Brockhe was outstandingand I made sure his manger who's name is Kelli (hope I am not spelling it wrong) knew that he did a great job My water glass never got emptyhe refilled my lemonade without me even askingand he checked on us frequently to make sure we didn't want for anythingneedless to say he got a nice tip I could go on and onbut just go for yourself and remember to Eat Drink and be Merry my Friends.
1393,I recently purchased a Ford Focus from Enterprise The whole process was so easy and surprisingly fast They gave me an excellent deal on my trade-in and made me feel very comfortable The car is fantastic and in great condition - I love it.
2233,What a great Greek food place  My girlfriend and I ordered falafel and a side salad plus got a drink for about $8 each  Honestly this place is SO good When you walk in you might think it wouldn't be that good but it made me feel even better  The falafel was great was moist and had a great flavor to it  The pita it was warped in had to be made by this place  It was fluffy and had a great crisp to it  All of the fixing that went into it were extremely fresh and I truly enjoyed it  Then came the salad which I decided over the fries I have never had a salad with so much feta I had to pull some off  Good thing I like feta on my falafel as well so I didn't waste itI will definitely come back to this place to try something else for a cheap meal Way worth it.
2501,We decided to try this place because of the good rating overall on yelp  When we went in we realized that we probably should have kept looking for another restaurant  When you don't see any Asians in a Chinese restaurant on Saturday night it gives you a pretty good idea as to what kinda food they serve  Don't get me wrong though We usually do like Americanized Chinese food  But this place is not for us*Appetizer = mu shu pork with tortillathe mu shu looked like pile of vegetable and meat scraps*Main dishes = oilytoo sweetnot a fan*Atmosphere = full of kids.
315,What a nice experience I took a leap of faith and tried these guys and to my surprise was blown away  My wife has a '79 Mercedes 450 SL and this year the A/C died  We took it to the Mercedes specialist we normally bring it to and after keeping it for 3 days he told us that it would cost upwards of $4500 to fix it  I dropped it off at Auto Air and Electric and they called me back in a few hours with an estimate of $850  I was happy but nervous   After they were done I was happier to find out he OVER estimated and the bill was $25 Less  WTH  When's the last time that ever happens  Air is blowing cold as anything  These guys have my business from now on.
3619,Well you expect some kind of hospitality when you are in a restaurant making you feel at ease Delhi Palace does not have it in them In general the servers sound rude and they don't look happy to serve you As far as the food is concerned it is not what you expect from an Indian restaurant The curries were a bit bland and were very thin for an Indian curry Naan was pretty good All in all that was the first time I went to Delhi Palace and it turned out to be the last one.
1542,Just purchased a used BMW R1200C and was appalled at the dealership prices for regular maintenance services and began looking for a small private bike shop  Was referred to Josiah the owner of Dirtball by a fellow BMW enthusiast  Josiah is BMW certified + works on all other types of bikes  He's fair friendly and VERY reasonably priced  I needed a couple new tires and he ordered them in for me on my word and the price was the same as any super cheap no overhead online motorcyclesuperstore type etailer  He charged a fraction of the cost for install and then even test drove the bike for his opinion on it mechanically he found a loose tail light  He also adjusted my shock to my height/weight  He didn't charge me for the test drive shock adjustment or the tail light tightening  I spend some time in the shop watching him work on my bike and could tell he's very careful with all of his customer's babies  He had several folks drop in and drop off big expensive bikes of all flavors all so relieved to have found him  Josiah is honest knowledgeable and and affordable I highly recommend him.
3129,First I have to say that the food is decent I wish you could review differently for food v service Have you ever been to a restaurant where you feel like you are an inconvenience just by virtue of the fact that you are a customer The staff here is RUDE and no courteous at all The food is awesome and that is why I went there but they really nickle and dime you I ordered the vegetarian burrito and I was told that adding veggies ( TO THE VEGGIE burrito) was more than a dollar extra Another couple said they were overcharged for their chips and salsa The cashier told me that they now keep all of the hot sauce behind the counter because customer will take it Next time I will stick with good ol' Chipotle.
2678,We have been to the Spotted Donkey near the Bouldrs many times and every time the total experience was woderful especially the consistantly great food  On the other hand we have been to the new Spotted Donkey on Hayden 3 times and all three times the food was practically inedible The food is consistantly dry tastless and usually arrives at the table cold It is a beautiful restaurant but I would highly reccomend avoiding the new one on Hayden.
3238,Don't go here I went for a possible UTI and after I gave a urine sample the NP told me she didn't think it was a UTI and that I should go to another doctor for a possible Infection I went to another doctor and found out it was a UTI After paying for the minute clinic and the doctor with no insurance I am out 200 dollars Waste of money and time Go to a Real Doctor.
3572,I do not understand what barbarians all of you 4 and 5-star reviewers were going to before you went to the European Wax Center but I had the worst brazilian wax of my life here  It took much too long hurt much too much left a great deal of hair in the exact areas that should have been waxed I had horrible ingrowns and the hair started growing back almost immediately  This means that the waxer was not pulling the hair out by the root but was breaking the hair off I can safely say after several years of having been waxed in the right way that this is not what brazilian waxing is supposed to be  Save your money and go elsewhere.
2939,To make this easy the best breakfast I've had in a long time Service was excellent and polite We ate there 3 consecutive mornings My only regret is that you have not franchised this place in Chicago We'll be waiting Until that day comes we will have to wait till our next trip to Scottsdale.
3585,This place was horrible  The waiters were decent but they brought us the wrong items and gave us a hard time when we wanted the right ones  The pasta was also inedible and when we tried to send it back after they had taken it away they told us if we wanted a replacement dish we would have to pay for both dishes  We asked to talk to the manager who is also the owner  He refused 2 times to talk to us until we relayed that we would be posting a review on Yelp  Then he came over and agreed not to charge us for the wrong meals which had already been removed  Horrible customer service  And we still had to pay for our drinks and they never offered to send us the right food.
2014,Visits to AZ are never complete without a stop at Four Peaks  Fresh beer great food great atmosphere and helpful staffWe have been to both locations and hands-down the Tempe location is where to go to people watch hang out sip some tasty adult beverages and eat some tasty food  On the weekends it gets packed with people so go early  Scottsdale was a nice place on a Sunday to watch football and enjoy a casual --albeit quite afternoonBoth locations rock  When the Mrs asks to go there (the salads and light adult beverages are her thing) that makes me a happy camperIn support of local independent breweries keep up the great jobHope to be there soon.
2975,"Tuck is certainly ""tucked"" away in the neighborhood that is has landed itself  What a pleasant surprise  When we Looked at the place from outside we automatically knew that it was fitting for what we were looking for small but open and well lit but also good ambiance  There is one large family size table for a party of 10  The rest of the tables are two tops and four tops We were greeted as soon as we walked in the door and treated very well  Now the foodwe started with cheese curds that were very tender and absolutely delicious and very lightly fried The Mac and cheese is amazing There was no real ingredient  that jumped out at us the overall combination of ingredients made this a truly delicious dish  I highly recommend this  We then had the skirt steak which was also extremely tender the rub they used had a slight kick to it but not overpowering It was served with potatoes and lentil combination that was simply delicious The skirt steak was fabulous  We were not impressed with the garlic and bread for $500 and would have been happy with the baguette bread (plain)  but they charged 200 for that Overall I love this place and will certainly be back for more flavor challenges."
3325,Unfortunately this was the worst sushi I've ever had The rolls and other pieces were edible but the mackerel sashimi was simply unbearable and I had the awful salty taste in my mouth for the rest of the day to remind me (a taste so pungent it persisted even after having Mexican food for dinner) wow.
122,Let me give you the low-down on this jazzy place First: the folks who work there are totally non-judgmental Doesn't matter how you dress or what you look like they treat everyone who comes with respect and a positive attitude That goes a long way with a working person like myself who doesn't try too hard to impress and often gets judged for not 'dressing the part' of success When I travel it is often with juicers boxes of veggies a multitude of dogs or even collectibles I really appreciate their fair treatment of each of us who stayed at this great location Really super management modelThe place was beautiful to be in and at clean and uplifting The colors textures even the sunlight coming through the sheers and room dividers brought a smile to our faces The grounds are well maintained the people who work at the front desk restaurants and even the maids are all polite and caring to each who need them I couldn't ask for a nicer stay and will be sure to return only next time with a bunch of friends in tow to enjoy the suites Thanks so much for taking care of us You ROCK Valley Ho.
4286,Quality is awful service is worse.
4044,Just to make this clear on how bad this place sucks for karaoke I am on my iPhone right now while I am here to right a review I got off work at 10 and came by here for the first time cause I heard this place was awesome for karaoke Little did I realize HOW wrong everyone was I walk in and my ears start to bleed The singers were a collection of the worst singers I've eve heard The crowd was mainly made up of people twice my age and I'm 26 The drink specials were decent but the bar was SMALL  There are MAYBE 10 tables in the whole bar I will NEVER come back here unless for some reason I really want to feel better about myself.
570,This was the worst one I've ever been to The service sucked starting from the second we walked in the door No one greeted us or even acknowledged us It took awhile for our waitress to pay any attention to us and I had 2 kids with me I will never again go to this waffle house The only reason it gets a star is because I had to.
1185,Great toasted sandwich The owners are very nice And they have Miss Vickies Salt & Vinegar Chips They are so hard to find.
22,We went for the Thanksgiving Brunch at the LV Bistro I was excited it included tasty food from all of the Fairmont's restaurants But after the experience I had I won't be back I was under the impression that this was a world class resort however the service we received in the restaurant was below what I would expect at Applebee's Don't get me wrong the property is beautiful The valet's were friendly and helpful providing us directions to the LV Bistro where brunch was held The hostess was friendly quickly found or reservation and we were directed to our table where we sat and waited to be greeted by our server for our drink order We waited and waited 15 minutes after we were sat a woman approached us and asked if we were waiting another to join our party as she began filling a water glass We told her were weren't and we had been waiting for a while She quickly turned and disappeared leaving a half filled water glass (and water spilled on the table) behind Another 5 minutes later a server with a tray of drinks appeared and told us he would be right with us He dropped off the drinks and greeted a table that was just sat A few more minutes passed and a female server greeted us and began taking out drink order and giving us the lay of the buffet when the male server returned to see if we needed anything else Once we got our drinks and found the buffet things went somewhat smoother During this time we realized how cold we were It was about 62 degrees when we arrived and the doors of the dinning room were wide open to the buffet outside Those seated outside got space heaters but inside we got sweeping breezes Not what I would expect from this type of setting I would be much more understanding if the restaurant was busy but when we got there at noon it wasn't In fact countless staff members wandered around the floor diverting their gazes from our hungry and confused stares I wanted to alert the hostess to the situation but was asked not to by my companions I have been a server so I am understanding but this was ridiculous It's a buffet we only needed to be greeted and get drinks There is no reason we should have had to wait 25 minutes to be greeted I was seriously shocked that the manager and hostess making their way past us repeatedly failed to notice this either I expected a wonderful experience and while the food was good the overall experience fell short I didn't feel that it was worth the $70 price to be neglected and freeze.
2982,Wow  Best sushi I have had in a while  I went here with 4 colleagues after a round of golf at GrayHawk down the street  We were seated promptly and the staff was super friendly  We had close to 15 different rolls some wine and sake   It was the best dinner of our trip and can't stop thinking of how good it was  Highly recommend this place.
2619,Very fashionable interior  Very comfortable   This was my first pedicure and I wanted to go someplace where the employees spoke English as their first language  Also someplace where snobbery didn't abound  Fuchsia is all this and more  Talented staff excellent serviceHowever my pedicure was a gift and I don't know how much they charged  Seems like it would be expensive.
4883,"I brought my car to Allen's because my headlights stopped working They were very nice and got my car in quickly They gave me a quote of $631 for a replacement headlight dimmer switch After the initial sticker shock I decide to research the part myself I found the part online for $199 when Allen's was charging $460 When I called and questioned them about it they said that is what NAPA quoted them Sooooo I called NAPA The price they gave me was $350 (still $110 less than Allen's told me) I decided to order the part and change it myself I feel like they were trying to get more money out of me unfairly My quote from them has an ""other charge"" of $20 on top of the part from NAPA being marked up $110 I'm sad and disappointed that they tried to scam me out of money I can't comment on the quality of their work as I decided not to go use their services All I can comment on is that I feel as though they were dishonest in their part price quote I will not be using or referring Allen's in the future."
3201,After visiting the Glendale store two consecutive days and spending nearly $1900 Store Manager Lane Pate left me feeling less than satisfied with my experience Lane had worked with me both days and was informed that I did not have any furniture in the home I was furnishing yet he neglected to mention that with my bed purchase I would not get a frame After the deal was closed and I inquired about frame set up upon delivery he told me the frame was not included and the mattresses would be laid on the floor He then sent me next door to purchase one from Kevin for an additional $54 more dollars I was so shocked I didn't know what to say and just left Even Kevin laughed and then apologized for making fun of the poor serviceI am thoroughly disappointed that during our multiple discussions this detail was not mentioned particularly since this is a necessary component My intentions were to come back and purchase furnishings for the rest of my home but based on how I felt when I left today I will most certainly be doing my shopping elsewhere.
4146,I have worked in the restaurant industry for years now and normally don't post about restaurants I can be very understanding but this place is such a disappointment  I had to say something First of all I don't know how you can mess up fried tofu (seriously) they chopped up four large pieces of tofu flash fried them without any seasoning and charged $9 for them When we tried them they were greasy on the outside and very raw inside Next we got the wings that looked great in the picture but tasted terrible They were rubbery soggy and super fatty My boyfriend and I could not even finish a few because they made our stomach sick Again $9 The rest of the dishes and the sushi were so mediocre and blah I just cant believe we wasted our moneyI have lived downtown for 6 years and if this place doesn't change something very soon it will not last a summer in this town We called to complain about this terrible meal but haven't heard back from anyone I hope we do but I doubt it.
2403,Best filet in Scottsdale  Best price too  Where else do you get two sides with a great steak  I always do the mash potatos and corn yum  Loaded baked potato is a meal itself too  I've had other meals there all good  Pizza is amazing love provel cheese  Also great wine list  Sit in the bar always freindly service.
900,I usually love Einsteins  I love their blackberry lemonade and their six cheese bagels  However I do not love this location  It is right around the corner from my house I do not even have to leave my residential roads to enter here but I will never go here again  Why do you ask  It is because they have the worst customer service ever  Every time I have been in here (which is about 6-7) they are very rude to me  I do not know why  I do not know if they are having a bad day or what but they are extremely unfriendly here and its not always the same person They lost my business for good.
4153,Mixed reviews- Yes the pizza is pretty good But been there once and had the nacho's cost me almost $20 bucks And yes you guessed it the plate of nacho's with 15 chips and each chip going around plate and each nacho had typical stuff a little beans sum cheese sum lettuce sour cream But you know those nacho platesyou've seen it not a pile of chips just individual chip next to each other all the way around outside of plate It was like $19 bucks and drank water I was like come on I can go too fili b's and get with carne asada on my nacho's and big pile of em for $5 bucks Food is good ie pizza but expensive  For what you get.
1646,Great service great pricingI'll return for sure They didn't try to force an additional sale on me.
4879,"Um is this place a jokeI really don't understand how this place has so many good reviews  I came here because it seemed popular and had a pretty good rating on Yelp but I really don't understand how maybe all the ASU kids are impressed by the modern interior design  Maybe they're sick of their meal plan food  Or maybe people are just hungover and any breakfast food tastes goodAnyways-The service was awful  Not one single person had a personality or even a glimpse of a smile  There was about 20 people ""working"" but doing absolutely nothing  Workers were just aimlessly wandering around the dining room standing behind the counter in a daze or fist bumping their friends talking about how wasted they got the previous night (no joke)-The place was a messThere was food and garbage ALL over the ground  The drink station countertop was a sticky disgusting mess spills lemon seeds used napkins allll over it  The place was pretty busy but any empty table was still covered in the previous customer's dishes and food mess  (Which I didn't understand since there were 3 workers wandering around the dining room at all times)  I had to flag down a dazed employee and ask them to clear a table off for me  And of course he just wiped even more food onto the already disgusting floor  Seriously food ALL over the floor  Gross-The food took forever and was coldWe waited about 25 minutes for a super simple order of food  I got the Farmer's Market  The whole entree was cold  And NOBODY likes cold soggy potatoes  It was supposed to have avocado on it but it had one mere sliver  My boyfriend's food was also cold and he didn't eat it  We would have said something to someone about a refund or getting at least warm-ish food instead but everyone was too busy wandering around in a zombie daze and at that point I just wanted to get the hell out of that disgusting placeAnd there was awful music playing like music that plays really loud in a club  Like loud Britney Spears and hip-hop  It was just weird  I would never come back here and would advise anyone (unless you like cold food disgusting places and awful service) to try another place for breakfast/lunch insteadEw."
3696,"Did everything they could to avoid doing the right thingS&M were responsible for a managing my corporate relocation package in conjunction with United Van Lines last year When our furniture arrived across the country our brand new $4000 leather sofa was scratched up with big baggy indentations and giant grease stain on itI immediately demanded a full replacement since what I had before the move was literally weeks old They responded that their policy was to ""repair"" the goods but to the contrary they provided a full replacement fee for all the smaller (cheaper) itemsWe agreed to allow a local ""professional"" leather company do the repair work and they only removed a few of the scratches The grease stains and the dents were still present and they even added new damages in transportation including ripping off one of the foot casters The repairs ultimately cost S&M $1750 and when I told them that it was unsatisfactory work they claimed they had fulfilled their contractual obligationsI ended up having a separate hearing (as per the contract to resolve any disputes) and despite providing both photos and written accounts of the poor service and damages S&M were somehow deemed to have satisfactorily repaired my sofaNow come to write these reviews and I find that ""Advanced Leather Solutions"" who performed this terrible work have consistent 1 and 2 stars on Yelp for poor service and even worse customer serviceI am so incredibly frustrated since in the long run it would have probably been near enough the same cost for them to just replace the sofa and we would have all been happy But as I stated they went so far as to use their legal team's time and resources to fight me to justify this terrible service which only added to their costs in this processWhat a waste of a year."
2921,This place has a very retro feel I love the big booths and the entrance is kinda cool(you walk through the kitchen) Great place for a martini for me and a huge steak for the man in my life :).
111,I'm a fan of this small family place My husband and I love to go here and have dinner Their special hummus is always impressive  My husband tells me that their lamb cannot be beat I've had a bite of his and always found it to be very tasty  I've tried so many things on the menu and have never had something that I didn't enjoy  They offer a wonderful happy hour and one weekend a month they have a belly dancer in.
2914,This place does not honor reservationsMade a reservation via opentable and specifically requested Teppenyaki only to show up and be told we had to wait 2 hours Can't speak to tonight's food quality because they decided not to serve it to me.
4141,I went to this restaurant yesterday and paid two meals with drinks When I arrived at the salad bar I was dismayed to find pasta smeared on the serving tray I dug through the whole pile and didn't find a single clean one I then looked at the plates and began to pick them up in every stack of plates and they were ALL greasy had food on them and smudges of black oil of some kind on them My hands were greasy just picking them upI called for the manager and demanded my money back immediately and requested that she have all the plates and trays washed The help and manager started picking through looking for an occasional clean-ish plate When I saw this happening I told the manager that I would call the health department if she didn't remove all the dishes immediatelyMy concern though is that all the food dishes may have been contaminated in the same manner If you got sick there let me know.
4209,Worst place ever No credit card machine no ice no pizza Close the doors already.
37,I have had two bad experiences Call me stupid but I'm trying one last time to support a local business We'll see how it turns out Check back No disasters from last visit but I'm not going back.
3470,"Past memory said this place had the atmosphere we were looking for at breakfaststill does  Server was GREATthat's where it all ended  After we ordered food we saw lots of food going back to the kitchen  hmmmm  The our order came  moth my eggs and hash browns were not cooked as requested (yet on the receipt it stated properly)  rather than send back my whole meal asked for a plate as they wanted to recook the browns  they instead later brought out another plate of them and explained that was the most well done/crispy they could be  and they were not  as if they could not simply leave on grill longer  eggs were to be over well were REALLY runny and went all over the plate  We dealt with it did not want to cause more issues in a kitchen clearly having issuesFYI the gravy might look good but tastes like thick flour paste  avoid this  put in on a biscuit and a country fried steak and basically I'm burping up bad flour for a few hoursfinally got the bill  they chose to do nothingwe ordered bloody mary's screwdrivers had a nice tab  they really messed up the food  simple told the waitress that she was great but the kitchen let her down  was disappointed they chose to not do anything for us based on the issues  She explained she could not but she took to managerManager comes out and wondered why we did not go to her since the waitresses ""don't have authority to do anything"" she had attitude over it  nicely put  she looked at us and after I explained the issue she actually stated ""but you ate most of it right""  OMG  We re-explained we saw all the prior issues with other tables and dealt with it but did tell the waitress at the time  She comped us a cup of coffee  WOWTHANKS  $50 breakfast tab and a free cup of Joe  well done  Turns out this lady is actually the owner  I told here she should fire herself  She couldn't understand why I would say such a thing  I explained how poorly she handled the situationnot to mention that the food was wrong (and simply not that good)  Frankly me never going back is punishment enough  I'd avoid this place  And especially avoid the manage/ownerrshe's not pleasant."
1721,Guess what I try the Gyros and I got hook  Fresh and tasty  Home like environment They also provide you with free refills and WiFi  What a deal  Give Pita Kitchen a try you Got nothing to lose.
4842,Awful awful awful  Tickets said 5 PM so we got there for 3:30 so we could get set up early  The parking lot doesn't open until 4:30okay  So we figured we'd kill time and got some food  In the meantime the lines to get in the parking lot become a clusterfun  Finally open the parking lot gates  And now time to wait in line to get in the actual ampitheater  We were front of the line so we were talking to the security ladies who were nice  Then they couldn't figured out if gates opened at 5 or 5:30  Some may complain about the cell phone policy but that was the comedy acts rule and not the ampitheater rule from what i can tell  Gates finally open we're excited to get to our lawn seats so we can set up and get comfortableoh but the lawn doesn't open until 6 PMwhat  So we have to walk around with our blanket and bag for another hour  I guess that will force us to buy your overpriced beer and food  Only two acts were going to be on the main stage and the rest were going to be on another stage () but no one we asked seemed to know where this stage was  It was frustrating so realizing we only paid $20 each for the tickets we decided to leave about 15 minutes after we entered the gates  The disorganization was to a level I have never seen before  The whole experience was horrible  I can't think of any event that could drag me back to this hellhole.
782,The ambiance was promising when we all arrived  It was suggested that the prime rib would be the best option so I ordered the 7 oz medium (using their menu-rankings and descriptions as a guide) plus the usual sidesWhat I got was essentially steak tartar with a millimeter-thick quick sear on the outside  On first bite I wasn't sure what I was eating so I had a second  Then it became apparent that the middle of the steak was not only rare it was completely raw  basically refrigerator-cold to the tongueSo steak sashimi not being what I wanted I waited for the server to return  This didn't happen so I got up and went searching through the restaurant to no avail  I finally just stood in the middle of a busy intersection until one passed by and explained the situation  He could not find our server either so agreed to take it back for 'reheating'A few minutes later someone higher up came and apologized and said another would would be right up  The rest of our party continued to dine while I sat there with no dining whatsoever no refills on water/drink etc  About 20 minutes later my food arrived (45 mins after ordering) and everyone else was most way through theirs  With wine glass completely empty no service for refills forthcoming I proceeded into steak

2524,Fish tacos 24 Hours You now know everything you need to know.
516,I'm a big fan of Fox restaurants already but Modern Steak did not disappoint The boyfriend took me here for my birthday and we had a great experienceIt was a Saturday night and I was surprised at how not busy it was We chose a nice table out on the patio because it was a warm evening Even though the patio is right next to the parking lot it's relatively covered so you still feel like you're in the restaurant and not just sitting in trafficWe both ordered filet mignon I was very happy to see the had grass-fed beef You don't see that too often and it's a much better choice than grain-fed so yay Modern Steak for offering that For our sides we ordered the mushrooms and the onion ringsThe steak was delish Done just right to each of our liking ad a nice-sized portion The onion rings were tasty served with BBQ sauce The mushrooms were a nice compliment to the steak My the end of our meal we were stuffed and satisfied When the boyfriend made reservations he mentioned it was my birthday so they brought out a free dessert A very nice touch for sureThe most impressive part of the night came at the end We both had steak left over so sent it back with the server to be boxed to go She came back to our table and told us my steak had accidentally been thrown out and offered to have a fresh steak cooked for us to take home I was blown away that they would offer that instead of just saying oops We of course took her up on the offer and enjoyed the leftovers the next dayHigh marks for the food service and atmosphere Modern Steak was the perfect choice for my birthday dinner.
638,"Ive been twice now and keep forgetting to add my two cents  Had fairly low expectations as you don't hear much about Verona Chophouse and I've lived in the area for about 20 years  I am always leery about ""upscale"" casino restaurants as most are really hit and miss - especially those in Vegas with celebrity chefs' names attached to them  Our first trip was well beyond our expectations starting with a salad that appeared to be plucked from someone's garden to the perfectly cooked and seasoned filet  The service was perfect but a little odd in a good way  We expected a refined and polished server with a side of arrogance typical for a joint like this and what we got was a ""motherly"" type woman who was not only attentive and knowledgeable but also caring and went out of her way to make us comfortable with a bit of a dry sense of humor  What a nice change of pace Second trip demonstrated that the first wasn't a fluke  I opted for the Veal Chop and my wife the Filet  This time the Filet was unimpressive and a little smallish and perhaps overdone but the Veal Chop was outstanding  It was huge and so well-prepared that I had a hard time feeling sorry for my wife's sub-standard cut of beef  Thankfully it was big enough for us to share and we both left satisfied  The service was again fantastic and we were taken care of by another woman who valued delivering real service and comfort over playing the stereotypical server role  This trip we noticed the doors to the beautiful outdoor patio were open and a band of some sort was getting ready to play  Sidenote: We originally chose the Chophouse because Shula's at another casino just a few miles away was booked  It is really hard for us to find value in Shula's after dining at Verona Chophouse  Sure Shula's can be great but by my estimation you will pay about 30-40% more there and you could still get an average meal and crappy service  AND there is no way in hell Shula's could make a Veal Chop as good as Verona."
450,This restaurant really is the type of place where you feel at home It's run by a wonderful couple who make the food from scratch daily Try the lasagna if you're hungry it's fabulous.
4111,"Wish there was a 0 star option My mother in law got a manicure and gel polishthe tech that did her nails left gel polish on her skin and didn't try to take it off when she mentioned it to him I got a pedicure and it was not relaxing at all My nails weren't filed evenly and there was polish all over my skin When the tech was done painting my nails she immediately put my sandals on and told me to go pay I asked her if they were dry enough and she said ""probably not"" I wish I would have saved myself the $25 and gone somewhere else."
1252,Awesome Mexican foodChilaquiles shrimp ceviche tortas and all of the tacos were delicious Oh and their tomatillo salsa was awesomeI didn't care for their horchata it lack flavor.
3771,By far the worst cupcake shop I have visited yetIf you like duncan hines or betty crocker cupcakes and frosting this is your place that is exactly what the cupcakes look and taste like  I didnt even finish mine and that is shocking for me I adore pastries I threw the rest of mine in the trashI dont see how they stay in business sad but true.
924,All of my friends were asked what we want to drink the second we got in the door: They wouldn't let my friends nds who walked in together each have their own tab We had to use one card and break it later Then one girl wouldn't USE my tab: she had the gall to say she' isn't psychic' and said I have to tell her I want to use my tab before I order Ive never purchased ANYTHING where I have to say how I want to pay before I order it Pretty terrible and annoying experience overall.
2813,Worst experience yetFor a highly acclaimed and talked about restaurant the place was revolting and an utter disappointment Now to be fairthe ambiance and atmosphere was very hip but the hostess and waitstaff were rude and unprofessional Even simple things like requesting a refill of a glass of water fell on deaf ears Our particular waiter was a complete moron who could not even remember his own name let alone an order And the food was over priced and under flavored In summary there are far better ways to burn your money.
2850,"I can't say enough how much I love this daycare My son has been going to MVCP for over two years now I knew from the second I walked in that I this was the place for us My favorite thing at first was that they only had I think space for seven babies total which meant my little guy was going to get a lot of personal attention Instead of feeding the babies like an assembly line like in some of the bigger daycare facilities we toured they actually held the babies when they fed them Each baby has their own crib and their own cabinet so you can bring your own snackies and stuff He has since moved up to the toddler room (soon to go in the ""big kids room"" as he calls it) and its still just as awesome The teachers are INCREDIBLE They are constantly doing projects and teaching them so much I just found out last week my son can count to ten in Spanish And now they are working on counting to ten in Chinese It really is the next best thing if you can't be at home with them probably even better since they get to have the socialization and interaction they wouldn't get at home We were so lucky to have stumbled upon MVCP."
2514,Always helpful Great staff I never feel pressured to reserve things here unlike the other one on 51st and Indian School.
3533,what a waste of time service was the worse I have had in ages food was so so there are so many better places to go that care about the costumer will not go back.
917,I had lunch here today with my mom and I was pleasantly surprised The food is really good and reasonably priced Of course we had to try a cupcake so we split a cookie dough cupcake and it was to die for I can't wait to go back and try another flavor The staff is really nice but honestly my favorite part was the music - Elliott Smith Beck Radiohead Beatlesit doesn't get any better than that for me I could have sat there all day listening to my favorite music while eating delicious cupcakes :).
464,we hired cameron to be our wedding dj from the first time we met him we knew he was the right dj for us he was chill but we knew he would keep the party on track he had tons of experience a reasonable pricing structure and a super friendly and helpful demeanor it turns out his schedule-keeping skills were mighty important on our wedding day the wedding ceremony was over an hour late because of rain and subsequent hail during the time we should have been exchanging our vows we flip flopped the cocktail hour and the ceremony to allow the rain to clear cameron played cocktail music told our guests to grab a cocktail and appetizers and as soon as the rain let up they'd get to see a wedding awesome i didn't have to worry about a thing except perhaps the rain letting up which it did but now back to this review i'm a last minute kind of girl even when it came to the wedding and cameron was not bothered by me a bit i called him 3 days before the wedding with my latest brilliant idea - a wedding video for my husband's grandmother who wouldn't be able to attend i was in luck - robbie the videographer was available and we added the video to our contract at a really fair price cameron knew my situation and he could have charged me double because at that point i believed i really needed a video but he did the fair and honest thing instead i like a business man with ethics continuing my theme of last minute decisions we were still selecting songs to play during the ceremony the day before the wedding asking questions and generally being a giant pain in the ass being the accommodating wedding dj that cameron is he took everything in stride helped us make the final decisions and never showed even an ounce of annoyance toward me if i were him i would have strangled me the music selection he had was extensive and fun and he was happy to add to his collection with a few off the wall selections we just had to have he rocked our party with energy and class until the venue made us leave and everyone had a great time 5 well deserved stars.
2705,"Can't even bother to elaborate Batting cages are horrible nuff said look out in the baseball ones as they throw pretty crazy and the softball lanes are pretty non-accurate nor are they consistent  The balls are really hard so don't bring a bat you wanna not crackThe karts are shitty even for lame little kid karts Food is super gross didn't play minigolf or gamesPretty lame for a ""fun"" place."
2197,These guys great at customer service and first impressions These guys have excitement when they talk to the customer and act like they enjoy their career.
192,Pho-yuck this place I was tricked in to going here with promises of great Vietnamese I was ready for a culinary adventure and what I got was a ride in the fright house The B√°nh x√®o was so greasy I couldn't eat it it was literally served on a plate of grease The bun was about the same It lacked flavor the rice noodles were slimy the spring roll was loaded with grease I ordered some sort of plum soda drink and it had a cup of salt on the bottom of the glassThe service was horrible and I will not be back.
617,If you love authentic Italian food in a festive holiday atmosphere La Stalla is the restaurant to try They have an extensive wine list and they give  you enough  wine  to enjoy the evening We were a party of 8 on a Friday night and the service was superb The wait staff were helpful friendly and efficient My minestrone soup was warm and delicious  The grilled salmon was prepared well and served with steamed veggies that included cabbage  I love steamed cabbage but since  most restaurants tend to overcook cabbage La Stalla stole my heart My group also ordered the lasagna and sweet potato ravioli These dishes were made with fresh ingredients and well presented  The desserts were delicious but my all time favorite dessert was the tiramisu La Stalla Cucina is a great place to take your guest during the upcoming holiday.
2065,Still head over hills for The Mission  I have even made a pit-stop on the way home to kill my sweet potato fries and grilled street corn craving (I know carb overload)  They just added a few new things to the menu one of which is the black cod loved it (hopefully that can help balance out my love of the carbs)  Be sure to make a reservation because the cat is out of the bag on the locally owned gem.
3753,"I CAN""T BELIEVE THIS PLACE  First off every time we would take our animals here for their routine shots etc we NEVER got to see the vet  All we ever got were high school looking kids with huge gage earrings torn jeans and t-shirtsreal professional  Today I received a call at work from my girlfriend who was crying hysterically  She said that something was wrong with Bailey our schnauzer  She said that she was acting very very ill  I told her to take Bailey to the vet which this vet is the closest  She ran in and was told by the lady behind the counter that the vet was eating lunch and could not be bothered and after lunch he was going in to surgery so she should just go find another vet  Are you flippin' kidding me  What a load of trash  We will NEVER go back and I hope you don't either."
3333,Very poor service  Went in for late afternoon lunch (3:00) and the restaurant was less than half full but looked like a good number of servers working  We were sat at a table and there we sat for 10 minutes without ever being acknowledged by any of the servers that walked by our table - after 10 min we walked out   Good service isn't hard people - it's not rocket science.
2860,"Long time customer I walked in ordered some food to go I guess they are doing a new thing where the cashier gave me three lids that were for small salsa cups At salsa bar I wanted more I put some salsa straight on my meal instead of the cups and a worker (instead of talking to me nicely he right away treated me like some criminal) scolded me for that because ""to go"" orders (even though I came inside to order it) were only supposed to get three small cups of salsa Huh If I decided to eat there then I can drown it in all the salsa I want but not if its to go They had plenty of my business in the past but will not in the future."
3229,"ok so I read the bad reviews on here but I still wanted to give this place a try since it's a new place for revloving sushi Also I wanted to compare and see if it was better than Teharu Sushi in Tempe Well I was not impressed at allThey really need more variety of sushi rolls The whole time I was there I was just waiting and hoping to see if different rolls would be coming my way but NOPE it was the same california roll salmon roll or vegas roll just rotating in circles I don't want to be eating the same rolls over and over So because of thismy friends and I ordered sushi off the menu Each roll it took them more than 30-40 mins to make And this place wasn't even packed There were total of 3 sushi chefs in the kitchen making sushi tooughI think I was at the restaurant for a good 2 and half hoursThe sushi itself was nothing special I only liked one of their roll and I only saw that type of roll rotate around onceHonestly I would not go back here ever againIf you want the whole ""revolving sushi"" experience go to Teharu Sushi just sayin."
1540,Pizza Bianco has the best wood fired pizzas  The wise guy and bianco verde are a great combo  Make sure to add mushrooms to the wise guy for a taste sensation.
954,Impressed with this strip mall alley dive bar I love the Hoot Owl Best part they have extremely clean restrooms for men and woman Great service and great deals.
820,Had one of my favorite breakfasts ever here while in Scottsdale last weekVery filling bowl of steak eggs and veggies Since switching to the Paleo diet eating out often leaves me unsatisfied but I could barely finish this breakfast and the taste was a 10 out 10I strongly recommend for the healthy on-the-go crowd.
1026,Artie responded to my message within 5 mins and proceeded to walk me through the repair  After a few failed attempts I threw my hands up and asked Artie to come out to my house  Based upon my schedule Artie was able to schedule an appointment for 6:00 pm that night which I appreciated With most other plumbers I would have had to wait until the following day just to get a returned call  Artie was punctual polite and cleaned up after himself The price was right as well  I have already given his contact info to a coworker who is in need of a good plumber  I will definitely call Artie in the future.
1206,I used YELP to find a Mexican place with a good rating when we were in town THANKS Yelpers This place is awesome  Really cool gun place next door too.
3042,You would think this is a good place to live then you actually move inMy room was always uncomfortably hot and the A/C would do nothing and if you turned it passed 74 degrees it would freeze and then not work at all it would take hours to defrost and then it would drip a gross amount of water all over your carpet Not only did we have cooling issues but heating as well no heat for a month in the winter The guy would act like we were crazy leave after ten minutes then it would start blowing out cool air They had to call in specialists and one of the workers stole a marc jacobs necklace of mine At first I just assumed I left it somewhere else in the apt and it would turn up (how ever I remember taking it off in the bathroom which is right in front of the ac/heating unit) now I am moved out and it was no where to be found and I only wore it twice so I know I didn't loose it After I moved I sent an e-mail stating what happened and I even said in the email I am not looking for compensation for it I just wanted to inform them that it happened and be a little more aware of the people they hire I got a not very nice e-mail back from the manager to not accuse her employees of that and that it was impossiblethen I explained they had to hire outside works to fix it her response ya so what do you want me to do about it(She completely missed the point)  They have a trash policy that they do not keep up on unless they feel like it I left my trash out for a few minutes while I was moving and they charged me $75which is annoying considering they never enforce it unless they feel like it Also they will sign for a package for you but if someone else picks it up or if the driver doesn't leave it they are not liable for itkinda annoying when you order uggs someone gives it to the wrong apt and your out $14000 I placed a work order the first day to have our carpet fixed because it wasn't installed right and these metal  prongs stick up and poke your foot I placed this work order twice and I'm pretty sure I stepped on it when I was moving out My boyfriend also lived their and they charged him for re grouting a shower if a shower needs to be re grouted that is because the building is old and shouldn't be a $200 charge on his account The pool is constantly littered with people whom don't live there it used to good for college students now there are kids everywhere My roommate dropped her keys off and they claim they never got them so they charged $10700 they also charged us $32000 for a new carpet how ever nothing was wrong with it when we left it only needed to be cleaned which is normal I can go on and on with stories like this but I'm not trying to write a novel here don't be fooled by the pool gym and computer room It's not worth it.
1016,(Revised 2/26/10)- - - - - - - - - - - - -Early 2009:I bought a huge bank-owned house for a song & didn't need 18 rooms for myself & my cat so I went to work doing a major remodel on the place to carve out some apartments to rent out  As the $1000s started to pour out I set up some books to try to prepare for 2009 tax time & soon realized I was in over my head with the accounting (if not with the whole project)  Of course I came here to Yelp to find helpI was impressed by the 5-Star review I read here by fellow Yelpie John S for Michael Gallacher CPA so I called over there  Gallacher's nice assistant Brenda set up a convenient appointment for me & I went inAlong with John S I found Michael Gallacher to be both immediately likable and completely knowledgeable  In about 45 minutes we got me on the right track to prepare for 2009 tax time  I brought a list of questions which were all cheerfully & clearly answered & the whole session went just right  My cost to straighten out the mess my books were in & get everything set up properly was a reasonable $125 & it brought me a lot of peace of mindI left Gallacher CPA completely satisfied & confident that I was now keeping my records properly for tax time  5-Stars==================================================9/22/09:I dropped in to Gallacher's office unannounced with a different IRS issue  Michael Gallacher was out but I was greeted warmly by the receptionist & then seen right away by Michael Bosen another partner in the firm  Just as with Gallacher I found Michael Bosen to be completely likeable & knowledgeable  On top of that he jumped right in to solve my problem even though I had shown up without an appointment  The fee for the new service I needed was reasonable & it's 5-Stars for Michael Bosen too==================================================January 2010:Once I had all my W-2s & so on I brought them in along with the books & receipts for 2009 that Michael Gallacher had me keeping & piled them on his desk  My complicated situation called for THREE Federal & TWO state tax returns to be filed with all kinds of extra forms & so on  I don't think I would have gotten it anywhere near right trying to do all this myself  We talked for a few minutes Michael cheerfully took on the task & everything was ready to go in just a week or so  They were able to able to electronically file most everything too & now just a couple of weeks later I have received my tax refunds  I can't overstate how happy I am using Michael Gallacher & this firm.

4024,Valley Metro used to offer student passes to my college This summer they got greedy and failed to make a deal with my school So if I bought their summer semester pass it would cost $40 more than if I just paid full-fare every day Taking advantage of full time students who have no income is just as shameful as preying on the elderly on fixed income  SHAME ON VALLEY METROValley Metro used to be a convenient way to read on my way to class in the morning Then they made the trains shorter with only 2 cars instead of three Now there are more people paying full fare to ride the train but they haven't increased capacity so everyone has to stand all day long They say they aren't making enough money to run more trains but more people are paying full fare than there was before (it's a hallow excuse) SHAME ON VALLEY METROValley Metro devised a system to pay for your ride by pre-paid train passes but if you forget to activate your pass outside the train as you're running to catch the train you could get a $500 ticket Just to re-cap even though you've already bought your pass in advance you can still get a $500 ticket -That's a ridiculous system  They could have allowed us to validate our tickets on the train in case we're running latebut no it's better to hassle people on the train with their lame security detail (Gestapo) who get their jolleys interrogating average people  SHAME ON VALLEY METROThe sign says it takes a half hour to go from Tempe to Phoenix on the light rail That's complete and total hog-wash no matter what time of day it is I live 1 mile from the train station on an average day I expect to spend 15 hours each way on my commute It's a 55-65 minute train-commute into Phoenix from Mill Ave to Indian School Add on the fact that  I usually wait at the platform for about 10 minutes because even though they are supposed to come every 10 minutes they never do Then add because the intersection is a gauntlet at Indian School (because of the train station is in the middle of Central ave instead of one side or the other) it takes me another 10 minutes to get from the train to my building across the street Why -poor planning SHAME ON VALLEY METROThen there are times where the trains are overloaded but they don't send 3 car trains to fit all the people Examples: Central High School lets out the same time every day and 300 kids flood the train Baseball games downtown cause a flood of the train When there's an expo downtown I can't get on the train in the morning because it's too full the trains run slower and I'm late for my 8:30am class (when I leave at 7am) Valley Metro fails to consider it's environment SHAME ON VALLEY METRONO I'm not thankful of having a train that hardly goes anywhere and costs too much BETTER transit is everywhere (except LA)   BART has been in San Francisco for years and is cleaner nicer and cheaper You only pay for as far as you ride So you only pay for what space you actually use If you go one stop everyday it's not expensive at all The Buses in Seattle run clean on electric lines on some streets and are much more efficient than anything we use in AZ In Sydney the buses are more efficient because they run the traffic lights so the buses don't have to stop at them The Valley Metro system is lame and costs too much SHAME ON VALLEY METROIt's our own fault for voting for people who pass useless laws and can't balance a budget to save their lives AZ has been putting mass transit on the back burner for decades If you want more tax dollars get the working class to work on time efficiently SHAME ON THE AZ VOTERS AND VALLEY METROALSO the light rail could prevent people from driving drunk by operating just a little later If the trains operated until 3am all the patrons of Tempe and downtown Phoenix night life could get home safe no worries Instead we pay (taxpayer $) for expensive DUI checkpoints It's a simpler solution that's more efficient and will encourage patronage of local businesses Keep the train on later so it's useful and PREVENTS crime  SHAME ON VALLEY METRO and the silly police departments with reactionary tactics.
3550,Can't customize and the smoothie I got lacked flavor Plus it took forever and was expensive.
1000,Absolutely DE-LISH   I was throwing a bridal shower for my vegan cousin-in-law and luckily found this wonderful bakery  I sampled the cupcakes a few weeks before the event and fell in love with these great cupcakes  My fave - and the HIT of the shower - were the Boston Cream cupcakes  I will definitely be back  The owners are wonderfully kind and deserve support of the community  I have told and will continue to tell everyone I know about this place.
4791,This would be the ideal stop if you were on a scavenger hunt because any and all pop culture trash has been stuck on the wall shelf or is hanging from the ceiling or parked outside  OMG hoarder heavenThe food was okay yet i ate very skeptically half expecting a cockroach to climb onto the table  I actually liked the hamburger  There were wings too but i'm not a fan of those - soaked in enough sauce i'll eat though There are skinny carrot sticks with thin and runny buttermilk dressing for dip on the side of each wing order  There were families at the next table with a whiny child and dad yelling at her for most of our meal - how annoying was thatIt appeared there was only one restroom for everyone and we chose not to go there to wash our hands of all the wing grease and sauce.
733,I only gave this 5 stars because that was the limit My wife and I just had a one-to-one meal with the Head Chef Claudia His passion for food is incredible the man is a geniusThe experience was $65 per head I defy anywhere in Scottsdale to match this for value for money.
2723,Came here 6pm almost every table taken up no seats at bar Ordered dolmathes and calamari which were reeeeally good I've been to their Goodyear location for their gyro which compared to others found in west valley is A++ Service was really good too always checked on Will come back and highly recommend.
797,The best ice cream sandwich in town and (for future reference) they deliver What's not to likePlenty of adventurous flavors if you're into that sort of thing and if you want the usual suspects (I'm a mint chip aficionado) you'll be pleased I'm going to be back A lot.
3307,The money-gram service fee is $14 meanwhile at Walmart only $9 They using a phone call instead if a filling form which is I have to repeated the questions & the answers many times They only accepted cash not debit card So when I have to take the cash from the ATM near their door it charged me $3 I had to do it coz I have no time to find Walmart  otherwise I preferred to go to Walmart It suck.
2071,We chose Mastro's on a whim last year when we were AZ for Spring Training We had such a great experience we decided to go back My husband and I shared a delicious shrimp cocktail and ordered the petite filet which was melt-in-your-mouth perfect Brussels Sprouts were excellent But then I nearly passed out--through NO FAULT of the restaurant When I became dizzy the staff stepped up to calm and care for me Paramedics were called and I was taken to the ER If I was going to have an emergency this was the place to do it Everyone was so concerned and caring The manager called the next day to see how I was doing That being said I'm disappointed we didn't get to stay to for dinner as the food at Mastro's is superb.
4058,"DON'T EAT HERE Looked nice from the outside There were over 12 empty tables 2 couples waiting and still we were told it would be a 25 minute wait Decided to have a drink at the bar We were the only 2 people at the bar and it took 5 minutes to get a bartender (as my English friend once put it ""If i don't have a drink in my hand in 30 seconds the bar is s**t"" Finally seated 30 minutes later Very soggy edemame clam miso clams were chewy and the sushiI'm no sushi expert but we ordered 3 different rolls and each tasted slightly sour and ""rank"" Even the ginger had a very sour aftertaste To top off things we only had water and my glass stayed pretty much empty despite the waitress promising to fill it up right awaythree times And they didn't bother to clear off the dirty drink glasses something that should be rudimentary considering their drinks are over priced Overall poor service poor food qualityobviously not the only ones thinking so as the facility was more than half empty which should have been a clear sign to stay away DON'T EAT HERE."
1134,I also want to add my very positive feedback about my experience with Josiah and Dirtball Customs  I took my 2007 GS to him for some minor servicing that I just couldn't get right (throttle body synch and the related valve adjustment) and he not only did those services for a very fair price but also looked over the bike very carefullyThanks again Josiah  Your prices are fantastic for labor and I will see you next month when I replace the tires on my GS.
2161,My parents stayed here and thought it was great and so I thought I'd try it too After a really horrible day of car trouble and such a long drive the staff was super helpful and made me feel so welcome They really made the day much better and I cannot say enough about their customer service The rooms are also nice too which of course is great I'm sure I'll stay again and will recommend it to anyone who comes to Phoenix.
4149,Wish I had seen prior reviews about microwaving the food would never of gone  Ordered Bean & Cheese Burrito $425 (not worth the price smaller than average) Cheese Enchilada $250 3 Rolled tacos & gauc $525 (taquitos) Rice and beans $225 ea $19 total  The hot sauce was watered down no flavor but hot  Everything was in warming bins the food tasted as it been there for a while Should of taken the clue when we went in around 6pm and there were no customers  Would not go back Ever.
11,I Love LOVE this place- and while I currently live in Chicago next to the Baron of Japanese Markets- Mitsuwa I love this place even more Although it is not as large as Mitsuwa and doesnt have the same variety service is spot on and the prepared foods are deliciousI ended up buying a nigiri plate and an unagi dish served on rice.
1792,This place sucks balls I can't believe it is still open I went here one day while I was installing a alarm system in a house around the area Took them 45 min to bring out 2 slices of pizza by that point i was going to walk out the door blandest pizza i have ever tasted i don't know how this place is still open never again horrible service horrible food.
2225,Atmosphere is great great location amazing food too My chicken was awesome but the best part we're the donuts for dessert This place serves food really late too.
1522,Vienna Beef hot dogs best around and the stay is always the same always so realLove the place.
1432,I finally tried the Pepperoni Last week This was fantastic Original crust crunchy Pep all the right stuff.
1383,"Just went here last night for the first time after a visit to the museum and it was everything I had heard and more - i was not disappointedbeautiful historic home turned upscale-casual restaurant in the style of Coup de Tartes or House of Tricks It was relatively busy but we were sat right awayMom had the BBQ chicken BF had pork tenderloin (I'm not a pork fan usually but this was melt in your mouth delicious and not overly salty at all) and i had the meatloaf entree (not sandwich as advised by the young and very pleasant server)we were all very pleased with our orders and service was prompt professional and pleasant the woman dining next to us came as a recommendation while in town from the owner and chef's cousin she asked the server to let him know she was here so she could meet him and say hi and after the crowd died down a bit he did and seemed like super cool down to earth guyi overheard him mention his ""other restaurant"" so on our way out i asked him about it he was also super friendly with me and filled me in on Circa 1900 (which I've also heard lots of good stuff about) i will be heading there on my next dining adventuredinner entrees were priced between $15 to $25 cheapest glass of wine was $6 (not bad the food was couturely presented and tasty)ps the parking lot was a nightmare all dirt and full of HUGE pits and deep tire tracks but wouldnt stop me from returning."
2211,we had a fantastic meal here with great service food and ambiance  we will be back.
2930,The best gluten free veggie pesto pizza ever So good Was there with a bunch of yoginis and well just assumed I'd be hungry by the time we all left but the pizza was amazing and hit the spot Took the 1 tiny piece I had left to eat laterThe service was excellent and so patient.
3781,Talk about horrible customer service Their pizza was horrible and drenched in grease It took 10 paper towels to get some off it off They have horrible attitudes  towards customers and talk down to each one when customers don't enjoy their food I've worked in 5 star restaurants and would've gotten fired on the spot if I treated a customer like they treated me  Beware This place is the worst place I've ever been too I would take Peter Piper Pizza over this crap.
3492,If I could negative stars I would I bought a GroupOn originally came in for visit They sold me on $99 full body contract I went for several months no real complaints Then in November Simplicity cancelled my appointment and rescheduled without notifying me until after this Once I get a call for new appointment time I tell them I cant do that time The rep on the line said well we are busy till late December I said so you are going to charge me $99 for a service I didn't receive She said well I can add free month to the end of your contract I did not feel like arguing with her about how that is not how you handle this situation Later December comes around for my appointment and I get a call at 10:10 am saying you miss your appointment I said no it is at 3:00 pm The lady on the phone said well sorry we cant get you in now I call 1/2 because the billing department was closed for the holidays I get a hold of a lady and she said sorry it was our fault We can offer free month at the end of the contract I was like OMG how is this acceptable practice If they were getting charged $200 and no service wouldn't they be upset So I tell the lady to issue a refund to my credit card and cancel my contract She said she would have to look into that I called my credit company after that call and requested a charge back and STOP on any future charges from this company NEVER AGAINReviewing the treatment: This is my first laser hair removal I have notice a thinning of hair going there for some time now But I am not impressed on how I still have lots of hair I would think I would be bald by now but just thinning.
3384,Bummer Was so looking forward to have great wings with my girls Hair in water (tap water)glass dried food on platefood on the floor under the table order was wrong and wings where gross Never coming back.
2292,People who live in suburbs understand the necessity of having a car Because metropolitan Phoenix is a super-sized suburb all residents understand the value of having a car In fact a lot of people have to drive to park-and-rides to use what little public transit there is here Unfortunately cars take a beating go through wear and tear break down and in sum can just be a real headache One night I noticed my car needed well over a hundred feet to brake The Car Shop fixed my car and said I had one broken brake line and the other was swollen They were fast professional and the staff was quite likable It was a very reasonable price to fix both brake lines and they did a little extra work on it at no charge Next time (and there will be a next time) my car has problems I'm taking it here.
1228,I can't remember eating better carne asada or even a better bean burrito this side of the border Wash it down with a Mexican Coke and it's heaven Notes: Interior is very small maybe 5 tables total (but there's a patio) Service was very quick and friendly Parking is easy and free.
4878,Went to Zen for lunch today with a friendwaited at the hostess station for a server to seat usno one camefinally the chef said we could sit anywherewe sat downwaited ten minutes for a server to come to our table to just even bring us water and menusnever happenedwe got up and left without ever seeing anyone They only had about 10 customers on the patio and NO ONE inside but usthis was sadwe saw servers walking in and out and a few even made eye contact with us but none approached us Very sadplus the place smelled like bad fishthis place has gone way down hillsad Worse service ever.
3102,Very disappointing After reading the great reviews posted by others I purchased a groupon for 5 visits Needless to say I will not be making a trip back The idea is nice but the construction of the little town is very poor and in need of a face lift and new carpeting It was packed with kids but there seemed to be very few toys in site My daughter went to play in the little grocery store but instead of baskets of fun fake food there was nothing in there but a broken plastic cash register Everything looked worn and dingy and we left after about fifteen minutes.
4519,"I used to enjoy coming to this place but my experience this past weekend prompted me to sign up for Yelp and write this review  When I came here a few weeks ago I figured the horrible service was a fluke but the ""too cool to notice you"" staff this weekend confirmed the disappointing turn in customer serviceHere are the ""highlights"" of the night:1  Picked up friends from the airport and arrived at Gallo Blanco before 10pm2  Asked for a table for 5 and were told that the wait would be 15-20 minutes which was not a problem for us3  10:20pm:  decided to change the party number to 4 since one friend wasn't able to make it anymore4  Seated a few minutes later to a dining room and patio at 40% capacity  Really5  Menus and water brought to the table6  10:30-10:35pm:  Staff consistently ignored my fianc√© who was trying to track down our server since we were ready to order  During this time we saw other tables being tended to and waited on7  Walked out of the restaurant  The hostess servers and other staff failed to notice or say anything as we left It's understandable if the restaurant was busy but the dining room was practically empty at the time my fianc√© was trying to get someone's attention  Maybe it's because we're Asian but I guess the staff felt we didn't deserve the attention they gave to the other cool hipster people there that night  I felt awful for bringing my friends here and wasting their precious time on their quick trip to Phoenix  Thanks Gallo Blanco for wasting an hour of my life  Your food is not good enough to deserve a repeat visit."
1088,This is a five star for me  I am an artist that has participated since day one  I have watched this artist showing grow from the beginning  It is great for several reasonsthe artists are new and innovsative the bands all along the walk give it a great groove the people that run it really do care  I wouldn't miss it either as an artist or attendee  You will find something special that makes great for you too.
3029,What a pleasant surprise  I have worked in many fine dining and restaurants that put an emphasis on pairing foods and sauces that compliment each other and being recently transplanted to the Scottsdale area I am very pleased to find this jewel  First this place starts on a great foot by letting you buy wine next door at about wholesale prices because all great food has good to great compliments of wine  I am used to the smaller portions and having many of them my date and I both got the 4 course tasting menu allowing us to sample many of there plates  It was a couple of weekes ago that I dined but standing out still were the endive salad OsaBuco style short rib and an amazing apple and fennel dessert  I was very pleased to have found the Atlas Bistro.
2586,I can't believe I hadn't reviewed this place before I'm shocked and disappointed in myself Gelato Dolce Vita has been a favorite of mine since long ago (okay like five or six years) I lived in Queen Creek and whenever I went to Mesa to visit my friends we would inevitably end up here Every flavor is amazing and the owners are super friendly It really is the best gelato I've tasted outside of Italy And you know even some places in Italy didn't quite measure up Maybe I'm biased Who knowsJust trust me Check this place out That's my advice The end.
2335,Great service Very welcoming and great tasting bagels.
1150,First best Cosmo in town Seriously Poured on balls of dry ice which keeps it cold not too sweet and they leave the shaker so you can finish it off Love the garlic toast in the bread basket The tuna tower on the appetizer list is enough for an entree Great steaks and seafood selections and don't forget the double pork chop But the creme de la creme is the Butter Cake - not to be missed.
3790,"From the street my husband and I thought Zoe's Kitchen would be like Panera - that is we thought it would serve fast flavorful and good-quality lunch fare None of these adjectives turned out to be an accurate descriptor In fact the food at Zoe's kitchen took 30 minutes to come out and was disgustingly bland and in a few cases quite gross We stopped in for lunch last week The place was packed but the line to order moved quickly so we incorrectly assumed that we would also get our food quickly More on that in a second In terms of the menu we were shocked at how uninteresting the menu options seemed Even though the menu was decently sized and we are open to lots of different types of food and flavors we found ourselves completely unable to choose and not drawn to any individual option Even though I'm not a vegetarian I prefer lunch sandwiches with no meat so I was also quite irritated that the only vegetarian sandwiches were the grilled cheese and grilled feta This is 2008 and the non-meat options at a lunch spot should be more imaginative than cheese slapped on some bread In the end I still ended up ordering the grilled cheese (nothing else sounded good) and my husband selected the Greek Chicken Marinara We sat down at the table displayed our number card and just waited And waited And waited After literally waiting for 25 minutes I checked in with the assistant manager who was manning the pick-up counter She went into the kitchen checked on our order and said it would be just a ""few more minutes"" She even had a server bring us two slices of chocolate cake as some sort of  token of their sympathy but it was super-dry and totally gross Thanks but no thanks I'm just glad we didn't pay $2 for each sliceIt wasn't until 10 minutes later when I lost my patience and told the same server that we wanted our food immediately that we finally received it We have a higher-than-average awareness of the difficulties of working in food service but we found it un-acceptable that a non-full-service restaurant would take 35+ minutes to bring us two sandwiches If they can't handle the catering to-go and eat-in order volume they should hire more staff members As if the slow service wasn't painful enough my grilled cheese was completed charred (literally burned and black) After one bit of the accompanying slaw which was soaked in mayonnaise and soggy I  immediately walked back to the assistant manager handed her the plate and asked her to refund me for my plate To her credit she complied but the wait had already been so egregious that I wasn't about to just write the long wait and gross food off and decide to return My husband's Greek Marinara was not as terrible but was still bland and completely un-memorable The bread was a plain roll the chicken breast strips were formed and tasted totally processed and the ""Greek"" marinara tasted like Prego The only tasty part of his meal was the side of bagged chipsI guarantee you that we won't be back to Zoe's Kitchen We are huge fans of fast casual and fresh lunch food but we found the food at Zoe's to be anything but."
2796,Great atmosphere I love the (fairly) new expansion and bar area The cocktails are some of the finest you'll get in Phoenix If you're looking for a good drink try a Modern Fashioned or a Kindness Yvette Or just tell the bartender what your favorite liquor is and they'll mix you up something great.
2868,Best auto and life insurance Had several situations due to a auto claim and Brian Stevens always saved the day Will be a State Farm customer for life.
220,I'm ashamed that I haven't left a review for this place yet I've eaten here for a good while and I've never been disappointed with the food Well there was this one time but it was because it was sold out I'm okay with that it tells me it was really popular that night AnywayThe prices are good the teas are good and it's just fun to sit in the pews while watching the candles melt Every friend I've brought here has had a good time with an equally good meal I'm a sucker for the royale with cheese and a side of thousand islandYou know what look at the average review score I really think that's the most telling part of this place Really Go Eat Enjoy.
4665,"YUCK Craving Mexican food so my friend and I decided to stop at this place for some burritos We were impressed with the large selection at the salsa bar When we got our stale store-bought rubbery chips the salsa wasn't so appealing after all We both ordered chicken burritos and were shocked when we got a basket with a tortilla filled with soggy chicken bits and bean soup It wasn't possible to use a fork and knife in a basket so we tried to pick them up and the burritos spilled all over our hands It was a mess I asked the waitress to look at the menu again because we were not satisfied with the burritos I hate to waste food but we could not force ourselves to eat them She said we had to pay for the burritos and then she would give us ""one"" taco She made us feel very uncomfortable as she waved her ""one"" finger in our faces so I told her we would pay for the food and then look at the menu again She immediately brought me the check and waited over my shoulder for me to pay for it before she handed us the menus Her angry attitude scared us so we no longer wanted to look at the menu We just wanted to leave and try out another restaurant I would not recommend dining at this place The quality of food was horrible and the service was even worse Waitress with vile attitude and crappy food equals a no win situation You're better off dining at Taco Bell."
3822,Service was horrible Need to teach servers how to turn tables prebus etc.
812,Place was clean and not busy at all for a Saturday Pizza was good compared to chucke e cheese.
1303,Staff was amazing There was a wide selection on the menu and everything was high quality The red snapper is what I have and it was delicious my husband had the Chilean sea bass and he loved it The restaurant itself was beautifully decorated and very comfortable We will return and we highly recommend this restaurant.
296,This is a awesome coffee shop in downtown Mesa Great place to grab a cup of coffee and hang out They have a awesome patio and good stuff to munch on if you are hungry Staff has always been quick friendly and very welcoming I'd recommend checking them out.
2992,Went here for fathers day waited ten minutes before we were greeted Had to send back mushroom burger because Roy was cooked at the wrong temperature and had a stale bun Although the manger was very understanding to the situation and pod for the burger it was an overall bad experience.
2956,Waitress was awesome n I had the new chopped steak burger it was good n my bf had the royal red Robyn it was also good fries was awesome.
2362,Don't go in here if your black They will be extra rude to you The wait was longer than I expected so I changed my mind Wife wanted to stay so I went back and reserved a table for 5 again She claims I said 5 She did that to be nasty And I think because we were the only black family there.
3955,Where to startmy bf and I went on Father's Day We were told up front things would be awhile but did they not get the memo they were working a busy Sunday holiday Unfortunately our waiter was embarrassingly terrible he was nice but he clearly did not care he was messing up our order and just about any table near us We were patient but he literally messed up everything from start to finish He forgot to give a soda to my bf didn't charge me for the coffee I did order (which fine w me) but the food took wayyy too long and they brought me the wrong thing They also forgot the one egg I ordered then when I asked they brought me too (again a mistake they made in my favorsweet) I ended up sending back the incorrect order and at that point I was so hungry and over the place I just asked for a muffin It was dry and disappointing The check took forever to get too Would not recommend and never going back Dottie's is a hot mess.
2323,I had found fish taco shan gri la I passed by this place a few times since moving to a new office but I'm always skeptical about corporate sounding places trying to look like local food joints This place wows and is definitely a good local find I went with the fried fish taco ($299) the mixed fish and shrimp taco ($350) and a shrimp quesadilla The fish was SUPER fresh and light They serve the tacos bare and have all the fixins you could want to pimp out your taco They had 4 different salsas ranging from mild to super duper hot quite a few sauces like chipotle avocado and cilantro plus onions cilantro lime and just about anything you want All in al a great meal if you're in the mood for fish and shrimp tacos.
1780,"When I need a good mexican food ""fix"" and I'm at work I go here It is just down the road & it has always been good I always get their chicken tacos They hit the spot Plus I gotta say their chips & salsa are pretty delicious as well Yummy food."
4589,Phoenix Sky Harbor I've seen your plans for light rail connecting the terminals and the rental car center and they look glorious 2015 can't come soon enough though --- the rental car center transportation (and the rental car center itself) as it is now is the worst I've seenWhy is it the worst you ask- the shuttles from the terminal to the RCC and from the RCC to the terminals wait until they are mostly full to leave which means you could be sitting on the shuttle for 15 minutes before it even gets moving Other airports have no problem keeping their shuttles in the move- there are a lot early flights out of PHX (like get to the airport no later than 4am flights) and there are hardly any staff around at that time so everything us slower than usual The last thing I want to do is get up even earlier to deal with that- the garages are massive and not well signed You keep driving and driving in it trying to leave or return your car thinking did I miss it Until 8 minutes later you see a sign with tiny lettering pointing you in the next directionAll I can say fellow Yelpers is that I wish you luck and recommend you build an extra 30-45 minutes if airport time into your trip if you're renting a carThe airport itself is fine Not a huge airport the food options are regular old airport food options The baggage claim/ticketing/security areas are all fine Nothing special or awesome but no real complaints The nice thing about flying through PHX is that there are rarely flights delays due to weather.
2153,2 catfish burritos (one grilled one fried) and 1 basket of cajun popcorn (crayfish tails)OMG Awesome The two catfish burritos are surprisingly different With the fried fish you can really taste the deep complex flavors of the rice and beans With the grilled fish the blackened catfish flavor really steps up to the front Either way this is the best cajun food I've had--I'm no expert though--my taste buds were in love.
657,"I really like the food at Grimaldi's and the service in the dining area has always been excellent However service in the bar area is disappointing at best It's a regular spot for me and my clients simply due to location But I'm not sure I will frequent it again After repeatedly receiving horrible service I think I will find another spot where my business is appreciated The past 3 times I was there the bartender girls ignored me I was seated at the bar with clients I had to yell across the bar to order a glass of wine we had 3 drinks each and each time I had to get her attention this way to get a drink Not once did she ask- "" Would you like another drink"" Also I had to fight to get her attention just to get refills on water tooWhat really bothers me is that this is a service oriented business We are great tippers I'm in a business where good service is handsomely rewarded Do the bartenders there not realize this I'll never go there again Either management needs to step up their game and train these girls properly or risk losing regular customers."
2437,We'd heard about this hotel for years and decided to try it on our anniversary We checked in and got ready to go out for dinner  I had decided to pay for dinner with a credit card so I consciously left my money (about $250) with an expensive money clip in the room (my mistake)  When we got back from dinner the first thing I noticed was that the beds had been turned down  We hadn't expected anyone to be in our room and my first thought was that I had left a lot of money on the desk I went to check and the money and clip was gone  I called security and they came to take my report and search the room  They said the computer indicated two employees had entered the room when we were out and that they would interview the employees  Not surprisingly the next morning they said the employees denied taking the money  The hotel didn't offer to do anything for ruining our anniversary or compensating me for the theft  A week later a manager of hotel called me at home and asked if I had found the money  I told them of course I hadn't found itone of their employees had stolen it  She then offered to send me $200 to compensate me for my loss  That was better than nothing but considering they ruined our anniversary and I lost the  money clip my wife had given me on our honeymoon 23 years ago it was small consolationOh yeah the hotel is old tired and run down  They couldn't pay me enough to go back.
1179,This is a very cute little place with delicious ice cream It is old fashioned but not as kitschy as Sugar Bowl I met the owner and the three young people that were working there they were all friendly and nice to my kids I usually always go for chocolate or mint chip but I tried their cinnamon and it was to-die-for My kids (who both happened to be dressed in Superman capes) had the Superman ice cream It was a pleasant experience The only thing I was disappointed with was there was no changing table of any sort in the restroom which is pretty much a must-have for a family-friendly establishment.
1329,My husband and I have been here many many times and usually meet up with old friends for a few drinks at least two to three times a month We like that it is a small dive bar and located near out house However there have been many disappointing visits The wait staff is NOT friendly or inviting One blonde waitress in particular is extremely rude We patiently waited for her to come take drink orders and/or bring a menu finally we just flagged her down  for a menu She seemed irritated and threw the three  menus on our table My husband asked the bartender about the special $2 shot which is posted on the wall He ordered three $2 shots for then when we received our tab he charged us full price When we asked about the price it the blonde rude waitress started yelling at us and said she doesn't care what is posted on the wall she's not giving us the $2 special We have given this place many chances and every time we are disappointing we decided this place was NOT worth our money nor our time Skip it and try another bar.
4510,I have tried this place a couple of times because it is conveniently located but I wont be going back  The first time I went there were 4 people in line ahead of me and it took 15 minutes to get my coffee  The second time I went I ordered a vanilla latte but they forgot to add the flavor shot  The coffee was not good enough to make up for the bad service.
3009,While I don't really buy a whole lot from here I love walking the aisles of bulk goods  They are very reasonably priced especially when it comes to food  A huge bag of spinach for three bucks  A large container of organic raspberries for around four dollars  Yes please  Also we have a kitty with asthma and the vet told me that her prescription would be around $60-$70  Well my deal-finding spidey senses told me otherwise and I stopped at the pharmacy and found that it was only $27 there Win  I also make good use of my Costco membership at the pump because while other gas stations are advertising gas at over three dollars a gallon I was pumping for $299/gal  I like that they have more than just food and house supplies they have electronics a photo developing department movies/dvds/blue ray books flowers personal hygiene items perfumes a cafeteria pet supplies and more.
3193,How can a fellow Yelper rate this as a 5 and me a 1 Maybe it was an off dayThis place is absolutly beautiful The service was average to slow considering I was 1 of 3 tables The chips were bland and the salsa was crap If you took strained canned tomatoes and added an onion powder from the dollar store and a little salt That was the salsa Totally crap I ordered the appitizer combo thinking it would be a good way to sample a little of everything that was the thought it had a mole` type covered enchilada with chicken in it The mole` was decent but it was very sweet no spice at all Maybe this was dessertThe rolled taco things had zero flavor the chimi was alright but anything fried with sour cream on top is The sope or whatever was ok but again had zero flavor the beans had zero flavor the cheese which I think was Cojita was good but not enough on anything I really liked the decor but would have preferred the chicken from the guy cooking out front of the store Totally disappointed I think this is my first 1 star for a business that is still openlol.
4789,Me: Do you have Sierra Nevada  Bartender: No Gone before I can request an alternative  Angry service and moderately busy  Don't go hereUpdate - looks like they had a change in beer selection and service since my original review  May revise after a few more visits  They actually carry more than the domestics now  I had a Guinness last visit.
379,I love this place I often bring my 4 year old and 2 year old here and they always have a great time They love the playtown as well as the art and puzzle rooms They sell snacks and drinks for very reasonable prices which is a nice plusThere are also several pricing options -- punch cards one time passes yearly memberships which I appreciateThe new owners are super nice and friendly They always take the time to make parents and kids feel welcomeThey have recently started offering special activities such as storytime art classes etc as well I took my older daughter to the princess tea party which she absolutely loved There was a princess on hand to make balloon animals lead the girls in dances and paint faces There were also princess themed activities as well as lots of delicious food that parents and kids could both enjoy My daughter and I are both hoping they will have another princess tea party soon.
4353,They were out of everything I wanted to order and I was getting frustrated and I could tell the cashier was as well-she seemed to get a bit irritated I would go often if they had everything I wanted on hand Seriously-they were out of hemp seed (thats one on the list) how is that possible Lol.
401,Out of a lot of fish especially for a Sunday lunch  The sushi after we received it was subpar it kind of tasted old and had a sticky residue on it  The onlyGood thing I had was the goji roll which was fried shrimp sirracha and other yummy things  I eat sushi all the time and coming here made me feel like I knew more Han the Mexican making it.
71,Before I start my review here's a word of advice: Do not go to Yasu if you're short on time It can be hard to get a table at this little place and the service is kind of slowThat said the food here is amazing I love good sashimi and the salmon sashimi here is delicious The tuna is pretty good too My husband loves the Yasu roll which is tasty but giant and therefore challenging to eat All the rolls are good but in my opinion if you're the kind of person who only likes sushi if the taste is covered up by spicy mayo and eel sauce you might as well save your money and go someplace with low-quality fishThe thing we really go to Yasu for is the black cod You have not lived until you've tried this stuff It's cooked in a buttery miso glaze that compliments the fish perfectly I've had black cod and butterfish at other restaurants but nothing has ever come close to the black cod at Yasu This is a melt-in-your-mouth little-slice-of-heaven kind of treat We always order two when we make the long trek up from Mesa to eat at Yasu.
1358,This is a great restaurant  The hummus is silky smooth and is perfectly seasoned  It also had an interesting flavor that sets it apart (and above) other versions I have had at other restaurants  Several flavors of hummus are available  The grape leaves are tight warm rolls that have a nice mint flavor  I also tried several sandwiches that were very good  I will definitely make it back for dinner to check out the entrees  Great service great prices - it is nice to have a quality Mediterranean restaurant in the neighborhood  It is locally owned and operated too which is nice.
2337,Saw this restaurant on Diners Drive-Ins and Dives We had to go The food is excellent spicy and it's awesome that the vegetarian section is just as large as the meat section Some of my favorites are the Palak Paneer( freshly chopped spinach greens (palak) cooked with home made paneer (cheese) Aloo Matar (Potatoes saut√©ed with green peas seasoned with house spices or the Vegetarian Thali ( 2 vegetable curries and one lentil served with rice naan yogurt and salad)You can't go wrong at this place Everything is good If you don't know what to get just take a chance and you won't be disappointed.
3262,"My Consumers experience and observations: I first went to the Celebrity in 1973 to see Gordon Lightfoot Over the years I have seen many other concerts there and enjoyed myself I have got to say this venue  has changed considerably and it needs major refurbishing Also I have some safety and security concerns We went to a concert there this past week for Pepe Aguilar ---- and have not been there in about five years The sound system is inadequate for the acts they are presenting and the seating is very poorSafety and security issues -  my opinion At about twenty minutes into his performance - we still had the same group of intoxicated young women standing directly in front of us and would not sit down Most everyone else had set down in the area  At first I asked nicely and they started to give us a hard time  I did raise my voice once because it was so loud There was no presence of any staff in the area we were in I walked down and no one was in the entrance area I went back to my seat ---- and the women started yelling - ""See We Set Down""  then the situation escalated a bit with them dropping a few F bombs directed at the both of us ---- and I went down stairs again - and had to get all the way to the bar area before I found a staff member - I told him there is no one from staff in our area or proximity -- he said he would get a manager ----- Went through three different people before a manager showed up - and he took me outside - I had told him what was going on ---- and he said I needed to read the back of the ticket ---- and at a venue people can stand and there is nothing they can do about it  ---- he then said my behavior was scarring him ---- and wanted a police officer to talk to me ----- I told him I was not going to leave my wife alone ----- He would not let me back in until I spoke to an officer - He did have someone go to the area to make sure nothing happened to her The officer who showed up did explain they had no control over people standing up He was very polite  I asked to have someone from staff go back with me to my seat ---- so the small group would know ---- I was complaining about them --- The staff member  told me there would be someone in the area (they were there for about ten minutes) and one of the staff members apologized to me and apologized about the lack of numbers on the seats ---- that is another issue --- apparently they are painting and the seats or aisles are not numbered - at least in our area When we first came into the venue ----- I asked someone for assistance and they took me to the seats - then some other patrons tried to kick us out ----- demanding the seats until they finally figured it out they were wrong Another issue about safety ---- there is no aisle lighting - making it very difficult to get out of the areaRegarding the standing up issue ----- another review here mentions that - the theater  would not let people stand ---- and kicked them out I guess it depends on the show I am concerned that there is not enough staff to safely manage a variety of issues including enough people to escort individuals to the correct seats Also I believe the manager - went overboard talking about my behavior - I made no threatening comments or gestures ----- If there was a problem with my behavior - clearly I demonstrated I was trying to resolve a situation by seeking assistance which was difficult to find That was part of my frustration This establishment needs a remodel the facility and make sure there is staff available for guest  assistance  And --- according to management - there apparently they have no control intoxicated individuals that won't sit down and let others enjoy the show  Fortunately the young women finally  left us alone ----- but we left early so there was no chance of them harassing usMy recommendation to management for a more rewarding customer experience:1 Have more staff on duty to deal with customer service issues - or manage staff better to have all areas covered At minimum the venue should have one person covering each seating section at all times to deal with a wide variety of issues This could eliminate many problems2 Be more sensitive to customer complaints Management could have offered relocating customers if there is a problem (if seating is available) We had to sit through the concert worried we would be harassed3 Install basic aisle lighting for increased safety of the guest4 The current seating needs to be replaced with more comfortable seats and or more room between the seats in front of a patron ----- If I had not had an aisle seat - I would have had to crunch my legs up against the seat in front of me -- and we know how that would have gone with that group in front of us :)."
1142,Sprouts  Happylots of organic and natural foodthey tell you where their produce comes frombulk productsI'm not sure why I don't shop here every week.
848,"Wow  So I just got home from my first ""foot massage"" I was very surprised at the level of service I read reviews so I had an idea that they started with your head and arms then went to your feet But didn't realize it was also face and then after the feet a full back massage  I was a little surprised when my masseuse climbed on my back but it was well worth itI originally came here because my feet were numb after a weekend of dancing in 6"" heels in Miami - and now I don't think I will ever go to a ""normal"" massage place again  I am totally hooked."
1268,Wonderful modern Mexican food  We had the guacamole with pomegranate seeds and it was amazing  The pork was also incredible -- slow cooked so it literally melted off the bone and needed no knife  Service was a little slow but I think that's because the place was packed  I am a patient person so I didn't really mind  The food was out of this world so I can't imagine fussing about the wait staffI would definitely go again and would bring more friends next time.
978,Best managed Subway anywhere The staff are very friendly and very fast Try a veggie patty sub with avocado next time you are in the area.
98,Bombebero's you've won my five star rating I am now a regular for breakfast the last dish was the Uruguayo - Spanish chorizo diced tomatoes roasted red peppers cotija cheese fresh herbs and a splash of chimichurri sauce I can't even describe how delicious this dish is The Spanish chorizoyou use is top notch You've won my heart and my five star review for being the perfect place to dine any time of day You are great to bring out of towners you want to impress with your patio Your cheese selection is fantastic and your overall ambiance unbeatable I think I may go today.
4641,Food was disappointing and ridiculously overpriced  The whole restaurant reeked of charcoal/mesquite and not in a good waywe should have known the food was going to taste the same  And it did Awful  I'm all for a burger grilled over hot coals but when that is ALL you taste on a ridiculously overpriced burger with ala carte sides that you have to pay extra for and you leave smelling of burning mesquite then that doesn't lend me to wanting to return  And I won't  The cheese on the burger was absolutely disgusting a rubbery smoky nightmare  Stay away from this place  Not even service could save this place  If Jasper's couldn't survive in this spot this place doesn't even have a chance.
4827,Dr Rebbelke is the worst doctor ever Very rude and suggests hippy alternatives No one goes to doctors for hippy alternatives Front staff also pushed multiple people in front of me extending my wait to an hour past my appointment time Why bother having appointments if your walk ins get priority.
1675,I love this CSA They have always given me more than what I bargained for Now we can add on bread beef chicken eggs and dairy SO AWESOME I rarely need to go to the grocery store because of this I've never received anything rotten In fact everything has lasted MUCH longer than store produce  For the cost I believe this is the best CSA out there Also i don't feel guilty about throwing the left-overs in my composter since it's all organic.
1653,Upon first look Pearl does not look like my type of place  Trendy location/atmosphere often equals mediocre  food Pearl is an exception to the rule The sushi is creative and tasty and the drink specials rock I love that they have different flavors for edamame cheap bombers and did I mention the fish sticks are way to good All of that would equal four stars in my book fifth star is given to the staff Steve is the type of bartender that others should aspire to be like Knowledgeable and observant without being intrusive Always goes the extra mile I really appreciate how he makes my husband and I feel so comfortable Overall great value and relaxed attitude.
4433,"Arghh where do I start Well allow me to say that I am not a big fan of Macaroni Grill but the hubby and the kids seem to like it so we go there once in a whileCome to think about it I think we have gotten better service consistently at the Agua Fria and Tatum locations we also went once in Mesa However the few times I have been to the Gold Dust locations huge disappointments Once our daughter's wheat pasta was uncooked and missing the pine nuts (we ordered it because she didn't know what they were) We like the Chianti BBQ Steak and we have had it at Tatum location deliciousWe went to this place for Christmas Eve and we were expecting them to be busy To our surprise we didn't have to wait that long to be seated We got a booth (4 of us) and ordered fetuccini and  Penne Rustica for the kids hubby the Chianti BBQ steak and the Parmesan Veal Chop for me We ate one piece of bread We asked for one more We ate it Our server apologized for the delay Long wait Our server came back and apologized again Long wait Our server nowhere to be seen  Over 50 minutes went by since our order which I think it is beyond a reasonable delay We caught the attention of our server and asked for the managerAfter a while a manager stopped by and explained they had 2 very big parties (he mention the number 17 each I think) in a back room Honestly in my mind this translated to 'we do have customers more important than you' we said this was beyond reasonable and were considering leaving he said being Christmas Eve everywhere would be busy and we would be better off waiting here he offered a discount and left I tried to get his attention to ask how much longer but he didn't hear me or else About 8-10 min later he brought our food As he was leaving I said  pointing to the Chianti steak: this should have prosciutto and crostini 'and garlic dip' added my husband He said the prosciutto is in there and left Well in my mind I translated that as ""I am in a hurry so I am going to treat you like an idiot' That is the utmost disrespect and hence the one star There is no discount that makes up for that There was no prosciutto in there At all We caught the attention of our server and mentioned the missing ingredients and he brought a side of prosciutto some garlic dip and a piece of bread nothing like the crostini we have had at the Tatum location Also the veal chop is usually huge and this time it was like half of what I usually get somewhere else Also sadly this still may be an improvement because last time we ordered the Chianti steak here they didn't even believe us it was supposed to come with garlic dip honestly geeezz can't they read their own menus oh well no more Gold Dust in my macaroni ever."
1118,Bopped in here for the the 'Monday Night Special': flatbread and a bottle of wine for $19 Yay dealWe enjoyed the pancetta and asparagus flatbread with caramelized onions added Scrumptious We also ordered the tamarind drumettes with sweet chili sauce The place was hopping and our seats at the bar provided a cozy perch to people watch and enjoy our munchies You know when you first meet someone and it may be too early to tell but you think it could really be something special That's how I'm feeling about Timo I hope it's love.
2492,My favorite Mexican food I always order  a machaca potato and extra cheese burro The cheese quesadillas and tortillas are delicious too I like to wash it down with some of their horchata I am not a fan of eating at the restaurant as it's a little ghetto but it is very clean I recommend calling in the order since it gets really busy sometimes.
4370,The seating is horrible The service was even worse  It feels like they are geared more for Take Out  There was enough staff but no one seemed to know what to do aka refill my Tea glass / take my order / and the no silverware thing again  2 of the 3 things I ordered from their menu they were out of (Mole and a dessert)  Then the waiter tried to talk me into another dish by saying it was his favorite  Will never go back  Sucky experience.
4635,Don't know how this place stays in business  Portions are beyond small One pretzel the size of Starbucks new pretzel is $995 (really)  Steak salad ($1695) is good but not as an entree By the way not considered an entree if you are using a discount voucher  Server argued with me because I presented  the voucher without checking with management  A sure kiss of death for a Scottsdale establishment  Great location I can only hope a more customer service oriented restaurant takes this place over One star for location only.
1274,Love this place so clean so friendly great place for waxing and nails.
3344,VEGANS AND HEALTH FOOD PEOPLE BEWAREI have a fair amount of legitimate food allergies so of course I get to be the wonderfully annoying soul who gets to ask the kitchen what is in everything So much to my surprise I learned that every single one of their salad dressings has sugar in it why I'm not too sure but according to their cooks that's the case Even the quinoa is cooked with chicken broth and the lemon sauce that is pre-mixed into it has dairy in it SO EVEN quinoa which should be a no brainer on the vegan front is in fact not vegan The salads which should be the healthiest option are laden in sugary dressings It'd be nice if they really sat down with someone who knows their business on the health food and vegan fronts and stopped making asinine decisions like putting chicken broth on vegetables and making all salad dressings with sugarAlso if you are going to put on a front of being a health conscious restaurant your employees should be prepared to get a lot of questions about ingredients from the truly health conscious.
2673,For a great reasonably-priced hotel very centrally located in Scottsdale Hyatt place ROCKED  I stayed here for work during the week since I have a certain budget to stick to and was pleasantly surprised by how wonderful the staff and experience was  They have a small cardio room for a gym but offer a full LA Fitness gym access if you show your room key (highly recommend) The staff is so so helpfulthey go out of their way to show you around make you feel comfortable and it even includes a yummy free continental breakfast  Can't go wrong.
4108,This place is overpriced and has mediocre food We asked for separate checks when we entered and after we ate they told us we couldn't have separate checks Itried to talk to the manager but he just walked away This used to be a great place but when they went to full service  raised prices and took some of their best items off the menu it became just another overpriced restaurant that couldn't care less about customer service.
4132,I'm utterly terrified of this store I opt to drive a few miles to Frys instead.
2991,We had the two bedroom two bath suite It was quiet clean and great amenities The front desk staff has excellent customer service skills We were told that there will be renovations to upgrade this already fine place Loved the easy breakfast and fun happy hour that is complementary.
876,I don't normally expect good service from a chinese retaurant unless you're at a chained restaurant like PF Chang's But this place is the worst both food and service The younger gentleman with glasses at the counter is really rude I was recommended to this place by a friend who said it's the best Chinese go to for him since he always do a take out order Recently a young gentleman at the register screwed up his order as well Funny story was I was talking to my boss about Chinese restaurant and he mentioned Iron Chef where he took his family We ended up talking and find out we were treated the same way from the same guy We laughed it off and made joke about it all the time now.
4492,If I could give negative stars I would One of the used car salesman hit me with one of their cars After being cited by Phoenix PD he proceeded to lie about who owned the car and what insurance was responsible Later after finding out that Auto-Europa actually owned the car and was responsible I tried calling to get insurance information I spoke with Jason who was rude and dismissive and refused to give me any info so now I have to hire an attorney to file a civil suit If this salesman Joseph Pratt and the owner/manager Jason are any indication of the type of service and sales it's my duty to warn everyone of their scumbag practices.
3875,Good food worst service on earth   Staff has no idea what is in their food   Manager argued when we got bill with multiple errors   Too bad we will never go back because of horible experience because food was pretty good  Walked out shaking our heads at how poorly trained the staff is.
3847,"Carefree Resortnot my choice  I can ""care less"" about this place  Rooms smell like a sewer and the employees are not friendly  I hope I won't be returning."
862,Excellent food and friendly service  Excellent value and great atmosphere.
1531,All of their food is great Servers always have an opinion on what you should try if you're indecisive and they're always spot on Bartenders are fun and always attentive but not too in-your-face Great place to catch dinner and/or drinks with friends or family.
742,Is it possible to have a crush on a coffeeshopThis place is by far my favorite new discovery in ages  I've been driving past it on my way to and from work for ages but never had the time to stop in  I have friends who rave about the place and go regularly so I really wanted to check it out  I finally did this past Saturday (5/31) and I scolded myself for not having done so soonerMy friend and I found a parking space out back in the tiny parking lot and walked in not really knowing what to expect  One patron sat at a table with her laptop and the rest of the place was empty  The friendly girl at the counter took our orders and gave her own recommendations for cool drinks  I took her up on her suggestion of a peach smoothie  It was wonderful - like drinking pureed peaches  I took a sip of my friend's latte and knew I would be ordering one of my own at some point in the near future  Before taking our drinks my eyes lingered over the cupcakes on display I must admit I drooled a bitBecause it was such a nice night we sat outside and enjoyed our drinks  It wasn't long before more people showed up  A group of older folks joined us outside and a few other groups and couple settled inside  My mind kept going back to the cupcakes I saw earlier and I ended up going inside to buy one  My choices were vanilla red velvet lemon and strawberry (I think)  Not only were the cupcakes quite sizeable but they had sprinkles - goldfish and piggies  Very nice touch  I ended up selecting a vanilla funfetti cupcake with bright blue icing and goldfish sprinkles  It wasn't anything spectacular - just a cupcake made from a box cake mix - but it was a very nice treat and that much more special due to the fishies  I know - it doesn't take much to make me happyI've since been back twice and have used the very convenient drive-thru  The first time the man who came out to greet me asked if I had my stamp card after he took my order  When I told him I didn't he told me he would give me one and he did - along with three stamps  that morning I had another peach smoothie and decided to try the red velvet cupcake  The smoothie was just as ood as the first but this cupcake was VERY tasty - much better than the vanilla funfetti  I stopped again this morning and ordered a vanilla latte  That sucker far surpassed the vanilla lattes I usually get at StarbucksI love supporting local businesses and I'm only too happy to return to Copper Star time and again  I suggest you do too.
1876,"This place deserves a visit  You love Mexican  I love Mexican  but face it we've both been lazy haven't we  we go to the 'berto's places we have our favorite Tex-Mex neighborhood joints  and maybe we got a wild hair and went to La Parilla Suiza for a different style of Mexican food  but we haven't pushed the envelope and it's time we did  so get yourself over to Sunnyslope and try Los Reyes de la Torta  First of all brace yourself you will not get chips and salsa  and when you look at the menu you won't see your fave burritos or tacos offered  get over it  your mouth is about to be the happiest part of your body  they offer a wide variety of ""tortas"" (sandwiches to you gringo) and like any good sandwich place you order them with ""The Works""  At Los Reyes that means a whole pile of ingredients and they're all suicculent  Agua Fresca  Just say yes and name a fruit within moments a giant margarita style glass will be placed in front of you containing a smoothie based on aforementioned fruit plus a giant garnish of same  I ordered the Mango version and cannot remember ever sipping  a more satisfying delicious concoction which went perfectly with my torta choice the Del Rey torta large enough to pose a serious challenge to Adam Richman on Man vs Food  In my case Food won but the torta containing pork ham beef eggs guacamole onions tomatoes cheese chorizo and yes even a hot dog was a glutton's wet dream  I suggest you come with a group of at least 6 people so you can order a bunch of different things and share them aroundTry this place."
1594,First time to Pita Jungle we loved it it was late and it was packed But where there is great food you should always find a crowd The portions were enormous even the appetizers which makes it great to share with a small groupthe atmosphere was a lot cooler than i expected being from out of town The artwork on the walls really caught my eye and gave me a lot to look at-which made the time fly while waiting on our order which was perfect timing didn't take long at all The pricing was great and the selections on the menu made it so hard to decide what to get but everyone one was extremely satisfied with their meals Wait staff was quick and friendly Wish we had one of these at home - definitely leaves you full and not guilty since you are eating pretty healthy here.
3808,Don't DO IT They ARE HORRIBLE Stay Away LOOKS are deceiving.
2694,Best Mexican food in old town for sure Loves this place and the authenticity Felt like I was on vacation.
486,"Went for a weekday lunch with the boyfriend because this place was so highly recommended by Matt S (who is  currently""The Duke"" here on Yelp's new check-in app) We barely found this place because it's tucked into the corner of a strip mall right next to a pet groomer and a preschool/daycare Once we walked in we noticed that they have a covered patio as well as indoor dining The tables are covered in butchers block paper (and they gave markers to the tables with kids although none for me Hmmmm I am a kid at heart Note: I shall ask for markers next time) I ordered the Deli Sub (ham salami and peperoni adorned with veggies oils and mayo) "
3337,I hate giving bad reviews Actually this is the lowest review I've ever given I'm not sure what else to do when I pay $23 for a pizza that arrives cold and so soggy it's completely inedible Straight to the garbage and off to buy dinner for the second time tonight Awesome.
3795,I had been wanting to go to this restaurant since I moved to AZ I love the FOX restaurants so my boyfriend made reservations for valentine's day I had my hopes up but I wasn't really impressed  We were squeezed into a corner table the service was decent and it was quite noisy  I didn't feel that I was able to experience the vibe of the restaurant being in the corner I order pasta w/breadcrumbs/mushrooms and I ended up returning it It just didn't taste right Desert menu was a disappointment as well Overall I wouldn't recommend the restaurant.
105,"Myself and a group of around 12 friends were in the midst of a downtown bar-hop in honor of my fianc√©e's 30th birthday on Saturday November 10th 2012 Many of us were wearing 18th century french aristocrat costumes and were jovial extremely high spirited and looking forward to going into an event being held at this bar Upon arrival the patio-onlookers immediately began to try to get photos with us the people at the door and even security were cracking up and excited for us to be a part of their evening This particular event had a relatively high cover price for some of our party-goers and being that we were going to make up for any type of cover in many birthday drinks (we had spent an average of over $100 at each bar we went to this night) we felt it appropriate to simply ask if waiving the cover for out party would be alright Here is where the first mistake was made - the door people claimed this ""had to be brought to the attention of the manager"" As a promoter myself if a group of this many people come to your event together (especially those with particularly colorful personalities) you simply encourage their patronage in any way possible 12 people have a lot of friends collectivelyas a bar you don't want to offend them On top of this we knew the party promoters personally and many of the people involved in this particular event and we had made this clear in the very beginningNow for the reason for the dreaded one-star reviewthe managerThe manager was visibly irritated that he had been summoned His first words to us: ""Why should I let you into my bar for free"" At this point he had been made aware that this was a birthday entourage but aside from that his comment was loud and intentionally insulting We are not rude people and were in the midst of an extraordinary night out so our response was not rude at all We simply said ""Well there are 12 of us we're going to be buying many many birthday shots and drinks and we know many of the people hosting this event Plus we look great We're in costume and even your door personnel security and people on the patio are clamoring for us to come in"" His response: ""I can't just let you in for free what is it that you even do"" It was obvious at this point that this man was rigid humorless rude and beyond salvaging our acceptance of just paying the cover and going in (which was never even ruled out) So we started just laughing at how offensive this man was being to us while he attempted to suggest we take our party elsewhere He even went to the lengths of following us out and down the stairs of the public walkway as if to insinuate that we had acted inappropriately and were being escortedGypsy bar - if you read this I hope it registers that someone felt treated so badly by your staff that they were compelled to take the time to write out a review on this site I hope it also registers that your bar earned ONE out of FIVE stars on this site without the person writing it even having to set foot in the door I would highly recommend this establishment to those who enjoy being insulted repeatedly and treated like a third-rate citizen For those looking for friendly staff and a welcoming vibe downtown Phoenix has a lot of options."
3706,"My wife did not enjoy the manicure or the ""spa pedicure"" They bring over a porcelain/ceramic bowl to soak your feet in This doesn't seem very sanitary However the workers had plenty to say about the ""Asian"" shops being unclean My wife has never gotten a fungal or other type of infection from her regular place an ""Asian"" shop The manicure was awful too The polish looked terrible and lasted barely a week She definitely won't be returning."
2239,No more traditional movie going or me This place is really cool If you have limited date time (like you are paying a babysitter) have dinner and a movie all at onceI had the coconut chicken strips and fries and they were good Don't order the cheese and cracker plate it's gross but DO order the popcornOh and being able to press a button and have someone bring you alcohol during a movie Hello.
2790,Okay so I'll start off by saying I USED to love this place  When I was with-child their sandwiches and hash browns woke me up at night   On the corner of 5th and Scottsdale the joint was uber cool (with extra umlaut for extra coolness)   The vibe was hip and friendly   This used to be a 5 star joint  WHAT HAPPENED  We knew they were moving to Craftsman Court  We were expecting something great  But it was just the opposite  Ah man what a significant disaster   Biggest disappointment so far this yearThe outside windows were dark It was hard to tell if the place was even open   We entered to an awkward and misplaced drum kit   There was no clear indication of what to do  Is this counter service  It's hard to tell  We ended up ordering at what appeared to be a bar  Or a counter  Or something elseHalf of the space is decorated with Philly jazz posters dark wood a high brow style bar and a coffee machine   The other half had a general hippie feel  The space was split by a red billiards table smack in the middle  I tell you this place has a real personality disorder   AND the place was FILTHY I almost immediately regretted stepping foot in the space  It was dirty  Was that construction dust all over the floors and tables  Should we be eating here   Reluctantly I ordered the 1/2 sandwich lunch special   After a good 25 minutes I  inquired about getting our food to-go and was promptly responded to with a good dose of stink-eye from DJ slash cashier  What a messWith the new store Philadelphia Sandwich Co missed some of the key concepts critical to staying alive in the restaurant biz  including basic layout and flow  The lunch crowd was nonexistent on a Wednesday afternoon with only 3 other diners   One gentleman came in and promptly turned around to leave  I have to say I'm a bit concerned with their product turnover with that little traffic at a normally busy time the food can't stay fresh for long   The vibe up all night like a dirty pancake and not in a good way   The space filthy and not in a sexy way  The food now tainted   I hope the after 2am crowd can turn a blind eye and save this joint  I know my out-all-night noshes would rather be at the Awful House than here.
3673,This place is always hit or miss but every time I order hummus the server thumbs up the pitas His big dirty thumb right on top of all the pita breads You see the guy coming in and out of the front door a hundred times an hour thats ben touched by every person in the restaurant Just seems like a good way to cross contaminate the food during flu season Is it me or does the salad always have slimy greens and crappy tomatoes Suggestion tell your servers to keep their dirty paws out of my food.
81,Captain Ted is awesome He is so helpful and efficient Our Boy Scout Troop has rented kayaks from him for several years and he always gives us great service He is friendly helpful and his equipment is great quality A pleasure to do business with him.
42,Oh this place was far from where I was at  The problem with Phoenix is that every place seems like it's located in a strip mall and there are tons of them around here  Well this one was way out in Pima off of Shea but it was worth the trip  They have delicious coffee here  I ordered a caramel cappuccino with non-fat milk and it was very tasty  I saw that they also have a dark roast Colombian coffee and bought half a pound of it  They ground it up for me and it smells so nice and rich  When I think of commercials where the scent of coffee is around and wakes you up I'd want it to smell like this coffee  It's a pretty decent sized coffee shop filled with glass artwork and other little Latin trinkets that they sell  I like the cultural mix and feel of the place  I believe that they host several types of social cultural gatherings  I have seen the website advertise salsa dancing amongst other events  I may have to have my friend bring some of this coffee back if I become addicted  I had to open my carry-on in the plane to get to my neck pillow and my ground coffee was in there and the 2 passengers next to me commented on how good the coffee smelled.
1126,I have to say i really love this place I live just a few blocks away and it is very nice to have a cleannice place so close by I have gone there many times now and have never had a bad experience They send out some fantastic coupons  Only one time did i go through the drive thrui usually always get out of the car and go in  The store is always very clean which you can not say at the Mac Donald's 2 doors down They always acknowledge you when you come in but not in an annoying way  Very friendly and fast service They can answer questions about their products and I really like the coffee I just drink the plain black coffee nothing in it So i can say the flavor is really good A lot of places in this neighborhood do not make it It is a little rough over here  So i am very glad that they are here  Oh another plus they do not put the napkins on lock down You can help yourself.
3269,Sassy glasses do have an amazing selection of glasses  That is all they have going for themOn two occasions I have gone into this store shopping for glasses the first time I went in I did find a frame I fell in love with however the sales girl was standoffish and rude to my son  I did not purchase the frames that day but was going to go back and get themOn my second visit to the store I was so put off by all of the sales staff the treated me and my sister like we were only in the store so that we could steal from them  I did not purchase the glasses for this reason and will not be going back.
4783,I had to remove my other review because first impressions can be wrongAWEFUL Went with my parents and the rude young girl taking the order messed every burger up Went up to complain and nobody would listen they kept their heads down and never made eye contact with meSo I came home and wrote a letter I gave them a week to get back to me and still no reply Don't go if you want your order screwed up and you actually want to enjoy your dinnerWe won't be going back to the Habit ever again.
1261,This is our go to delivery pizza They always say it will take 45 minutes but they are here in 30 and sometimes under We live very close but other places haven't delivered as fast as these guysWe usually end up ordering on Sundays when we are to lazy to cook and we always order the same thing They are nothing but consistent and good from the pizza to the wings I have had other pizza around the valley but none this goodjust genuinely good pizza and service (and ranch dressing).
4195,Service is the word or lack of it  WOW.
186,I have purchased many sets of tires over the years from Discount Tire Three sets total from this location I searched for prices on-line and called all the local tire sellers to find the best price I found a couple on-line companies that I could get them cheaper for but mostly just the difference in tax I opted (again) to use a local retailer for tires They are local and I do not have to transport tires to the shopand the tires I wanted were on sale Once I decided where to buy my tires I was able to check online for store stock I called the store and spoke to Ryan who informed me those tires were on sale Being strapped for time I asked what times were available for an appointment He said he could put me in the queue now and I would be up in about 15 I arrived in 10 paid for the tires and they had it in the bay before I put my credit card back in my wallet 30 min later and I was off with 4 new tires I will be back.
3862,"Boiled down: I found something I wanted on their site but went to the store to look at it in person and to browse aroundWhen I got there I noticed that the price online was lower than in-store -- and confirmed it via my phoneI asked the cashier nicely and they refused to price-match (two whole bucks) So I asked to see the ""manager"" who was mind-blowingly rude and unhelpful No apology offered - totally the opposite - and she essentially said they won't price match the web and they have lower prices on their site because they gouge you with shipping and ""handling"" fees etc (Super bitchy about it all) So I left and spent my money elsewhereAfter about a month (cooling-off period) I finally wrote Cost Plus' home office about that horrible manager person plus to suggest that they say something on their site (like Home Depot etc do) informing customers that in-store prices may not be the same yadda Never heard anything back from them at all Conclusion: They could not care less (Also know that this is a store I have been going to since I was a little kid -- they're from the Bay Area) Therefore I'll never set foot in Cost Plus again and hope to enlighten others about their crappy business practices :P It's not about the two dollars -- it's about the total disrespect for their customersEspecially in this economy good service is SO important (As is fair pricing)."
3375,Said an hour for delivery called after an hour and ten minutes and they told me the driver had left a few minutes before I called  Total time an hour and forty and when we got the pizza the driver had driven so crazy all the toppings slid to one side.
4196,We have been regular customers here for several years and have always gotten the steampot for 2  The last time we were here we noticed that the food content had been cut in halfbut the price has remained the same  We won't be coming back.
852,PAM is a terrific museum and it just keeps getting betterCheck out the Sassoon Ivories.
1898,Maybe it's my fault for not doing my research before choosing a place to spend New Year's but my experience last night has guaranteed that American Junkie will not get any more of my business Like almost everyone else who showed up early I assumed their flyer advertising free cover before 11 and a free champagne toast at midnight was legitimate What I found instead was that the management lied (they even admitted it to our faces) and guys were now $20 to get in (girls would be $10 after 10)Half our group (mainly the girls) had already gone inside when we discovered that the guys we were with had to go hunt down ATMs coming back to a line that was poorly-managed and about 2 hours long Am I stupid for planning around a NYE flyer Maybe I'm new to Scottsdale and apparently not savvy enough to realize that some clubs in Old Town will just flat out lie to their patrons They know they'll get hordes of rude douchebags knocking down their doors to come inside anyway WHY Why was I even there and why did I give them my business Never againOh and the inside was packed like sardines They let in so many people that fights were breaking out left and right getting a drink was hopeless and bathroom lines were a half hour long People were hopping the fence to get in sick and tired of the line outside But those in our party who had to wait so long to get in were disappointed anywayWe stayed till midnight thinking JUST MAYBE the bar would keep one promise they'd advertised all over their website and pass out flutes of champagne NopeThis would have never happened in Downtown Phoenix I know it's just a bar but honestly people we need to hold places accountable for deception My friends and I planned a night out that got ruined and half our party left fed up with the situationDon't go to American Junkie it is just that junk.
2461,Hands down one of my favorite stores I didn't know there was one here in Phoenix This place has the same ambiance of Abercrombie and Fitch I'm not sure if they are tied into each other but it was a liilte weird The place was kept very clean and the employees were extremely nice and greeted us as we walked into the store I love that now I won't have to order my jeans online and I can actually try them on before I buy.
3852,I thought I drove into another countrya third world countrya sketchy third world country when I pulled off the 10 real quick  I won't let my wife go here alone day or night.
3506,I have used this repair service for several years and have found an extreme decline in service The 2 most recent times I used them they raised the prices without telling me in advance of the service Both of of these times services that were performed rather than taking the promised one week took instead close to three months with me returning over and over on new projected completion dates to incompleted work Worst of all brand new never worn pair of expensive shoes that were brought in only for stretching were damaged They were returned to me with huge gouges on the patent leather high heelsNeedless to say I have found a new shoe repair.
2502,You know what  I love Dillard's  I love this chain  I used to work for them when I first moved to Arizona actually and while I quit it almost immediately (let's face it some people just hate retail work) I've always liked their selection  Their pricing can be fair and it's just a step between Sears/JC Penney and Neiman Marcus  It's a good middle placeBut the Dillard's in Scottsdale Fashion Square is the PITS  I went here the other day on my lunch break  I was actually thinking of shelling out some serious cash just to get a pair of jeans that would last awhile and look good  I walked by not one not two not even three but SIX employees who did NOT offer to help me in any way  One even looked at me with her eyebrow raised like she thought I was going to steal something  Was it because I was in no makeup and glasses  Would I have had better customer service if I'd come in wearing my contacts makeup and a skirt  Seriously peopleI assume it's the same as when I worked there several years back--that pay is dependent on both the hourly wage and also the sales rung up  Are you honestly going to tell me that SIX employees had no interest in a woman carrying around a pair of $100 jeansI just shrugged and got a pair of Levi's instead.
3370,My husband has a beef with this restaurant I suggested we go but he reminded me that the last time 2 times we were there the food was not very good a warm iceberg lettuce salad cool pizza And he swears the server took some of our left over pizza instead of boxing it.
2835,It's date night and you're headed to the moviesNow the dilemmaEat a small mountain of hot faux-buttered popcorn at the movies or a little popcorn and a  decent meal afterwardI go with bothOnly I'm usually too full to eat anything of decent substance after all that popcorn so I typically come hereTea Lite CafeIt's cheap and filling and its under ten bucksI've tried both the chicken based pho and the beef go with the beefit has a ton more flavorAnother bonus is how the meat in the soup is all very recognizable putting that whole dog and cat meat thing to restA large bowl will feed twoI weasel most of the meat out of it when my date goes to the bathroom And she wonders why I fart so much.
2762,Props to Applebee's on 27th and Bell I went there for the free Veteran's meal It was packed but they got me in at the bar right away and had my meal in front of me within 10 minutes The whole time Courtney and Kara did an awesome job taking care of us all at the bar Really great customer service.
3554,The food was okay The service was horrible We felt very rushed because the waitress kept coming back to take our plates and the last time was before one of us had finished our food It was 9:35 and the waitress came to collect our money for the bill without even asking nicely She said they needed to close out the till How rude Won't be going back.
2985,"All I have to say is afternoon High tea Baby OK-So who can really afford to go to the Phoenician I mean even on a ""staycation""-the place is hella spendy BUT-if you are looking for an elegant time at a decent rate try their afternoon high tea It is honestly the best I have had with the exception of Tea in London at the Dorchester And much less expensive than the Dorchester which ranks the Phoenician High on my list What an experience first off you can chose from a regular tea or tea with unlimited Champagne Both happen to be very reasonably priced The area they serve the tea in is incredibly elegant and outright gorgeous big fluffy velvet couches some high backed upholstered chairs silver place setting and English bone china  They also have a pianist playing calming music that is just loud enough to remind you that he's there The food and fair is plentiful the tea is divine and the champagne flowed Best of all the staff is comforting and they allow you to take your time and enjoy the ritual of the experience I highly recommend this place A+."
4914,This was my third visit and my last Each time I come I try something else- thinking my last poor experience was just a fluke It's not this place just stinks This time the food was average at BEST  Though it was hot it took awhile to get out and looked like it had just been thrown on the plate The worst was the service Never have I ever tipped under 10% or had such a poor customer service experience The waitress came to take our order and then disappeared (busers brought out our food and then too disappeared) We literally had to waive her down to ask for our check and even then she never showed up again Ten minutes later we had to waive down the manager to get our check No water refills no checking on our order (when we needed items) nothing Lunch was miserable overpriced and long DO NOT BOTHER.
68,This place has the most amazing Gelato I have been there plenty of times and I always make sure that anytime I have friends or family visiting that we make a trip They have plenty of flavors to choose from I was there this past Monday with my sister We met an employee named Nelson who was also a fellow New Yorker After talking to him and experiencing his amazing customer service I can honestly say that this is the type of employee every boss wishes for Nelson was super friendly and made us feel so comfortable and welcome there I love leaving an establishment with that feeling I plan on visiting more often now Thanks Nelson.
1656,Excellent location of Fry's  Conveniently located just a mile south of the Loop 101 on Alma School Rd in Chandler AZ  Employees are always friendly & ready to help when needed  Store is always stocked up and items are easy to find  They just upgraded their self service check-outs to new computers  Very convenient and easy to use  Usually quick to get in shop and get out =).
1619,"I used to frequent another locally owned Tempe coffee shop to get my work done during the day and to visit with friends in the evenings but between good coffee drinks and a perfect laid back atmosphere OSP has definitely won me over They don't pressure you to buy something the owners simply welcome you in and are excited to share their vision for OSP to be a fun collaborative workspace They're passionate about what they're doing and it really shows  but even though they don't have a ""one drink minimum"" to use their internet or to hang out there you should get a drink anyhow Seriously My favorite is definitely the soy iced chai - super smooth and great flavor though I guess that could be said about their espresso as well :) The location was a little tough for me to find at first - it's in a plaza tucked away on the south side on University between McClintock and Dorsey but it should be much easier to find once they get a real sign out front."
4821,You know I have been here before and the sushi was good BUT EVERYTIME I ORDER TAKEOUT MY FOOD IS RIDICULOUSLY HORRIBLEThe first time I ordered takeout it was okay Nothing to go nuts about The second time my California roll literally tasted like soap and it was warm Yuck I decided to give them the benefit of the doubt and order once more (only because Stingray sucks and RA has terrible service)okay my rice was soo sticky on the rolls that I choked on itlike they put superglue on my rice and it didn't finish drying and my spicy tuna was literally dark brown Totally unacceptableC'mon PearlI thought you were better than that.
4776,My experience with Molina Bridal was about three years ago  I didn't do yelp then or you better believe I would have put this comment then  I'm looking for dresses again and saw Molina on here so thought I should warn those considering this placeAt first our experience was great  Heck it was amazing  We had gone to other places and looked at dresses for my nieces quinceanera and they just couldn't do what we wanted  Then we went to Molina  The staff was so nice and helpful and painted a beautiful picture  We selected dresses for the girls - 14 of them from one of the books they had  They we simple black dresses but we wanted to add some pink to it so decided on a pink strap that would be sewn in around the waist about two inches thick  When the dresses came in we all went for a fitting only one of the dresses had the strap and it was only pinned on so we could see  We were fine with that and actually glad because the strap was not even  Where the strap was to meet in the back on either side of the zipper you could clearly see that the strap wasn't evenly cut  One side was about 1/4 in thinner  They assured us this was just a fast cut done so we could see the look but that everything would be done perfect  A couple weeks before the quinceanera the dresses weren't done yet  The girls weren't able to pick them up until the week of  The girls started picking up the dresses on Wednesday for a Saturday event  On Friday we had our final rehearsal and I had all the girls bring there dresses so they could try them on and we could see how they looked in them  We were so excited to see them in there dresses  Then that excitement turned to horror when the girls started coming out in there dresses  The satin straps that they had sewn on were horrible  On some you could see the yarn that's how poorly and loose the strap was sewn in  The majority of the others were like the strap was at the fitting  Where the strap meet in the back I had two dresses extremely off  One side was the 2 inches it should have been and the other closer to 1 inch  No way did the seamstress not notice how off that was they just didn't careI immediately called them and they were extremely rude and laughed yes they even laughed  I told them I would be there in the morning and that someone better fix at minimum the two dresses that were so horribly off  They flat out told me know and that they would call the police if I went  Now I was mad when I called them because they were extremely rude but to refuse to fix the dresses and threaten to call the police  That is crazy  The morning of the quince I drove with the two girls and their dresses to Molina's and when they saw me pull up they locked the doors  They just looked at me and smirked  That didn't go to well for them as a few other cars pulled at the same time as me all potentially new customers so I proceeded to tell them my story and show them the dresses One of the girls at Molina's came out and told the others they could enter they all got back into their cars and left  I ended up taking the dresses to Ofelias Bridal all the way across town  I remind you this is the day of the event  I went spoke to Ofelia directly and she was amazing  I had dealt with her 10 years prior for my own quince and kicked my self for not going to her in the first place  Ofelia took the dresses and told me to come back in an hour  We left and got our makeup done and came back for the dresses  They were perfect  She even fixed a few other mistakes on the dresses that I hadn't even asked but she noticed when she had the girls try the dresses on when we first went  We made it back home to finish getting ready and in the end those two dresses were the best ones  I'm sure not all experiences will be like ours but I definitely wouldn't chance it ever again.
7,Great food and atmosphere  Plenty of TVs to watch the games  Chef Patrick Fegan and his partners of TK Urban Tavern in Scottsdale Quarter just opened this great location  Pumpkin Soup with pumpkin oil and croutons is such a great start to the Fall season  Wood fired oven pumping out flatbreads  Sweet Potato gnocchi made in house with roasted corn and gorgonzola crema is unbelievable  Very impressive selection of beer handles and delicious cocktails   Amazing view of the sunset as well  Can't wait to return.
2542,OHSO doesn't stand for anything in particular but who cares This place has a nice feel friendly service and a terrific brunch The food was uber-tasty but what really wowed us was the $10 price for a brunch item plus a 10 ounce beer Where else can you be fed like that Good menu choices like breakfast burritos green pork chile and a fantastic french toast with toppings Love the open garage door windows and the cool mist on the toasty Arizona patio.
4854,"Since we knew Baseball Spring Training was a busy time we made a 3/23/11 reservation at this restaurant on March 6 2011 via phone (they don't use Open Table) at 3:00 pm (I have phone records to prove it)  We asked for an inside table at 7:00 pm and were assured it was reserved  However when we arrived for our reservation last night it was not to be found - and the hostess blew us off as though we were trying to scam our way in  Since they don't use Open Table or email I have no written proof but didn't think as a ""customer"" it was up to us to re-confirm the reservation  Although we have enjoyed this restaurant in the past their recent notice in SF Chron seems to have gone to their head  They need to improve their reservation system so this doesn't happen to others who have the foresight to make advance reservationsJeanSan Francisco."
640,Love  Love Love this place.
1578,Best Place to watch UFC for free Best place to watch regular season games due to the many Tv's if its on TV they got it Best place for 2 and 3 dollar beers Appetizers are always half off You can even request games on the Tv' near you Ive been coming here for 4 years and love itAnyone that doesn't like this place is a moron or a snob plain and simple.
3946,Pubic hair in the bed poop on the wall in the bathroom smelt like a porta potty Other than that it was a grade A classy placeNOT Save yourself never go here.
3346,"I didn't get a chance to try the food here but Yelp won't let me post a review without any stars so I choose one because I looked forward to trying this restaurant but when I got there I couldn't go inside because they have a ""no firearms"" sign posted prominently  Since both of us in our party take our own personal safety seriously by carrying concealed firearms we went somewhere else to eat Good way to turn away customers but at least we discovered Pita Jungle the food there was great and no silly ""No Firearms"" signs to turn away law abiding customers Seriously do you think a person intent on robbery or mayhem would heed those signs."
3490,"I enjoyed this place in the 90's But I really don't see why it still exists Does anyone buy CD's anymore I can get any DVD/BluRay I want on Ebay If I wanted tacky trinkets I could go to some place like Spencer's in the mall or Red Hot Robot if I fancied myself ""cool"" Perhaps its time Zia faded away like the VCR or countless other  pieces of 20th century technology."
2714,OMG As an unofficial wing connoisseur BWW was the front runner - not any more people  I ordered via their app for take out - yes their app which is SUPER convenient and my order was waiting for me when I got there  Their wings are Atkins friendly and most of their sauces too  Thier wing prices are also less than BWW  Mmm Hmm So we ordered the 30 wing count with 3 different sauces 2 orders of celery only and 2 orders of blue cheese  The sauces were really good - the cajun - buttery spicey goodness  Totally cravable  Their blue cheese dipping sauce REAL blue cheese and NOT runny watery grossness  Ya know sometimes it's the little things that make me HAPPY  They have many sizes of wings especially if you want to get some for a party  They are also known for their yeast rolls which I've had pre-atkins and those are heavenly  Wingstop is our new go to for wing cravings.
3848,WowSorry Charlie's I have to give you a star even though you don't deserve anySeems as though you cannot bring a bag in larger than an average bank deposit bag Your rude doorman made that perfectly clear Strange you're right on the light rail Locals will be carrying messenger bags backpacks purses as they use this form of transportation No worries though There are plenty of other welcoming bars along or close to the light rail lineYee Haw.
2647,Amazing as always The classic philly cheessteak will never let you down Fast service great food.
3897,This place is death on a plate The buffet served like warm food The hibachi raw meats were warm and slimy The manager just shrugged his shoulders and said ah well I then puked in the parking lot NASTIEST PLACE EVER.
4470,Do not go here unless you don't really care if your nails look nice Very inconsistent rushed jobs Every single time I've gone I've had some reason to not go back Today I went again and again inconsistently bad overall services from everyone in that place Find somewhere else to go so you won't leave there every time disappointed and irritatedlike I do.
4484,"If you want your order to be correct call another franchise They do not listen forget to include the additional items in the delivery but NEVER forget to charge you for them We ordered 2 Pizzones only one came then the ""manager"" (I'll use the term loosely) gave us attitude when we called back to complain She had the Pizzone redelivered AN HOUR LATER without so much as an apology I hate hate hate this Pizza Hut."
765,This place is phenomenal I highly recommend the cajun red snapper seasoned veggies  and red beans and rice The waiter was incredibly polite and created a delightful dining experience.
4052,Not my favorite place in the world I love in and out they by far have the best burgers Lennies burgers is alright but if you really want a real good burger you go to burger bar in Vegas.
2916,"I work at the Zoyo next door to Vovomeena - Today was my first time ordering from them I truly had a wonderful breakfast I ordered the Wilcox Avenue which is a traditional breakfast - i wanted to play it safe lol And it was amazing as i was waiting for my food i saw a few other dishes that looked amazing The menu is small yet the options have so many items it seems bigger The best part is the coffee bar which is all ""locally crafted"" as it states on their menu They can make u just about anything Ben the Barista was a super sweet guy and gave great service The decor is beautiful Check it out u will not be disappointed."
4848,"At first look this is a great company We recently purchased a house from smokers so we had to have the ENTIRE interior of a 2700 sq ft house repainted (closets ceilings EVERYTHING) David came out to give a quote and was very nice and professional Explained everything to us Stated they were going to roll the walls instead of spray so that in the future if we have to touch them up you can't see the brushstrokes We had never considered this and were impressed that the information was offered and explained as we had assumed spraying which would be MUCH faster and easier of a project of this size Day 1: the 2 painters clogged and flooded the hall bathroom toilet so there was sewer water UNDER the plastic taped to protect the floor from paint No apologies from either of them Fast forward a week when the painting is done Walls were painted incorrect colors the rope lighting on a ledge near the ceiling was not put back light fixtures were still taped over tape was still on the edge of carpet and ceilings and windows When we called the head painter Richard he came back corrected the paint colors and rope lighting without grumble but was supposed to remove all the tape and uncover fixtures but didn't We STILL were unable to get in touch with David They also sprayed the walls and when contacted we David he never got back to us and even Richard said he couldn't get a hold of him Not only did they spray but when we went to get the leftover paint cans to touch up some dings from moving in and installing granite they were full of WATER that they used to clean out the sprayer So in essence we have NO extra paint in ANY of the 4 colors we used They were also supposed to paint the ceiling in a flat paint so that there would be no glare and visible spray linesguess what Its NOT flat paint and glares and spray lines are VERY visibleThere are many paint smudges on windows that we had to clean off and were hanging a clock the other day and saw a dirty hand print from one of them where they must have braced themselves on the wall when climbing a ladder  2 weeks later we are still trying to get in touch with them and just opened another can of supposedly ""extra"" paint and found it full of trash NASTY I would NEVER recommend them to ANYONE and we should have gone with another company Saving $500 has NOT been worth the headache to not even get a call back from David Richard the head painter did always followed up with us and respond to calls but the details of trash disposal and tape removal were seriously lacking."
3936,I made an appointment for my daughter to see Dr Glick we were both very excited about the appointment especially since Dr Glick claimed to be a DO We thought he would take a more natural approach to my daughter's acne All he did was tell her she would most likely need acutane in the future (and we all know how safe that is) and tell her (without being asked his opinion on this matter) that her post acne hyperpigmentation would take years to heal What a terrible thing to tell a 14 year old girl just entering high school He had terrible bedside manner and his office manager is incredibly rude STAY AWAY.
182,It's unfortunate that I have to write a bad review- but I believe it's important to get this out there This is especially for those that are non-locals Thursday night my friend and I needed a ride back to our hotel It was already late and we could not take the light rail back because it had already made its last roundStrike 1: Driver did not know where he was going & he was on his cell phone asking for directionsStrike 2: I knew that he knew a more direct way to get to our hotel instead he chose to take a scenic route through a residential area Therefore making the drive longer than it should have been Strike 3: THE METER WAS NOT RUNNING So he basically just said a random price when we got to our hotelWe were picked up in the US AIRWAYS CENTER and our hotel was on Central & Osborn We paid $12 for the fare I guess I should assume that is a decent price However the service was unacceptable from my perspective The meter should have been onPS they also DBA as Elite Taxi Cab.
1460,"I had dinner last night for the first time at this place and I have to say that I really really liked it a lot  Upon entering the location I was impressed with how it was set up  Clean nice with lots of outdoor seating  The decor gave me a ""fancy"" feeling of dining yet without the menu sticker shock  Clean nice marble looking tables some booths and  a big beautiful mirror hung from one of the walls  Well decoratedAfter sitting down to eat with Gabi We were waited on almost immediately and the server was attentive and gave us time to think about our orders  The menu has a wide variety of items to choose from and from what I could tell ALL the prices were relatively cheapI ended up eating the Gyro pita and I must say it was tasty and the portion was quite ample and large  I would put this on my list of places to return for the good eats since I was so happy the first time around  I feel that you can't go wrong at this place from my experience  I would feel comfortable bringing my parents and dates here as I was impressed with the overall feel of the resturant along with the excellent food good sized portions wide menu variety and cheap prices."
3604,EEEW NO THIS PLACE IS SUPER MEGA TACKY WAY GHETTO When My son was younger (6) he asked me to take him there I did And OMG we both hated it And we tried it a second time when my girlfriend had a bday party for her son and It was just horrible The people that go there are all shady looking I'd say a dangerous crown This place is NO FUN And It's a scary crowd yukky.
3528,"Are YOU kidding me This very morning I walked over to this ""hidden treasure"" as I had found it a few weeks ago  I saw the fantastic baked goods and couldn't wait to share with my friends I wouldn't spend a nickel hereRude Rude Rude10:20 this morning I was treating myself to breakfast and the little girl behind the counter was sweet  I spotted the menu and decided to use the table service the girl was bringing me a menu and a muffin as I'm sitting the owners whipped husband comes to the table and tells me he needs the table for the lunch crowd  I said and lunch is when  He says well you have a computer and you may stay for hours and I need this table so I proceed to another and that was the wrong table too  He wants me at a tiny table in the doorway in the sun  I asked if he was kidding I had been in the hospitality industry and he was not acting hospitableThe little girl is trying to hand me the plate with the muffin and I'm telling her it is okay please wrap it to goI'm not wanted here The queen bitch sitting in the wing back chair with her strap on under her apron in case the husband acts up pipes up to tell me that I do not need to buy the muffin - I told her she was absolutely right and walked out."
4088,"Canvas was originally Phoenix's first strip mall and my what a legacy it has left upon the Valley  Luckily it has now turned into a First Friday destination as an art space and a small concert venueWell according to the Arizona Republic in an article dated 1/31/08:-----------------------------""While the northeast corner of Third and Roosevelt Streets has previously been an open area where local artists and musicians have performed for First Friday last December was the first time in recent years organized entertainment has taken place at the venue Construction on the land which covers 90000 square feet began in October Within six months CANVAS will become a nightclub a 24-hour newsstand a grocery an art gallery and home to three restaurants and a miniature skate park""-----------------------------Seriously  This is one of the most visible spots in downtown and just about the most prime spot for a min-entertainment district  THIS kind of grass-roots activity is why Roosevelt Row will absolutely demolish the completely manufactured 'Jackson Street Entertainment District' proposed for later this decadeSo by June-ish there will be:~ A bar/nightclub~ 3 restaurants (I hear that one of them will be a sushi place)~ A 24 hour newsstand (unheard of for DT that something will be open 24 hrs)~ A grocery (another much-needed commodity)~ A mini skatepark (bringing the 'urban' element to RR)They already hold concerts here and withing the next few months they will hold one with 15 bands  I can't wait to review this place once its fully developed  In the meantime I'm giving it 5 stars for the proposal."
2791,"I used to go to Jalapenos many years ago before they had a fire  My friend and I checked it out tonight and were pleasantly surprised  The layout is completely different the menu is much more extensive and expensive ( OK though)  Our waitress JJ was right on the ball with drinks and our food order  I had the shrimp tacos and they were quite good  My friend had the seafood enchilada and said it was very good also  We have one complaint though and it's a big one for us  This was something we didn't notice until after we ordered and the food arrived  The people behind us had a dog in the restaurant and it wasn't a service dog  The dog was medium sized and in some kind of nylon carrier with screened sides and an open unzipped top  When we mentioned to our waitress that it's against the law she said ""Oh it's OK it's in a carrier""  That did it for us we will never go back there again Instead of 3 or 4 stars we give it a one because of the dog."
3963,what is this filth that i am eatinghad it delivered  but whoops  forgot the rice  how do you forget the riceanyhow the peanut sauce was deplorable  it was literally the consistency of water i could pour it down the drain - and didthe panang curry was the same -- more like soup and less like sauce  this place is easily in the bottom 3 of thai places i have ever eaten at.
3838,Sure their branding is nice It has that feel of something hip and youthful which helps for a chain that tries to pass itself off as a local Pretty colors and shiny things however don't impress my palateI can't explain how much I detest food from Zoe's Fresh vegetables grilled meats -- it should be a slam dunk Instead their food is BLAND It is the inverse of food it is anti-food annihilating the satisfaction of eating with every bite.

844,This is a great shop  Stopped in a few nights ago just as they were closing  I was trying to hurry and look at everything so I staff could get out of there on time  But they were super cool and said they still had lots to do and take our time  I bought a really cute necklace - its a tiny wishbone on a very thin thread that you are to wear until it falls off and then your wish will come true - how cute is that  Wonderful wine racks too  I love this place.
1585,"Been driving by this place for a few years on our way to/from Lost Dutchman State Park and always noticed LOTS of cars  pickup tooout front  We took a chance that night and what a surprise  Great place  Good ole cowboy bar/restaurant w/dance floor and band  We had the chicken and it was the best I've ever had  We paid extra to get another breast but it turned out they were so big that I took it home  My husand ordered the shrimp & chicken and they gave him an order of chicken & ribs by mistake  They promptly replaced it  butwe made a big mistake  We are not ""rib people"" but they looked super good and he was sorry he didn't keep the ""mistake""  Served with potato wedges cole slaw & buiscuit   Shrimp was so/so   Really good plus the wait staff is very friendly and fast service  We will definitely go theyre next visit."
651,Not so good Not clean Try Siam thai Much better and clean.
2342,I have been here twice so far both ventures for the afternoon buffet The second trip came recently to confirm the quality as I remember being blown away the first time and had another great experience I am excited to start eating here more often as it is on the way to school Until like 2:30 pm they have an all you can eat buffet for around $9 and a guy like me is fully capable of devouring 3-4 entrees in order to get full So this is the basis for my review as I may or may not make it in for dinner any time soon due to my schedule I started the game picking out a little sample of everything offered and then was planning to take it from there eliminating what I didn't like as I went up for secondsI absolutely loved it all but only went back up for a few items due to being (surprisingly) full Although I enjoyed the grilled veggies I would have to put them on the side next time as they didn't mix well with the chicken curry and masala items That was my bad though as I had chosen poorly with my plate compositionI will gradually update this review as I learn more info about the dishes I plan to start going here a lot for lunch and will be more vigilant about what is what.
2491,THE premier craft beer destination in the Valley of the Sun  If you want to try a beer you've never had I guarantee you find new and different labels at Papago    Decent pub grub and fair drink prices make this place an ultra-chill beer nirvana.
3904,"DO NOT GO HERE  Even if you've suddenly developed airport standards you can do better Walk down toward gate C17 you'll find three better places right away The service here is slow the margaritas are ALL mix and the food is bland and a complete waste of your money  According to a couple other yelpers the food here has been compared to ""fast food"" I--a complete stranger whom you should trust because I'm taking the time out if my life to tell you a stranger this info--am telling you it is much worse than fast food I've experienced much more pleasure from fast food It has flavor and doesn't cost what you make per hour This place was better a couple years ago Perhaps they have new management Who cares Take your biz on down the line."
2979,"Ohh if I could only give them 0 starsI brought one of my suits in to be dry cleaned  I just usually have them pressed to take the wrinkles out but it was time to get them dry cleaned  When it picked it up the next day my suit pants had a huge tear in the leg  The lady claimed that it was like that when they were turned in  I asked her ""why would I bring in a torn up suit to be dry cleaned"" and ""why wouldn't you call when you found the tear""  The lady could not give a straight answer and her body language tone and answers given indicate that she wasn't telling the truth  I asked to speak to her manager but no one else was there."
189,Matt's (of Matt's Big Breakfast) new bar  Located in a cozy vintage home this is my new favorite bar  Handpicked beer and wine selection make this an excellent destination for downtown snobs (not rippin I tend to be one of those)  Best of all Matt has jumped on the smoking ban before it even takes effect this means you can enjoy your beer without having to breathe in all that nasty ass poison you smokers keep pumping into the air  Seriously Lesley and I went to a dinner party recently filled with smokers in a non ventilated home  Jesus God how do you people stand it  Smoking is gross The Roosevelt is cool.
1187,Split  a couple of dishes and dessert with my friend First and foremost my favorite item was the pineapple fried rice (came with Chicken Raisins Nuts Pineapple) which was made spicy the combination of the spices and the pineapple makes me want to come here again Also got a noodle dish called the pad key mew w/ tofu that was pretty good and spicy enough for my tasting but my friend recommended to get it Thai Spicy if your into that Finished up with sticky rice w/ mango and a Thai Iced Tea Get there while you can  Oh yeah and their music was killing it Tracy Chapman Shawn Colvin Men at Work some 90's shit.
215,Huge store Probably the biggest Sports Authority i've ever been too Love the selection for the women's clothing and all of the shoes The lines can be long though and the store itself is kind of hidden by trees which is a shame Employees were nice and the sale rack was a good size Dressing room area could be a little bit bigger though.
2298,"First class experience all the wayI decided to treat myself to a staycation for my birthday this year and when I was looking at rates and locations I decided to go with The Boulders I made my reservation and the personal concierge Carol was in touch a few weeks before my stay just to check if there was anything she could take care of before I arrived which I really appreciated We checked in Saturday afternoon which was quick and easy Carol recognized me as I was checking in and the experience was pleasant Our casita wasn't too far from the lounge but we used the golf carts the majority of the time we were there - the drivers were all super friendly The room - gorgeous Nice little kitchenette wonderful seating area with the worlds most comfortable leather chairs huge comfy bed and giant bathroom and closet area After getting settled in we headed off to the main pool for a little bit and had a drink while we were there Afterwards we headed off-site for dinner returned to check out Sunset Pointe and then retired to our room for the night While we were there Carol must have took notice that I was visiting for my birthday and sent over a bottle of wine and a chocolate/fruit dessert - 5 stars for Carol Before we left for breakfast we checked out the spa and the pool near the front We learned that we could have used the sauna steam room and jet spa while we were there - a note to remember for next time The pool by the spa looked to be more ""chill"" and they have an organic garden where it appears you can pick fresh herbs and veggies I had a fantastic time It's far enough from the city and the surroundings are so beautiful you forget that you're still just a few miles outside of Scottsdale The staff was great the grounds were beautiful and I'll definitely be back in the future."

519,"Just got back from lunch at Switch and I am SUPER happy I decided to go here for my birthday lunch I had the special that was going on veggie ravioli for only $795 I would definitely come back for this meal again It was delicious The flavor was so good and the meal didn't ""weigh"" me down like some ravioli dishes It was light and completely satisfyingTo my surprise my lovely boyfriend phoned in and ordered me a white sangria It was AMAZING I would for sure recommend this Try it you won't be disappointedAnother great surprise was that they brought me out a delicious chocolate chip cookie bake with a scoop of vanilla ice cream and a candle on top with a pair of Happy Birthday glasses and napkin The desert was to die for I unfortunately couldn't eat the whole thing but I did my best Thank you Switch for making my solo birthday lunch outing a very memorable experience."
4868,"Well once again the service was awful  WHY does a restaurant think that a cute young gal at the hostess station means anything if she is useless   We walked in and stood in front of the hostess stand this blonde looked at us and said nothing   I thought she didn't work thereI said "" do you know where the hostess is""  She said "" I am the hostess ""  I was floored   Was she ever trained  How the f*"
3786,HORRIBLE customer service I don't expect a lot but I think a hello and how can I help you is in order when spending over $100 on dog food The price tag was missing off the shelf and the food wasn't ringing up so the boy working decided to just come up with a random amount higher than all the other bags in that size/brand around it  I shut that idea down quickly I was the only one in the store looking around for products and not one person asked if I needed help I will go back to my better mom and pop store that sells the same high end products Its further but better than having to deal with horrible sales people.
4753,A bunch of Co workers and I went here for lunch thinking of breaking the normal lunch time routine  Well the experience was terrible to say the least  Our waitress lost our simple order and came back to us a half hour after she took our initial order to admit it  Things happen Its understandable  But another half hour goes by with  no signs of our food or even a heads up when it might be coming out Now we are late coming back from our lunch break and we just wanted to pay for our drinks and go We felt as it was forced upon us to stay and did not feel like it was right  So long story short She did not give us any discount on her mistake  they gave us to go boxes  Messed up everyone's order in the to go box  and each paid 13 dollars for a lunch that tasted so un-cooked that half of us ended up throwing it away If you do go here  Just make sure you have plenty of time to hang out.
4620,"I never leave reviews but after going to Clever Koi this weekend I just had too I will start by saying that the drinks and ambiance  were very good The vibe there is really cool The FOOD on the other hand Was terrible I wanted to like this place so badly Growing up in Hawaii I have spent most of my life eating Japanese food I have had Japanese food all over the country and in japan Out of the 7 dishes we ordered only one person liked their meal My ramen was so bad I couldn't finish itand considering that the portion was very small that says a lot I left hungry I told the waitress that I did not enjoy the meal and that most of us at the table were very disappointedshe said ""oh I'm sorry That's too bad"" And that was it I've been working in service for over 15 years I was very surprised at that response and that no one came over to ask about our experience or even to offer a drink or dessert I didn't want or expect a comp of my meal but considering the reviews and that this place is newer I would think they would have tried to turn around a table of 7s opinion If you want good drinks and ambiancego If you want great Japanese food I wouldn't recommend it."
3136,I was hoping for a great cheeseburger Unfortunately the burger was not good I prefer In and Out Burger  It was greasy tasteless and expensive Yuk.
1133,Outstanding service will always be going back for the dinner Thank you Liberty Market for our date night.
2775,I ordered a mixed drink Bartender grabs a glass fills it 3/4 of the way with ice pours in alcohol and soda just until the ice starts to float and then grabs the ice scooper and adds MORE ICE TO MY GLASSThis place blows.
802,I love FE This is my go to spot for almost all of my grocery needs I love the produce section even though its a lil on the expensive side but you can always find organic I adore the premade meals too which is so convenient for me and my fam on those nights I don't feel like cooking Plus its good to be able to read and understand the ingredients on the packaging  The wine section isn't shabby either This is the ONLY place where I will buy my Malbecand the price is nice too I can be finicky about my wine too so this hits the spot and tames the beast They also sell my staples quinoa olive oil nuts coconut water just to name a few I am so glad this location is here to stay FE is my spot and always will be.
1625,Love this place  Arley has done my hair twice now  She does a fantastic job  She takes her time and you can tell she really cares about her customers  I will definitely keep coming back  Prices are great and the salon offers you water or soda too.
822,I've been here a couple of times with the BF and I've had a great time every time They have good food and I love how when the armrest is put up it feels like were watching a gigantic tv on our couch in the living room I love that we get to cuddle up super comfortably and munch on some fries and candy I learned my lesson about drinking too much before a movie having no recollection of the movie Immortals so I have since grown to love the whole movie and (1) drink concept Love the fact there aren't children and you can reserve your seats I haven't had any instances of dis-satisfactory service or technical difficulties so I can't give them any less of a rating The ticket prices are reasonable for all that you get I definitely think it's worth the extra couple of bucks It's fairly close to where we live making it more convenient than going to Studio Movie Grill but I have yet to try UltraStar Love the french fries here Will return many times over I'm sure.
581,This is an unassuming small business that is a little out of the way and hidden in a shopping center but definitely worth visiting  I found it on yelp and tried it out on a whim when I saw the positive feedback  My family in the Philippines owns various restaurants in Manila so when I traveled there we ate - a lot  This it the first restaurant I have found in the Valley where you can get lumpia pancit chicken adobo (and various dishes that are more authentic than I tend to eat) and a yummy version of halo halo with ube ice cream  The people here are very nice the restaurant was extremely accommodating and clean   They even stayed open 2 hours later for us when we hosted a karaoke event here  We loved the boba drinks and for those who were too timid to try the Filipino dishes they have an American menu (burgers/fries/corndogs)   They have karaoke on Fridays with a great song selection - in English  Come here for casual and inexpensive eats that are authentic and tasty.
2541,This is my very mostest favorite Pei Wei  Food is THE BESTI don't know why but this particular location makes the BEST Pei Wei food  Perhaps it's the incredible volume of business that they turn everyday~ they've truly got the magic touchI am a regular there for lunch at least once a week  It is almost always crazy busy  They are efficient and friendlyThe food is always prepared well  You THINK a chopped chicken salad is the same here as at other Pei Wei's  NOT SO my friend   THIS one knows just how long to poach it debone and deskin it and the proper dice  It is always a sublime salad experienceWhatever your favorite PeiWei dish is it will be prepared better at this location  Parking here can be a bear but there is a lot across the street for overflow traffic- southeast corner of 7th Av and McDowellGo  But go after 1pm when I'm gone.
670,I'm here often - usually for coffee  So while I recognize I've got a little 'local bias' in me I have no problem noting things I don't loveLiberty Market is a just a great joint  It really deserves credit for planting the first flag in the name of the blossoming downtown Gilbert foodie movement  My kids used to tell me they liked going to Liberty because their bathrooms were awesome  They're right of course but the food is pretty good too  :)To the coffee   Like many others I am sure I can rate my liveliness (if not likeability) each day on a scale of  'BC / AC' - Before Coffee / After Coffee  Liberty definitely has the best coffee bar in the area - and their stock brew is Portland's Stumptown  You can't go wrong with any of the coffee bar choices but the Ca Phe (Vietnamese) and Cortadito / Cortado (Cuban micro) are favorites as is the simple French Press  Liberty always has a super assortment of pastries to choose from should thy tooth be feeling sweeter than thy coffee  They do a great job of keeping some favorites while always adding new treats to try  I don't have a big sweet tooth but I've enjoyed the innovative griddled bread pudding and like their bisuity scones - especially vanilla with coffee  My kids go bonkers for the Salt River Bars  The pizza is on par overall with Grimaldi's which the only pizza@chain I really love  I'd rate them pretty equally because Liberty has more specialty choices  To me the crust at Liberty (and Grimaldi's) is spot-on perfect and they use fresh mozzarella to boot  The perfect pizza crust should be chewy with a crunchy crusty tooth  Also you shouldn't have to wait 5-10 mintues for an inch thick of liquid hot magma cheese to cool before you dig in and then later wonder whether you'll be able to digest it - which is a problem with typical pizza place pizza  A real pizza is spectacular right out of the fiery burning furnace and thrown on your table  That first 5-10 (10 is pushing it) is the window when a pizza is more than just a 'pizza'   It becomes more and more mundane after 5 minutes  Don't Yelp-punch me if you're from the Midwest and are screaming about Lou Malnati's or the like  That is a savory pie  It can be very delicious  But it isn't pizza  Hey I didn't make the Rules della Pizza  Naples didThe sandwiches at Liberty are very good  My favorites are the Farmer Press and the Turkey Brie  However the cold-case sides feel 'hit or miss' in my opinion (since Liberty has high standards)  My advice is to find one you like and keep going back to that well  The burgers are outstanding although I only eat a couple a year  Liberty always has some really creative specialty burgers that are worth checking out if you are a carnivoreThe fish dinners especially the specials are worth their price  Gourmet restaurant quality with great sides (I can never get enough cauliflower mash) and special saucesI used to have some gripes about Liberty breakfast - not that it was bad just that you had few alternatives to biscuits and greasy potatoes  I think the Liberty Potatoes have way too much cheese but I'm sure some may disagree  It used to bug me you could not get eggs made to order - but they appear to have changed that policy  In fact I had over-easy eggs (opposed to sunnies) yesterdaywhich brings me to ending this review with my favorite item on the current menu - the chilaquiles  They are absolutely fantastic  Salsa pequin one of the salsas they pour over the dish is one of my favorite Mexican salsas (tomatoes and tomatillos both for a tangy and earthy spice)  Liberty does the chilaquiles as well as they can be done period  The net-net recap - Liberty is a great choice for almost any taste  It gets a 5 star review from me in part for that - but also for having some items that nobody nearby really does better - coffee pizza fish - and now chilaquiles  :).
539,Love their pizzaVery fresh Their cannoli was really good tooThey seem to have great selection of wines.
3214,funny how one bad experience leads the way for all the others to fall into placethe staffing here is terrible  two people on register one making drinksand the ones at the register are clueless  i gave the girl 5 dollars to add on to my starbucks card and we purchased two drinks  she essentially pocketed 5 dollars because of her incompetence  I had 6 something pre existing on my gold card and my total came out to 9 dollars  somehow she ended up charging me twice and because the website does not reflect pre existing balance after your transaction is complete I can't go back and try and get my money back  and when I mentioned something she said no  you owe moreNEVER AGAIN TRAIN YOUR CASHIERS.
4222,If I could give less than one I would  What a joke this place is I have lived here since 1989 and never made it until last Saturday following Wicked at Gammage  I knew about the Happy Hour so the timing was perfect service is a zero food is a zero  Shrimp San Remo while it had a good flavor The shrimp were very tough and chewy  Best Seafood in AZ  Not  Baked stuffed Clams hot and the stuffing was bone dry  New England Clam Chowder very watery thin broth not many clams to be found $400 for a bread basket that you get for free everywhere else  Say what  Dining in the restaurant was all but done and the staff in the bar were more interested in socializing with each other $5500 later and NO tip I am outta there never to return  Not sure who is in charge there (rhetorical)  Attend at your own risk  I think that most of the reviewers with 5 star rating are too embarrassed to admit they paid a hundred dollars or more for Coco's quality seafood.
1837,Excellent beer and wine selection  I love that you can buy a single bottle of beer - if you want to just try something out you don't have to commit to a six-pack  Great prepared foods section - I had a hard time choosing between a sandwich soup build-your-own salad pizza and sushi (just to name a few of your options)  I opted for the sushi and was not disappointed  Fresh fish made to order  I'll definitely be returning.
4800,The food is over priced and mediocre No prices are noted on specials board We spent over 100 dollars on a meal Saturday night at another restaurant  that beat this 100 dollar one hands down The aioli starter with bread tasted like pureed tuna salad instead of an aioli The scallop dish was bland The scallops could have stood more of a sear and the fettucine should have been dressed with a blended cream and lemon instead of the heavy alfredo used on the dish Dessert was tiramisu and yes  it was bland too No taste of marsala or any other liquer soaking the cake of the tiramisu Over all this was a waste of an effort to have a good meal at a new place for us.
2290,"More than a restaurant Cafe Monarch is a Phoenix must-do-before-you-die As every review proclaims Chris is a culinary maven who makes every experience unique and custom to the preferences and tastes of his clienteleThis is by no means a large restaurant the dining room fits maybe 5-7 small tables with views of the chef at work constructing off the cuff dishes And while the idea is that you sit close together with other people--this is a neighborhood restaurant after all you don't feel crammed among strangersDefinitely make reservations for dinner and be sure to tell Chris about any dietary restrictions We stopped in for brunch yesterday at 11:30 but were easily enticed by the lunch menu displayed on the daily chalk board Gruyere and cheddar grilled cheese with spicy chipotle tomato soup was the perfect meal for a wintery afternoon Still hungry Sure Chris whipped up a chicken dish lightly seasoned with chopped eggplant and sweet black rice which was enough for 2 but technically was for us to ""split"" only charging us for 3 plates total A choice of iced tea or Cafe du Monde coffee was offered and we chose the iced tea infused with hibiscus and other fruity flavors perfectly flavored yet unsweetened Dinner runs about $50 a plate and bunch/lunch $20 Cash ONLY and BYOB ($10 corkage fee) Perfect for out of town guests special occasions or if just you're craving delectable food Even though it's becoming well-known it feels like a secret place you discover every time you go."
2957,I never win Except once but the macine was broken They took their money back Now I'm sad Thanks for reminding me.
5,"Ok so the grand opening hasn't even happened yet for this place but sorry Im gonna miss it  NotA group of eight of us show up tonight for ""dinner"" and drinks  We get seated way the hell in the back  I guess we didn't fit in with the rest of the crowd  Two graphic designers three filmmakers a photographer and some friends ok  The reason I point this out is that the waiter lets us know that this place isn't that classy of a place like LeBoca so the people are well less classy The guy was digging himself a holeSo we order drinks which seem to take about 10minutes to get to our table  In the mean time we're looking at our menu and the waiter leaves again for about 10min he finally shows up and we order from this tiny little menu   My girlfriend and I order some tacos and chips with guacamole everyone else orders something a bit similar  Conversation is picking up while we wait for our food  I see people coming and going and that's when we notice that our food is taking too damn long  Finally after eating our small plate of chips and guacamole our food arrives Probably about 45min later  Here's the best partSo the food shows up and after waiting for 45minutes we get these tiny little tacos that look like they are from the menu of a 2 year old  That's right each of the three tacos are literally two bites at most each  Everyone eats their dinner in about 5minutes max  patheticAfter our tiny little dinner we ask for our billsThe waiter doesn't think to bring all our bills at once no instead he brings one or two at a time Guess he wants us to stick around Who knows Finally the two filmmakers get their bill pay and they leave couple other of our friends do the same  My friend and I stay with our other friend who's still waiting on his bill  He gets it and notices that his $15 meal was just charged $30 on his credit card  He complains and the waiter vanishes for about 20minutes to fix his card  When he comes back he gives some crap about fixing it and giving him a credit guess how much Oh about 50 cents He signed the slip and the remaining three of us left this crappy placeThe place actually does look pretty cool  Too bad the service sucks and the food is barely appetizer quality at best."
3313,Worst massage EVER They were 5 minutes late and had me leave 5 minutes early(Sounds like less than an hour) Then I asked for a deep tissue massage and they gave me a little dainty chick that couldn't squash a grape in a fruit fight And then when it's all done you get to head back to the lobby and get the biggest sales pitch of your life NEWS FLASH You can get $40 massage's all day on groupon There are better places you just have to look.
2477,Just ate there Saturday night  Food is excellent  I had the lobster tacos with Mer Soliel Chardonnay  What a perfect combination  One of the people with me has the peel and eat shrimp loved it and the other person I was with love the healthy burrito  Service was awesome ambience is a bit loud.
2736,"I really fucking hate places like Lone Star As you can tell from the name the cheap gimmicky theme here is ""Texas"" You have stupid waitresses walking around with cowboy hats and t-shirts that say ""Don't Mess with Texas"" and who are instructed to say ""Howdy y'all"" when you walk in The food is a notch above Burger King if that The decor is the same shit they plaster over every other restaurant of this genre but with slight variations for Greek (My Big Fat Greek Restaurant) Mexican (Macayo's) and Just Plain Stupid-Ass (TGI Friday's) So yeah this is basically the Texas equivalent of TGI Fridays Does that appeal to you Does it turn you on Then please go there eat your stupid generic burger/burrito/gyro/chicken tenders and leave me the hell alone Just please please I beg you never force me to come here again the way you did today."
1508,This is a great place My fiance and I decided that if we lived anywhere close to Phoenix we would be there all the time probably almost every day Their website boasts 80+ beers 20 wines 3 sakes 10+ organic brews & wines and off-the-grid wine They live up to their boasting Keep in mind that she and I could be considered to be beer snobs crossed with beer adventurists The Lost Leaf filled our need for cool microbrews that we like a lot as well as cool stuff we had never had The bartender with very knowledgeable too which is always a plus in a place like this They have great art on the walls most of which I think is for sale They often have events going on as well When we were there a figure drawing event was happening They also have a poetry open mic live music a DJ and a bunch of other stuff It's definitely worth checking out.
599,QQ Grill closed it's doors two months ago.
3573,Not enough women's bathrooms to accomodate female audience wheras men breeze right in Female donors They will have none Further the acoustics are terrible Just guess the lines.
4698,"Service by the waitress (Laura) and cleanliness were fair  Problem became when I had asked for my eggs to be scrambled with the cheese in them while they cook not melted on top of the eggs after  Laura assured me no problem  Eggs came out and the cheese had been melted on top after the eggs had been cooked and then mixed up with a forkLaura asked if they could remake the eggs and I politely responded that I just never feel comfortable sending food back  Asked if they would just charge me for the pancakes bacon and coffee  Again she asked if they could remake the eggs  I said no thanks and she responded she would get the managerManager came over asked if they could remake the eggs and I again responded no thank you  She said they would take the eggs off the bill  Brings the bill and in fact did not take the eggs off but also instead of charging me the $100 upcharge for the bacon that came with the meal charged me $299 for a side of baconI had to ask for the manager to come back and argue with her about the charge for the bacon and have her bring over a menu to show her the upcharge was only $100  (She apparently as a manager does not know their own menu)  She gave up at trying to listen to me at this point and just said ""Well we are just comping the meal""Very annoying  I am always happy to pay for what I eat but shouldn't be charged for food that was not prepared as requestedWon't be back."
438,I beg to differ dude  Here on holiday and let's just say Chompie's is better than the average chipotle lovin brain boiling sad excuse for a seafood restaurant place in BFE (AZ)I've only been to this one location and from the taste of it it was one of a kind  The first time we went I got the latkes (yum best ones I've had that weren't home cookin) and the second time I went for the hot pastrami sandwich (so good)  The bread was a little soggy so if you go for it do it right and ask for the bread to be extra toasty  Overall good place  I wish we had a nice reasonably priced jewish deli where we lived.
3605,I do not believe that this is a good dry cleaners  If you want to find out then go and hopefully you have a better experience  The left a stain on my collared shirt and all of my white collared shirts then cleaned but didn't iron  They were all super wrinkled when I got them back  Some sort of weird joke.
4310,"I have never heard of Via Delosantos but my sister told me the food was amazing and she was shocked I have never heard of this place While I was waiting to be seated I pulled up Yelp on my phone and started reading reviews Arik B's review was funny as hell but also scared the shit out of me The chips and salsa were good but not great The rice and beans were blah The vegetarian chalupa had a lot of guacamole on it topped off with lettuce and cheese I can't believe they even serve this on the menu it's horrible My cheese enchilada topped of with their white queso sauce was really good so if I ever get dragged to this place again I will order that During dinner my sister mentioned that she has seen roaches in the restaurant while she was eating and In my head I was thinking "" Dammit Arik B was right""."
2241,The wings are absolutely amazing They made me feel like carnivore Yum Tacos are also very good People are nice and friendly Service is on point So far I'm in love.
3834,"Had heard good things about Churchill's but was very disappointed on my first visitWent with family to celebrate a birthday dinner at 3:30 on a Saturday afternoon There were only two other parties in the place  In spite of the dead slow time the waitress refused to help us split up a check (""You ordered appetizers and those are too hard to split"" Huh) and seemed relatively uninterested in us most of the time we were thereI wasn't super hungry so asked to get the lunch portion of the Bangers & Mash after she talked about their homemade sausages She said I couldn't do that on a weekend but I'd want the dinner portion anywayThat dinner portion had a pile of fairly tasty homemade potatoes but only three halves of sausages  Not three sausages three HALVES cut lengthwise So 1 1/2 bangers for a dinner portion  That's not banging that's barely mild thumping And they were curled up from being overcooked They seemed like they could have been tasty had they been cooked decentOh and the dinner special fried chicken  All out for the day At 3:30  Seems like if you're going to run a dinner special and have it on your special's board you should I dunno HAVE the special in the kitchen somewhereMy Guinness was also flat when I got it and as I think about it I started this review with two stars but I'm going down to one  An English pub that can't nail a Guinness and Bangers & Mash might want to rethink their priorities I haven't been this disappointed in a pub in a long time and I won't be back  Blech."
4344,So I go into this walmart (on Thomas) at 8:30 last night I am always reluctant to use a cart or basket for fear of what I'll catch so when I do I always grab a few cleaning towels and wipe down the object of contagion None there The lady who was greeting people while sitting down turned away as I was fumbling among the empty containers I gave up: I was probably already infected I shopped gawked at the patrons asked a couple of employees questions that they couldn't comprehend and left about $2000 lighter  As I was walking back to my car I watched a woman who had changed her child's diaper in the back of her van look both ways and toss it under her car  I drove to the IHOP a few blocks away and washed up relieved to know that I might now survive waltonitis I carefully wiped down anything I had touched and have finally decided that I will NEVER shop at walmart again I can do without dangerous uncivilized behaviorZERO STARS FOR THIS DUMP.
752,Had to try this place and I will definitely be going back I got the Vasito de Elote which was just as good as on the Cobb It was an appetizer so the portion was prefect maybe 4ozThey make the guacamole at your table It's different from how I make it smashed They dice the avacado add everything and even pomegranate Lime juice is freshly squeezed I saw them at the bar squeezing it  for my micheladas which was also good and only $4 Suizas enchilada- $15 The smell of them reminded me of my nanas homemade corn tortillas And the Tomatillo sauce on it was just the right spicy I will def go again All staff was nice and very helpful We even bought a shot glass$350 and a T shirt$20.
4284,how is this place in business  the only thing good I can say about it is it was soo bad it made us leave and we found an amazing place  no names mentioned but you can read my reviewsservice was non-existant and the place was not well kept at all  We left after one short drink  Too much wrong to listjust skip this one.
3048,Great place to pull up on yer' Hawg and enjoy a break in your ride All or Most are Discovery channel bikers though Some great bikes to look at if you are in to HD's Great pizza and spicy bloody Mary's If you ride up on yer' sled watch your pipe noise as Cave Creek has an 84 DB limit law and they will write you up.
2494,It took us forever to finally get our butts in seats at MBB because frankly we aren't early risers and it gets crowded Well we should dragged our butts out of bed The food was great and well priced I have always wanted to try their waffle but also felt like having an omelet and potatoes So I had my omelet and potatoes and my fiancee got the waffle Best of both worlds The service was good the ambiance is friendly parking is easy It's a great local spot the kind that you take visitors toif you can get out of bed And you should I have other things on the menu I need to try.
3437,service awful menu changed  They charge for onions and peppers in potatoes there cream of corn is awful there is an herb in it and they do not tell you what it is and they say they do not know  Also there is no bread basket you have to ask for it the food portions like pork chops has no bone it is small and the augratin potatoes is white not baked and awful.
2414,Great quality meals at respectable prices and extremely fast service My wife and I go here as often as we can (we try not to eat out too much for budget reasons) and the staff are always attentive The food is high quality and tasty My personal favorite items is the Pop Eye Scrambler with Avocado: it is eggs scrambled with onionavocadobaby spinach and bacon For two adults with drinks and meals runs us on average about $26 after a 20% tip for the great staff Highly recommend this place.
1752,"We didn't get our normally great rate that my travel agent wife is able to secure but wanted to get away and thought to stay here anyway  What makes a resort world class or 5 star  yeah the property needs to be well cared for and of course clean but more importantly are its people  From the moment we arrived and asked for the nearest restroom their response:  it's up the escalator passed the second set of elevators to your left don't forget second set of elevators but more importantly ""welcome""  and welcome I did feel every interaction after that was just as warm and pleasant  They made me feel like I expected and then some given how much their rates are  The furniture  the art the backdrop and the amenities were all high class  The kids swam in the pool slid down the slide a hundred times we shot some hoops played ping pong borrowed the bikes and watched some men shank their balls on the beautifully manicured golf course or watched tennis pros give out lessons all within the comfort of this grand resort  Camelback mountain provides a great backdrop and next time will serve as a great place to hike too for us :) We will definitely return  the service was as we say in our hood off the chain :)."
4249,If you own a Mexican restaurant how on earth can you mess up beans  There's nothing worse than going to a Mexican restaurant and their beans have no flavor WHAT-SO-EVER  To add to my disappointment the chicken tacos I ordered were saturated with grease and lacked flavor too  I hope the owner reads this because she needs to have the cook taste the food he's preparing before they serve it  Salt is your friend Maybe even some pepper and garlic if you're adventurous  Thank God for the little bit of salsa they gave me it was the only thing to make my tacos edible  I ended up tossing the frijoles in the garbage  What a waste of food.
4330,"Ok I do not understand the cult following that this place has I grew up in Mesa and have been dragged to this place several times only to wonder ""WHY"" The food is ridiculously hot - not yummy hot - just hot I like hot food but I want food that is delicious and digestable The service sucks and the prices are a rip off."
4922,I always have customer service problems with Fedex  How the heck did they get to be so big with the crappy way they treat customers  I use the Internet a lot for purchases and about 60% of the time they screwed-up and then their customer service has major difficulty fixing the problems  I have asked for shipments to be held at the closet shipping location to my office and they ship to my home  Another time I asked for the same thing and they held it at the regional depot instead of where I asked that it be sent  I can go on and on about the screw-ups I have experienced with Fedex  But this time they really pissed me off  I get a harassing phone calls from a collection agency that says they have been contracted by Fedex to collect an overdue bill from me in the amount of $4000+  I have asked them for details and all I get is harassment  So I asked Fedex for help and customer service told me to contact Fedex Revenue Services which I did  I told them that I am getting harassing phone calls from XYZ collection agency and the person who keeps calling is named Chris  I also tell them that the alleged amount owed is $4000+ and the account is supposedly in my name  So I ask that they investigate and tell me if I indeed have an overdue account in my name for this amount  (I know I do not have such an account)  Fedex then tells me that they cannot help me because I have not provided enough information  WTF  How much more information can I provide  Do they want my height and weight  Maybe my blood type  Maybe I have to provide the names and birth dates of my children tooThis is why I say that Fedex really blows.
3962,While we've had numerous opportunities to try other Humble Pie locations we've always opted for something else There are much better pizzas in the valley (even on the west side) The pizza was cold and bland The service was lousy  We were incredibly disappointed and won't be going back.
4100,"I ordered today a delivery order and was told it would be about 45 minutesAn hour and a half later I called back to check on the order and was informed ""the guy is on his way"" and then was hung up on I called back and asked what the delay was and had the food been driving around for the past hour or what's going on  I was told ""look u want the food or not I just don't care I will cancel the order if you want"" I DO CAREI asked to speak with owner or manager and was told ""look nobody cares so take it or leave it""RUDE and RUDENOT Recommended."
2828,Firebirds how I love thee You deliver the perfect piece of meat everytime - whether prime rib sirloin or ribeye Because of this I don't even know what other proteins you serve nor do I care You always have room for me to sit near the grill where the smell is devine Your wait staff is well-informed and happy to be at their job But surprisingly my favorite thing about you is your loaded baked potato I'm not sure how the skin is so crisp and salty and the toppings more fresh and mouth-watering than your steak Yes you are expensive and I do not care for your fat-ridden del Monaco But we should love our favorites unconditionally.
2611,Best Hawaiian in town this place was a staple for me in the college years  I could live off the manapua  The humble decor leaves you in for an even better surprise when you taste the food  Had a friend that lived in Hawaii for several years and he said the food here was just like home  They have music on some days and advertise cultural events happening in the valley  Fun cheap good eats.
4937,This place was terrible  I came in here for the first time and they rushed throughout the whole service and was VERY rude when you asked them to correct something  The guy who was doing my nails did not buff out my nails and only put nail polish on half of my nail  I can understand mistakes can happen however being RUDE TO THE PAYING CUSTOMER IS INEXCUSABLE Here's a tip to the owner---TREAT YOUR CUSTOMERS BETTER & GET SOME TRAINING ON HOW TO GIVE PROPER MANICURES.
2489,Update Aug 2013I made this review got a response from a manager replied to him and then nothing more I forgot about it as it didn't matter to me anymore A few months later I got a call from a woman manager who said she apologizes they didn't see that I had replied to another manager's comment to my original 1-star review She was embarrassed so much time had passed She said the actually listened realized managerial influence was light at closing and don't know things had gotten this way They actually appreciated my constructive criticism & have CHANGED things at closing That is actually what I HOPE FOR with every not-good review I leave She enticed me to come back with a thank you gift for me at the desk Already used some of it good for herRitz Carlton knows that the best way to make a customer for life is to take a bad situation and make it RIGHT makes people even more devoted than when everything goes fine Seems Changing Hands has done some loyal customer homework.
1843,First time live down the street and decided to stop in for a beer  The comdedian on Monday nights was talking about carrying weapons and how funny that is  The bartender was dressed in a tie but don't let it fool you he's not polite  At one point he was threatening me with violence to leave the establishment  No reason  But beware this place feels creepy and sketchy  The beer was okay but a bit over priced and less than I would expect from a gambling establishment  My take on the place there is no way I would cross their threshold again.
2000,FREDS SCOTTSDALE  Great place quiet atmosphere no kids no teensdining in this is the place to just relax and enjoy  The staff the chefs andthe management is great   The food is wonderful i recommend this place all the time  You will not be disappointed at all.
2530,"I have driven by Sierra Bonita a million times while doing business in Central Phoneix and kept saying to myself: ""Self: -gotta try it""  Now I am pretty upset with myself that it took so long Note to other reviewers: this is not a Mexican restaurant It is not fast food It's a Southwestern dinner housewarm welcoming and comfortable We are still talking about our evening and intend to take the entire family back for an event soon (cant wait) Our service was stellar and I am sorry I don't remember her name She was so friendly and had a great personalitynever acted like she was in a hurry She had great drink and Tequila suggestions The drinks were fresh and strong We ordered the red chili Mac and cheese appetizer - which was a very liberal portion for two people My husband's eyes rolled back in his head and he not only polished off every bitehis finger finished off the sauce left in the panFor my entree I ordered the stuffed Poblano - also an appetizer but it was perfect It is served in a small skillet on very flavorful retired beans and really GOOD homemade tortillasnice large and stretchyjust like Abuelita made them My husband had the red chili pork roast and loved itgreat smoky flavorWe had such a nice dinner that we stepped over to compliment the gentleman at the door who turned out to be the ownerreally a nice charming guy I love it when the owner of the place acts like he is hosting a party and having a good time himself  - and that was my impression When we told him where we live he was surprised Heck we would drive twice the distanceand we will as soon as I can."
1561,Great Persian restaurant  Tasty rich food great friendly service and nice decor  What else can you ask for  Try their combination plattersall meats have great flavors tender and well presented  When it says it serves 2 people there are actually enough food for 3-4  Don't forget to save room for desserts  Persian (rose water) ice cream with baklava is my personal favorite  It also looks like they give you a free dessert for your birthday.
2719,So good Couldn't rate it anything less than 5*.
1613,The BEST veggie pizza I have ever has in my life I'm not a vegetarian The flavor is nice and strong not wimpy like most Teen son tried it & asked to keep the rest of the slice - crazy good for anyone His black bean quesadilla & side salad was delicious & neither of us love black beans Our service was great red haired younger woman very friendly & helpful Great world music playing LOVED IT We felt energized by the good quality food environment & company  Wish they were closer to usNo it's not cheap - but that quality of ingredients isn't cheap for them to buy.
3113,My friend and I came in some weeks ago about end of August after attending a funeral service on that side of town  The service was overall bad and the waiter argued with us about the amount of cheese that was on the order from my friend  So we flagged down the manager to complain  The result was that he explained that the district manager was there and the ice machine was doneI was like thinking my friend works in the medical field and has to keep a good customer service attitude when people are throwing up on him so that explanation didn't seem adequate to me but oh well they were going to comp us one slice of pie in addition to the two free slices we ordered from their promotionWhen we checked out it took 1/2 hour to pay the bill in addition NO Pieces of Pie were comped out Explanation -- the types of pie we chose were not in the free offer although we had asked the server about the time limit on the free pie I guess he would not let us in on the secret that the TYPES we chose were not free and now in addition to NOT getting comped as a nicety for the arguing we weren't even given ANY free pie at all  They gave us ONE free $2 iced tea  And TOOK an extraordinary long time to do this  We stood outside in the heat and talked after because the atmosphere of bad service inside was so bad lolOverall I would avoid this location  There are plenty of other restaurant choices nearby when I am on this side of town.
4818,The only good thing I can say about this place is the bean dip is good Cold food no flavor and crappy service.
3929,Very poor customer service Refuses to see patients during normal business hours Has a VERY high turnover rate  Three different chiropractors have come and went at this location during the past 6 months So there is no consistency with treatment New receptionist every few months Tries to sucker you into a huge treatment plan that will cost a couple thousand dollars Not worry they offer financing (sarcastic tone) This is a sham chiropractic business that is more concerned about getting your money than actually treating your ailment Will never go back Find a real chiropractor that isn't money hungry.
4998,WHOEVER RUNS THIS PLACE SHOULD BE FIREDWent here for the Eric Church concert and there was literally a will-call/entry line for 2+  hours  They are seriously understaffed/have just 2 will call windows the guys checking IDs were soooooooo slow/drunk/chewing a wad of tobacco about the size of a baseball  The beer lines were shameful  No air conditioning Can only use your credit card one time () so have to have a tab etc  Overall an ugly black mark on the Scottsdale/Phoenix music scene  I'd be ashamed to play here/own this place.
2374,Unfortunately this establishment is the worst Panda I have been to They had only one server/cashier at 6pm for the dinner rush On top of that the guy barely spoke English and had several issues when ordering :( sad.
436,I love this place just across the street from my work I go here alot The sandwich's here are AMAZING The only complaint is the wait and delivery time is LONGtry the white widow or tia stick.
2898,I think The Chuck Box has been around since the time my dad went to ASU which was many many years agoWhen I was living in AZ I would come here occasionally & I've been here a couple times over the past few years when I've been in town for a visitThe burgers (and BBQ chicken sandwiches) at The Chuck Box are DELICIOUS  If you like burgers & can care less ambiance/atmosphere then come here  If ambiance/atmosphere mean a great deal to you then you might as well stop reading this review & ignore the five starsLike I said the burgers & BBQ sandwiches are fantastic (and according to my mom and sister the hot dogs are as wellthey're served cut in half on hamburger buns)  Everything is grilled to order so it all tastes fresh  A couple things at The Chuck Box that I think get overlooked because of the burgers are the sidesparticularly the fried mushrooms & zucchini  I don't know what it but the mushrooms in particular are to die for  In addition there's a large condiment bar w/plenty of fixings w/anything you can think to put on a burger including ranch dressing which is perfect for the mushrooms & zucchini  The place itself isn't much to look at but who cares  There's only one person taking orders as you walk in and there's often times a line almost out the door  They also just call orders out as they're ready not necessarily in the order as they were placed so things can gets a little helter-skelter but in the end it's all good and the Chuck Box is as good as it gets.
4820,No wi-fi and the manager doesn't know the password to access it If you need a spot with wireless Internet this is not the place.
4027,i went in to purchase stamps  I was not told how much the service charge would be beforehand and didn't know until it was rung up  I didn't look at the stamps until I got back to my office and found that all of the stamps were at the old rate of $45  Now I have to go to the post office and purchase $01 stamps  Hopefully they are informed and using the current rates for their other shipping services.
4428,Oregano's you are vile and I am baffled by your crowds of followers who seem willing to loiter about in 115 degree heat for over an hour for you Everything tastes as if someone had an accident with the salt shaker in the kitchen Bland boring and dehydrating No thanks.
4941,Sorry but once again I don't get it This is a nice place salsa out of pumpsoh you fancy huh This is within walking distance from the new pad I went against my better judgementkicking and screaming mind you Decided to give this place another go or 5maybe this location is better The first time we tried it they were closed the second time we barely made it No carne asada No chile relleno Why God why must you toy with me This place is NOT the best placethe green sauce isn't green at all it's GREY people You know what makes it that color Flourmore like gravy You like the tortillas I could care less really its a super large thin tortilla there's nothing special about it CALM DOWN The kid behind the counter tells me to try the breakfast thats their specialty My 3rd Carolinas attempt was for breakfast and once again I was very underwhelmed I have tried basically everything on the menu all this stuff is pretty basic and a major let down The rice and beans are good fyi.
1174,My home internet was recently down so in order to get online I packed up my laptop and headed to this coffee shop just down the street from my house Not being a coffee drinker I can only say that the hot chocolate was very good As others have mentioned the work space is great Fast internet connection large table in the center with power strips and individual tables with great power hookups all around the room I think I even recognized some fellow Yelpers.
1851,This place is legit Straight-up dive pool hall And I LOVE itI came here with a friend for the first time last week to shoot some pool The place was pretty busy and it seemed to have a good amount of regulars One guy even offered to help us out since it was our first time there Get here early if you want a 8-foot table Best part - to get a rack for a table is only $3 for the entire nightWe showed up around 10 and since the tables were taken we jumped on a 7 foot table and played a few The drinks were good and cheapish and the bartender was really friendly- always adds a star in my book I'll definitely be back here.
1348,Can't believe I never reviewed this particular B Dubs Being right across the street from my work I spent many lunch hours here eating Buffalitos or wings playing trivia and catching up on the previous night's games  Quite a few Sundays as well since I'm a Bears fan and my girlfriend loves the Steelers so we had to end up somewhere we could both catch our gamesLove the Buffalitos They are tacos except with grilled chicken and your favorite wing sauce I usually went with hot but you almost couldn't go wrong with any flavor  Served with chips and salsa it made a great lunch when you didn't feel like gettin messy with the wingsNow that I have moved to the Chicago area I'm really gonna miss this place  Good thing there are B Dubs all over around here as well.
4657,I always loved Johnny Rockets the food the fun - my daughter always gets up and dances with the crew Tonight- not so much - The service was horible They lost our order and the manager didn't even have the courage to come out and appologize They gave me a pathetic discount which didn't begin to make up for the 1/2 hour I lost this evening The worst part for me was I was in a great mood when I went there even though we waited for 20 minutes to get in But it's hard to maintain your cool when you people around you who came in 15 minutes after you get served first I understand that mistakes happen believe me they happen to me in my business all the time That's when the manager has to come over and own up to the error and appologize If you go there share this review with them and maybe they will improve because the food really is good and normally I like the place a lot but shame on them tonight.
4398,No stars  It's amazing that Pebbletec allows Prado to install their product because of their poor workmanship and no customer service skills  We have been waiting to receive a reply from them for months now to no avail  Use another vendor you'll thank yourself in the future.
3770,I was in this location on November 9 2013 I waited about 15 minutes to be helped A nice young girl at the register was trying to finally help me when her manager LIZ via the earbuds asked her to stop helping me She had to immediately walk away and go back to the register (Which seemed uncesssary to me when there were 2 other employees working the registers without a line)I proceeded to talk with LIZ and she apologized that I was inconvenienced yet did not offer to help answer my questions or even walk over to assist me choosing my daughter's first make-up compact I needed professional care and she could have cared less Maybe she could have requested the young employee return to the register after she finished helping meI gave her my bags of items I wanted to purchase and walked out (After I told her how poor her decision was and treating her employee and me poorly)The next day I went to another Ulta in Chandler AZ and the male manager was so kind He was appauled by LIZ's behavior and said this is not the policy of Ulta I write this to warn you that if you go to this Ulta location you will receive poor customer service By the way it would help if Ulta would be better about keeping enough item of their own brand cosmetics in stock It seems every time I go they have a poor selection.
1966,I don't know what sort of seasoning they use for the chicken and steak shawarma but I thought it was disgusting  The gyro was decent and the baklava was ok.

2713,This place is the bombbest place to hangout awesome mix drink coffee and the service is the best.
4965,"I initially went to the Gordon Biersch in Tempe and was not impressed as their beers were flavorless  However my wife and I live within walking distance of this Gordon Biersch and a few months ago went there for a snack and a drink  I can't recall what I had (it was a seasonal) but it actually tasted like a decent beer  So my opinion was beginning to change  until a few weeks agoMy wife and I are from Indianapolis and we wanted to go somewhere to watch the Colts vs Bills game  We walked to GB arriving at 11:30 am (the game started at 11)  There were a total of 6 people in the restaurant taking up 2 separate tables 1 inside and 1 outside  None of the 6 people were remotely interested in any of the football games showing on the various tvs  My wife and I sat at the outside bar and asked the bartender if she could switch a tv to the Colts game as it was not on any of the tvs  She said someone had called in and requested the game showing on that tv  (I think it was Cincy)  I asked if they could change a different tv or put the Cincy game on another tv  I also remarked that no-one was here it was 11:30 and my wife and I were there and ready to spend money  She said she had to ask the Manager  The bartender returned - yes bartender - not the manager - and said ""the manager said we cannot change the channels since someone called in and requested the games""  I laughed and said ""well we are here ready to spend money""  Keep in mind there were multiple tvs - in the remote chance the Cincy fans arrived and wanted that game on that particulary tv there were other tvs that were not being watched that could have accomodated us or the Cincy fans  Again - only 6 people in the entire restaurant with multiple tvs - just none of them showing the Colts  (and the hapless Cards were not playing until later in the day at home)  The bartender was very professional and annoyed at the manager's decision but said there was nothing she could do  So we left  I thought it was poor management that the manager refused to change the channel and also did not have the courage to come tell usInteresting note we called BJ's and asked if they had the Colts game on  They said ""no but we will put it on any channel you want""  Guess who we gave our business to  I think we spent about $50 not counting tip."
1730,"I had a bad address for today's restaurant outing & ended up warily sticking my head in the door at this nearly windowless place  I was promptly greeted by ""Mother"" (in her 70s)  I liked her & she told me they have been there for 32 years so I decided to give it a tryThis is a cozy comfortable dimly lit place & there were already a lot of customers well before noon  I started with the ""all-you-can-eat"" salad bar where there was a lot to choose from but you have to fit it ""all"" on a small plate & you only get one trip so I stacked it up like Mt Vesuvius  For the entree I ordered an open-face hot turkey sandwich which comes with mashed potatoes & cranberry sauceWhile waiting for the sandwich I was anticipating only 2 or 3 Stars for this place & frankly wishing I had gone somewhere else because I was annoyed by the ""one trip"" salad bar rule but then my main course arrived  OMG it's HUGE  :-))   It was totally delicious too as was the generous serving of mashed potatoes & also the cranberry sauceWhat a great lunch this turned out to be & it's probably a good thing you only get one trip to the salad bar because Mother here feeds you what amounts to ""all you can eat"" by the time it's over with anyway  My server was great too & it was only $828 for the whole shebang  Yum."
3600,AWFUL I have NEVER received such terrible service in my LIFE I cannot express to you just how important it is for you to go elsewhere I spent $700 on a my sub zero ( which is fine if it were fixed) They had to come out 5 times to even diagnose what was wrong Also they would only give 4 hour chunks of time for when they would service that is WHEN they show up Thats right they just no showed after rearranging our work/kids schedules When giving the owner Donna an opportunity to address the issue it was a joke She took absolutely NO responsibility no remorse in fact she didnt even call me back or respond to voice mails I have never been so insulted and disrespected by a business Very unfortunate.
451,Ok so they've been open for a while now The menu is slowly expanding but I thought I would add some comments about the food Wow Not typical pub food They have a quality menu Everything is fresh They don't even have a freezer in the buildingThe burgers compete with the best burgers at any specialty burger joint Delicious beef blend is my favorite but the chicken burger is surprisingly good and the black bean burger is an excellent option for those wanting to pretend its more healthyHouse made chips are a great side but no match for the duck fat fries The only problem is they're so rich you really can't eat a whole basket by yourself I'm not a dessert guy but the connoli nachos are out of this world Again so rich you have to shareThe wings are non-traditional drumsticks that are huge meat lollipops There's only 6 but there's a ton of meat on these babies and both sauce options BBQ and a sweet and spicy are outstanding I think a brew pub has to have both good beer (duh) AND good food -- and AZW delivers strong in both categories.
1079,I could not ask for better This is the only car place that has not tried adding more to my bill Not just once but everytime I go there the gentleman is always looking out for me and not how much more they can get cause im a woman They don't try to sell me anything that is not neededI am a loyal customer.
3960,"Northlight their front counter employees and their office manager seem to be more interested in getting your money than they are in getting you better They are one of those companies who catch phrases are ""You owe us $____"" and ""Our policy is _____"" I was actually starting to establish a good rapport with the providers I was working with if they moved to a different company I would seek them out but never EVER again will I consider dealing with Northlight Counseling In fact Lindsey the office manager was always extremely combative and added to my depression and during our last interaction actually suggested that I ""Find another company who's policies I approve of"" In my opinion that's not very sensitive handling of a patient who is in need of help with depression anxiety and suicidal thoughts I've been to numerous counseling places and have never been told to get lost before I will miss working with Dr Hicks he is a very good psych and I will miss working with Dr Davidson as well but when the office that is supposed to be helping you starts turning into the reason that you need to go there it's time to get out."
1935,Been back a few times since and have had nothing but great experiences Our last visit was awesome because it was later on Saturday night and wasn't very busy at all Our waiter was really chill Lol I don't really know what adjective to use for him He was really quiet and reserved but he was also one of the best waiters ever Tons of refills he was there when we needed him and there was no forced small talk or unnecessary words It's like he could see into our souls Almost like he knew us better than we knew ourselves :OI have no idea what his name was but yeah he was pretty awesome The passion fruit iced tea was pretty good and he even offered iced teas to go before we even thought of asking for any Yeah I pretty much peed a lot that night way too much tea (If there is such a thing)That last experience really prompted me to bring this up to a 5 star rating I love Pita Jungle but other locations usually annoy me a bit This one is just too awesome :).
4059,"Horrible 1 Loud noise kept me up past 4am I thought the thumping bass was bad UNTIL they started breaking down the party Slamming doors moving metal carts (in stereo -outside the window AND door) loading the truck literally until half past 4am2 Management apologized over and over but did nothing Said they would call to discuss compensation but never did3 There's a $20 service fee which amounts to chips and soda and it's kept behind the check-in counter4 Incident in restaurant below had people running from building Firefighters sirens and police everywhere Sounded like shots ringing out Phone in room rang and assumed we had to evacuate People thought there was a shooting but apparently it was firecrackers and rocks being thrown into the building Not relaxing Did not feel safe It was literally featured on the local news that night I shared a very similar experience to Barbara N I actually heard a guest at the front desk leaving say: ""I want to stay at a hotel not a club"" In fact this hotel does feel like a cheap cheesy club Think Tampa - not upscale Miami Also the one and only elevator is slow as molasses and most people used to stairs even when carrying luggage I would NOT return to this hotel or recommend it to anybody I know."
4948,the service was horrible We walked in & they looked at us like we were from another planet One guy (the cook) couldn't help not taking his eyes off us which was very uncomfortable No one said anything to us for a couple of minutes not a hello or anything Finally a female host came & sat us I will say she was the only polite warm & friendly person in there to us We couldn't help but notice the service others were getting around us It seems to me they were a bit more friendly to other guest On our way out we did not get a thank you goodbye or please come again RUDE RUDE RUDE The my fries were cold & hard.
3578,Yuck How can any Mexican joint have absolutely no flavor in their meat I really wanted to like this since it's close by and I'm all about 24 hour fast food Bummer.
3883,"unbelievable thats what i have to say about scottsdale lanes this saturday morning arrived at 11:15 am to bowl on the special for 2 hours for $1300  was given a lane by a very unprofessional person at the counter (customer service is not there specialty) went to lane 21 and started bowling bowled a few games with my new ball then whamo the ball doesn't come back on lane 22 was another person bowling and whamo their ball doesn't come back both balls are stuck in the pit and not returning to the rack on the lane i went up to the counter and told them that both balls have not returned and the person at the counter said"" i'll tell the manager waited l0 minutes nothing happened finally the manager(a large woman) goes back to retreive the balls waited 10 more minutes and she finally comes back and states ""sorry i can't get the balls out of the pit i tell her to get the mechanic to get them and she says ""i don't have a mechanic today to do that"" unbelievable what kind of bowling lanes don't have a mechanic on duty on a saturday she tells me to throw another ball down the lane and all the balls will return to the rack so i throw a ball down the lane  the woman on lane 22 also throws a ball down the lane  now there are 4 balls stuck in the pit on lanes 21&22 again i tell her 4 balls are now stuck she gets upset and calls the mechanic on her cellphone  she goes back to retrieve the balls and finally after 37 minutes of waiting the balls finally return to the rack  she comes back to my lane and says she is sorry about the delay nothing more nothing less  i tell her i'm not happy about the delay and she again states she is sorry but is not willing to do anything else to please me or the person on lane 22 i tell her i'm done bowling and i want my money back she walks away and tells me again that she is sorry and i'm not getting my money back talk about lousy customer service the people that work here don't know what the word ''customer service'' means what a terrible place to go bowling this place has terrible customer service and lousy employees that work there never again will i ever bowl there again but i'm telling everyone i know about my experience."
4298,"I fly a lot on business out of PHX  Mostly to TX and CA  I only fly US Air when I absolutely have to usually to destinations in CA SJV Valley  They used to be pretty good when they were America West  After the US Air merger I've noticed a deterioration in flight service and customer care  My colleagues have dubbed it ""U Suck Airways""Hopefully they will get better after a merger/buyout of American but if history is a guide they probably won't  All the poor reviews in these postings are true uncomfortable seats mechanical problems costly change fees etcThe only good thing  Their fares are still pretty cheap  I guess you get what you pay forI had over 100k miles with US Air at one point now I'm a Southwest convert  Once you learn Southwest's boarding system it's a breeze  Definitely a better airline than US Air."
3685,This place has great pizza but they have no respect for Giants spring training fans So save your money and go to Oregano's where they are not pretentious.
2558,Wonderful place I cannot say enough  good about Postinos Great food love the chicken salad:) Happy hour 11-5  (seven days a week) who doesn't  like that  Service is always perfect You will not regret your visit its a must :).
3173,Is this a joke I literally eat the single worst shrimp scampi dish I have ever had in my life I then asked for a pasta dish with chicken The sauce was terrible and the chicken was very rough In addition the pasta was still a bit undercooked Awful.
2803,Best Thai in town I've been eating here since 1994 or so.
2447,Wow The food is beyond perfection They really seem to understand how to begin with the best ingredients and to properly match all parts of a meal to create a masterpiece I love the salmon super food entree but the menu does seem to change so be ready to be impressed by new delicious and healthy discoveries.
4145,Nasty company whose founders should be fined for harassment   Made dozens of automated calls to my new cell phone looking for a man I don't know yet when you press the number to indicate they have the wrong person the system hangs up on you and proceeds to call you every day anyway  When I finally did get in touch with a rep he wouldn't give me the full name of the company what business the company was in the purpose it was calling me or anyone I could contact to get this info  After that he hung up on me  Law states debt collection agencies must identify themselves and the purpose of their company when contacting (possible) debtors and anyone hiring this company should know they are entering a contract with someone who's standard operating procedures are against the law.
4887,What a shame Found this on yelp and thought that I would surprise my Colombian wife with some real Latin American foodFinally found the place behind the Taco Bell on Bell Rd and sat down to examine the menu Wow what a diverse selection and Bandeja PaisaIt took a while to get our drinks and to order our food Only 11 other people in the room so not busyAfter 90 minutes we gave up paid for our drinks and went home The 6 top next to us had been waiting almost 2 hours with only an empanada to show for it During our visit we saw 5 plates come out of the kitchen That's 1 plate every 20 minutesI've been around the restaurant/hotel business for 30 years and have never seen such a miserable situation Either scale the menu back to something manageable or give it up.
3708,closed 07-13-13.
2265,I love La Bocca's Bruschetta so much La Bocca is definitely one of my favorite places in Tempe to go Their sangrias are great I've had the white and the red and they both are very flavorful without being too much Most of all however I have to talk about the bruschetta because that's what I get every time I go I always get the same thing - one caprese one pesto tomato and two prosciutto goat cheese fig They are all fab but really I could probably get four prosciutto goat cheese fig ones because those are the best Absolutely delicious I've also had their limoncello which is pretty tasty I go to La Bocca all of the time and it's definitely my favorite spot on Mill Ave.
3001,Great value delicious food nice casual atmosphere  But best of all terrific service Our server was busy and someone else noticed and got us started with our order  Excellent team work and very well-managed  Keep up the great job.
3618,"Took my parents who are in from Ohio CR back there is good food & a good time However CR Tempe isn't It was Friday night but very slow so that should have been a red flag Five of us went for dinner Only one meal was rated OK the rest were horrible Burgers were dry & tasteless Chicken wings undercooked and virtually sauceless Waitress was slow & wasn't knowledgeable about menu questions The pretzel with dipping cheese appetizers were great but that wasn't enough to up the stars The manager did come to the table about undercooked wings but he had an arrogant attitude leaning into my moms face & saying ""so what's your problem with the wings"" While at the table he was also hugging the waitress while she was hanging on him Not at all professional Choose another place if you want good food & good service."
1875,II highly recommend this place very professional and family oriented.
4605,I dropped my jacket to get it dry-clean they returned it back exactly the same with the spilled juices on it and they still charged me $6 I'd never go back again and their manager is very disrespectful when she talked to me on the phone.
1227,This was my first time dining here and I'm impressed I'm a concierge which means I dine out a lot as part of my job so I'm a bit of a guest/customer service snob so I'm not easily impressed The location was great and easy to get to The atmosphere was nice Not too dark of lighting which is good I like to be able to read the menu and see what I'm eating/drinking I would have liked maybe a different color scheme and more Italian art but that played no impact on my review Timoteo was our server He was extremely knowledgeable kind friendly and quick without making us feel rushed That's important Too many servers/waiters these days come off as annoyed by questions wanting you to hurry up and tip them But not here We felt so welcomed and comfortablelike we were with family In the same respect the service was not intrusive either A perfect balance The food was delicious Homemade bread to start was wonderful Meat was perfectly cooked to order Kudos to the kitchen staff We loved how well Timoteo was able to make suggestions based on my indecisiveness I just told him what I was in the mood for and he said they could even combine the Filet and Penne with the Bolognese from a different dish When it came time for dessert he was fabulous once again with pairing our Tawny Porto with Tiramisu and Moscato with Lemon SorbetThank you Zoran for a wonderful restaurant and to Timoteo for a wonderful experience We will be back again.
3932,Staff in this place are very RUDE and make you feel rushed The food is NOT that great and they give you waay to much food on your plate.
3459,"My dad ordered a chile relleno and it came out with what looked like chicken inside what the I flagged down our sweet server Norma who said although she would never dare make her own chile relleno that way Aunt chilada's does  It seriously looked like canned chicken and I was shocked they would ruin a simple dish like that by adding chicken stuffed inside  My dish was just simple taquitos and the chicken was so dry it was near jerky  Salsa was average nothing about this place was ""mexican"" and the ducks all over the place kinda grossed me out  NEVER again will I spend my $ or allow anyone to spend theirs while in company  Aunt Chilada's you FAIL."
1513,Can't really give a review on the food because they were out of chicken Went there on a Monday night not very late and they had only 1 piece of white meat chicken left no chicken strips and a few of the spicy chicken pieces left (we didn't want spicy)The staff wasn't overly friendly Not rude just not real friendly.
3581,We are regulars of the Mesa location always enjoy it This visit on Central was really disappointing Party of four stopped last night the margaritas were great Both the red and green salsas were really salty all four commented on that I thought it may be the chips it was the salsa Usually out of town guests comment on the heat but the salt was the noticeable flavor Wife had a chicken burrito Bite one yielded a bone and lots of water Not to be confused with juice it was water My green chili dinner was mediocre The beef chunks were large and the chili had not flavored the meat The meat had been put on the plate green chili poured over the top The meat was dry nothing comparable to the green chili I have had at other locations Diner three loved the ribs Diner four ate the flautas but said they were bland Typically in Mesa people love the food and comment on the heat In this case one loved his ribs all loved the margaritas Maybe we hit on a bad night but most of the passion I have for their hot food was not fulfilled These salsas were overwhelming with salt all four of us commented immediately We are pretty easy to please have been eating at Ls Dos for years We will go back to Mesa but not this location There were too many negatives not much on the plus side.
3332,Snippy waitress Ran out of bruschetta and caprece salad Caesar salad was warm shredded lettuce (apparently including iceberg) and tomatoes with some sort of non garlic dressing that was barely able to be tasted That is not a Caesar salad  Flatbread came without being cut into manageable slices and crumbled all over the place Was told the bruschetta would have been made on facacio  bread  if they had any That is not bruschetta  My companions ordered shared salad and flatbread which arrived without sharing plates  The kitchen was slow and the wait staff insufferable The chef is obviously very high on himself  I was embarrassed to have taken my visiting relative there.
1551,I happened upon Aloha Kitchen on my last visit to Phoenix The food was authentic and perfect I grew up in Hawaii and was transported back to the islands and my childhood On my fortieth birthday it was the perfect evening The saimin char sui bao and the teriyaki chicken were great I wouldn't recommend the haupia pie as authentic which is a good thing for the locals When done exceptionally well it is addictive I will eat here during each and every visit to the area.
209,I went in scared of dental work after hiding from it for many years  The whole experience was surprisingly pleasant and not painful at all  Great nice gentle people  I had Dr Larson.
2141,The Renaissance Festival is a place where everyone and anyone can venture to in order to awaken their medieval passions and expose a side of them no other place can reveal  Here people can be themselves without fear of being judged  They can dress in clothing appropriate to the era eat as citizens of the renaissance age would eat and live a day in the shoes of people whose lifestyle consisted of these aspects every day of their lives all while having a merry timeWhat's fascinating about the Renaissance Festival is it is an escape from the everyday bustling industrial environment known to people of the 21st century  Once you pass through the gates you are immersed in a culture rarely seen these days  Men women and children of all ages absorb the spirit of the festival and change into someone only such a place can expose  Immediately you are compelled to have high spirits as people dancing shopping and just continuously enjoying themselves welcome you to the festival  From there the opportunities are limitless for there are twelve stages of continuous live entertainment jousting tournaments over 200 artisans displaying a variety of unique wares and displays of ancient skills like glassblowing leatherworking weaving woodcarving blacksmithing candlemaking and potteryOne specific entity of the Renaissance Festival that stands out in my mind is the old coin striking mill tucked away and blended into in the strips of stores surrounding it  Here a family of three (father mother and daughter) work to produce unique coins crafted into necklaces by means of a punch press  The store offers some 100 different punch dyes each a symbol possessing its own special meaning  The categories range from mythological symbols to astrological to even ancient Egyptian  Once their customer has chosen two of their own special symbols they want imprinted on a coin they place a blank either bronze or silver between each dye and clamp it to a press  Then a heavy weight is hoisted a few feet above the dyes and then suddenly dropped onto the head of one dye eternally imprinting the symbols on the coin  What's distinctive about this certain store is they can fulfill the needs of any customer that they are presented with by owning such a broad spectrum of dyes applicable to anyone due to the meaningful descriptions given to each symbol  Additionally what captivates people is the fact that the coin is formed before your very eyes three feet away making the production a very personal thing for the consumer  If you and your family are venturing to the Renaissance Festival in Arizona anytime soon which I would undoubtedly recommend be sure to stop in on this special experience not attained anywhere else close by.
4773,"I've ordered from this place before and I remember it being ""not bad"" definitely a lot cheaper than the place closer to the house  Ordered for delivery - Arrived right around the time-frame they gave me  Got the fried wontons sweet & sour chicken and the broccoli with pork  Fried wontons were dry/hard essentially flavourless and just tough to eat  Sweet and sour chicken (sauce on side) was basically a bucket of fried chicken chunks with the plain red sauce in a tub of its own  The chicken itself wasn't terrible but it wasn't particularly good either  Most places I've gotten this from serve it with pineapple and vegetable chunks in the sauce So this was just a bit bland and boring for me  The broccoli with pork was OK I can't complain really as I didn't have much of it  The thing that is actually making me write this review was the white rice that came with it I had a bit of it with the sweet and sour chicken no problem then when I went to dump a bit more out I noticed a big long black hair coming out with the rice  Nice  Well that was all for that meal  Oh I did have a fortune cookie as well it said ""photographic memory just don't have film""  Thanks   So I'd give it 2 stars for delivery time and value but the hair thing was pretty gross and nothing else was very good  Sorry 1 star."
1939,Four words: Tomato Garlic mushroom pizza Two more: Meat Lasagna  Been dining and ordering delivery from here since they opened Great delivery time and the food is always consistent I'm not a big fan of square cut pies so I always request it be sliced The toasted club tuna salad sandwich garlic cheese bread (OMG) and crinkle cut fries are also favorites Don't forget the made in-house ranch dressing that is the best ranch you can order out Pick up a bottle of red wine order the large meat lasagna to share with your sweetie and an order of garlic cheese bread - you will NOT be sorry Delish.
3571,"I had been planning on getting a complete car detail somewhere and was still reading reviews on where to go but needed a quick wash in the meantime so I stopped by Dannys The Dannys salesperson Jorge presented the complete detail package and although I explained I didn't have time to do it then the hard sale included ""we'll give you 3 free quick washes you can use 1 now and come back for the detail when you have time The price started high then kept rapidly dropping and including more features the more I declined Finally came down to the ""I give you good deal if you do it now includes complete interior and exterior wash engine clean and more things just kept getting circled on the paperwork"" Out of exhaustion sympathy for the people waiting in line behind me vacuum people waiting ahead of me and really needing the detail anyway I gave in signed the form gave them my credit card used my ""free"" quick wash and was on my way (average job on the wash then btw) Part 2- Finally scheduled and went in for my detail Upon arrival the ""greeter"" promptly looked in my window read the damn ""need oil change"" service reminder that's been glaring at me for a few hundred miles and suckered me in to that service too (whatever- convenience to me) I explained I was there for my detail They popped the hood Jorge (again) said I he had given me a good deal but didn't I want the engine cleaned too I tried to remind him he had included that in the deal but apparently since he hadn't circled it it wasn't really included Jorge says ""I can't give that for free you'd have to talk to the manager"" When I asked for the managers name he seemed surprised that I would actually do it so I did The manager ""Alex"" was actually quite nice gave me the engine detail apologized and said he told Jorge to not push the sale so hard in the future I was told 25- 3 hrs and I would get a call when it was done So 4 hrs later I call find out it's done Pay for the oil change hunt down my car and someone w/ the keys So-overall results looked all bright and shiny at first but they just gooped on extra armorall on my leather seats still had finger smudges on the interior of the sun roof white spots where the wax had not been rubbed off small scratches that I'm pretty sure would have come out anywhere else The kicker was on the inside of the windshield there were 2 spots where parking permits had left a residue (one with part of the paper liner still attached) and they didn't do ANYTHING to try to remove ANY of it I drove away again exhausted and vowing to write my first ever negative yelp review Sorry for the long review but I hope it helps someone save the time money and energy Good Luck."
580,Unhappy cold food Half the time there is unfriendly clerk charging different pricing Cheese did not even melt on rolled tacos and the guacamole is on the right side so you can't pick them up Apparently every one is left handed 2-3 years and still can't get their act together What a shame.
3480,This review is basically for AT & T in general - not this store however I want to make sure everyone realizes how they treat their clients I was a client for over 20 years I made the decision to change to Verizon and I called and was told that my contract expired on February 1st I canceled my account on February 2nd You all know that you pay your bill in advance so I was paid from 1-22 through 2-22 Paid my bill Thought I would get a credit for the unused 20 days Not so You get zero credit So here is a caution to everyone Your contract expiration date is one thing but you must pay through the entire cycle even if you are no longer a client Horrible customer service Horrible.
3175,Our visit was unremarkable for my son's stitches 6 days later after making an appt with our PCP to have the stitches removed it occurred to me that WVUC may remove them for free (I work in an ER and some of the Dr's will do this) I called and they said yes of COURSE they would remove them free of cost Sweet I cancelled the appt with his pediatrician and had them removed at WVUC We then later received a bill for $75 for the visit They of course deny that ANY of their staff would ever say the suture removal would be free of charge The office manager was very unhelpful I get so sick of this dishonesty in business stick to what you say Simple And it sounds like I'm not the only one There is an urgent care on every corner in Surprise - use your money elsewhere.
3273,Damn it feels good to be a gangsta I heard that song last time I walked in The guy that made my sandwich kept rubbing snot off his nose and didn't wash his hands He asked me if I wanted the wiz or if I was a skirt Can you call a girl a skirt I went with the wiz wanting to appear like a educated philly girl  It was gross really gross The meat tasted freezer burned and so did the fries Slathering the crap in cheese wiz only made it more apparent that I was going to have a heart attack before finishing it Don't eat here you'll be sorry Your stomach will drop kick you over and over Cheese Wiz is gross They have other things on the menu like greasy grease sloshed around in cheese or for a healthier version you can add grease soaked mushrooms and peppers to your cheese soaked brittle bun Warning - Only skirts do that When you go to Corleones you wanna be a gangsta Ok maybe not but I did want to cap the bitch that frightened me into ordering the wiz.
758,if you have a few extra pounds you are wanting to loose the owner will look at you in disgust she presented this place as one for those who are extremely physical fit  not to over share but i have a medical condition which will never allow me to look like work out barbie i wanted to try something new and she showed me the door i lost the money i put into and felt completely humiliated so if you are not in tip top shape she may pull up the faq's and show  you to the door.
4728,never in my life have i been so happy to dine and dash before i won't give a time it happened nor will i ever return so i honestly don't fear retributionbut after waiting 30 minutes between drinks and then never saw the waitress again i was so fed up with this place i just walked the fuck out if they don't care enough about the customers to at least make their rounds every 5-10 minutes to see if we are happy then they certainly don't care about my money which by the way i would have been happy to give them the drinks were good but i was sober before the next one arrived unless they are freezing the ice cubes to order there is no reason for a delay I'm not going to cause a fuss and complain to the manager I'm sure the wait on a manager would have been just as bad as the service so kick rocks I'm outfrom my experience i really don't think this establishment deserves more then 1 star i would give 0 if it was possible.
3678,The store can be bigger but they have great customer service My boyfriend and I were kicked out last july for something that we still don't know what we did we made a complaint to the HR in texas they were doing an investigation and we havent heard from them back at all i was wondering does anyone know who the store manager at the tempe location is now I believed it was eric but i wouldnt be shocked if he got fired for that cuz he approached us off of whole foods property claiming we did something to his store.
460,WOW oh WOW  talk about sevice and a view So speacle occasion this is the place to go  It's like everyone in the resturant knew us specipicly  The Food was great a little pricey but I did enjoy it all oh my the lava cke at the end was a great finish for two.
3840,Where are you people eating pizza and claiming this is the best you have tasted Its bland with a tough crust The sauce has no resemblance to an italian pizza taste There wasnt 1 drop of oil anywhere to be found Rosatis and Casanovas kill this pizza and they are not exceptional Also a brick oven can only do so much A traditional pizza oven is the way to go In a nutshell this is over priced crappy pizza.
1903,Costco Tire Department leaves much to be desiredMy wife's car needed new tires  We like shopping in Avondale and headed over to Costco  The guy who sold the tires was nice enough and seemed knowledgeable about tires Installation was completed quicklyThat's the good news The problem we had was that we received an ad later than day about the same tires being available for about $25 cheaper  Went back to the store expecting the great service you hear about from Costco  I didn't find it  And I really triedThe store staff relayed that Costco does not price match  They then offered take our new tires as a return with a refund minus the installation and disposal fee  Asking why they would keep the disposal fee they said they wouldn't be able to find our original tires to put back on  I questioned how I would be able to drive away if they didn't give our tires back one technician said he didn't knowNot believing these to be intelligent answers I spoke with a manager  After talking it through she shared that didn't make sense but was all they could offer  I'm still not sure if that was supposed to make me feel better or worse  I emailed Costco customer services online and got no response after a weekBottom line: Not the best prices Don't stand behind their prices Offers a frustrating customer service experience Has service staff who are nice but unable/unwilling to do much.
498,First time ordering from Pizza Heaven I picked this place because of the yelp reviews Perhaps their regular crust pizza is great but this was by far the worst gluten-free pizza I've ever had(no exaggeration) The crust was tasteless and soggy like wet cardboard I popped it into the oven to see if I could get e crust crispy but no luck I'm so disappointed.
1760,Sushi: 4/5 stars It's always tasted fresh but a lot of rolls are deep fried I especially like the Phoenix Roll Rock n Roll and Volcano RollService: 5/5 I have no complaints Every time I've gone with my bf we've never experienced a long wait for a drink refill or ordering off the menu Everyone has been pleasant They have the Belly card and last time I was there our server offered to take it to the register and swipe it for mePrice: 5/5 It's already very reasonable at $150-$4 for a (half) roll and up to $5 for sashimi or uni sushi but they also have happy hour where it's 50 cents off a plate I found coupons in the Clipper (from the mailbox) as well as onlineAtmosphere: 4/5 It's a mix between a sushi bar and almost a buffet but the conveyor belt is unique and a fun change of pace I wish you could leave 45 I'll give it the 5 because for what it is I can't see room for improvement There are plenty of other places that are delicious but drain my wallet I come here 1-2 times a month happy to add it to my rotation.
4769,It's very sad to see  company turn to bad business after the loss of an owner but this one did  I'm very unhappy with the way this company has treated me over a rent a charge  Scottsdale Collision is not paying thier bill's so be very careful when doing business with the company  I was just hit with a charge from Hertz along with a number of other people  This company put me in a rent a car saying the charge was covered by them as my car was being repaired and I was charged for the rent a car one year later  After months of phone call's to Scottsdale Auto Collision I got the run around  I'm now stuck paying this charge because of poor management after the owner was killed or in Jail  The story keeps changing from the company  So Don't hand over your CC unless you want to pay  I was charged one year following my service  What a nightmare this has been~.
1660,"My Aunt and Uncle were in town and I was tasked by my Mom to find a great place to eat My Uncle always picks up the check so the price had to be modest but the service and food had to be excellent and at the last minute Mom threw in ""oh and we want to eat outside"" I looked for quite a while at reviews of places I narrowed my search to the $$ places and Tommy V's stood out as one of the top ones in Scottsdale I searched for outdoor seating and again of that list Tommy V's stood out I didn't see any pictures of outdoor seating on Yelp (hint hint Mr cool owner guy who I know is reading this) so I called to make sure they did have the outdoor seating and made a reservations for the 6 of us My first impression was a great one I would describe the decor as clean and classy No clutter just a perfectly lit perfectly decorated modern spot with the music to go with it I don't remember what everyone got but two of us got that Lobster Bisque which was super fantastic and two of us got the ""Manila Clams Linguine"" which is by far the best seafood pasta dish that I have ever had loaded with clams A few of us got the ""Grilled Shrimp Risotto"" and they made my mom something that wasn't on the menu at her requestThe service was excellent and our server did a great job suggesting the right wine for each person on the group Well other than me because I am more of whiskey kind of guy We all had a fantastic time everything we ordered was excellent and the added touch of the owner coming out to see how everything was makes this place an easy 5 stars and a place I would without reservation recommend to anyone Oh the other thing I noticed when I was doing my research was the consistency of positive customer experiences A lot of top reviewed places in Scottsdale seem to be hot or cold depending on your server or the night you go Tommy V's seems to have a formula for getting it right all the time."
3628,Looking through the photos that were uploaded for this particular Crapmart you can't help but notice that some woman uploaded a photo of herself wearing gaudy brightly colored make-up that looked like it'd been applied with a trowel  And looking at her Yelp account you'll notice that she doesn't actually write reviews she just uploads photos of herself in various ghetto poses to random businesses  Have you ever noticed that on the side of all photographs Yelp always asks if the photo is:Very HelpfulHelpfulNot HelpfulYeah I looked at this photograph and it suddenly occured to me that it was actually VERY helpful in describing this particular WalMart  In fact it should probably be THE storefront photoSo I clicked VERY helpful and that's when I noticed that at least 2 other people also thought the same thing and had voted that photograph very helpful  There you go folks  That photo says it all.
1864,Such nice people -- all whom I met  Carrie especially  Good selection of healthy plants OK parking convenient to SR51   A nice experience -- especially after the cold shoulder that Willfill manages to show time and again.
4071,"This restaurant completely mislead us  The sign outside said ""Organic Menu"" but we were a little concerned when we saw the lit Bud Light signs  This is apparently an organic restaurant AND a pub which seems like an odd combo  We went in and after looking at the menu we wondered where the organic food was  There was only one thing we were able to see and it was on the kids menu  We ordered and the food wasn't bad but quite expensive  My salad however was supposed to be mixed seasonal greens with heirloom tomatoes  It was Romaine lettuce with some flavorless tomatoes which was pretty disappointing  The only saving grace was the sweet potato fries and the white bean avocado spread    Overall if this restaurant didn't say it was organic and wasn't so expensive it might have received more stars."
1369,Drove 5 hours with family after seeing on tripple DDD Food was fantastic I don't like Alfredo sauces but their chicken Alfredo was unbelievably fantastic as well as their subs and marinera sauce My family and I will be back This is highly recommended.
1991,I d like to start off by saying that this used to be a great Hallmark for mailing packages until they hired this gentleman named Mike who runs the back mailing office I hardly ever write bad reviews on a place unless I feel there was a major problem that needed addressing in this case I have to say that Mike is probably the rudest individual I have ever come acrossI needed to mail off a package that was oddly shaped He overcharged me by almost $80 I thought this was way overpriced so I went home and hopped onto the USPS website plugged in all the dimensions weight height length etc right from the receipt Mike had given me It came out to a mere $39 and change That's a huge difference to I went back immediately and I asked to speak to his supervisor and he told me she didn' t  like to be bothered she wasn't there she's never there So was he basically telling me he could just do what he wanted back there I'm sorry but this person running the mail counter does not know anything blamed the computer and is more than likely overcharging customers on a regular basis I wanted to discuss it with him in a calm manner and he started getting very huffy with me and then told me to leave or he would call security I went to a different Hallmark store about 65 miles away that handled USPS mail and they charged me exactly what the website showed the first timeVery disappointed in this Hallmark and will not be returning I will also have to tell everyone I know not to go here either In fact my step-mother had an equally unpleasant run-in with this same clerk about a week laterIf you don't like customers Mike then I would recommend a job where you are not required to interact with them.
3700,This is the original Macayo's and man has it seen better days The decor is old The carpeting is tired The plates are chipped and scratched up The service is crap and the food is NOT what it is at other Macayo's around town It took our server 10 minutes to come and get our drink order One member of our party ordered a Coke and it was totally flat It took her another 10 minutes to replace it  I had a chicken taco and the chicken tasted canned The server spilled salsa all over the table and took forever to come back to clean it up One member of our party ordered a bean and cheese burrito enchilada style and got a beef and green chili burrito with verde sauceand then our server seemed befuddled when we asked for her to replace it with what we actually orderedHonestly I have eaten in better dive-Mexican places than this Macayos Definitely skip this spot.
3271,"I want to start by saying I've spent THOUSANDS at Lowes in the past 8 months of living in my new home my average Lowes shopping trip is between $300-$800 dollars Tonight I showed up at Lowes literally at 7:59 a minute before closing I asked an employee who was in the parking lot (wish I got his name he was a great guy bald w/ a goatee) what time they were closing tonight and he told me 8:00pm and I replied that I didn't want to be ""the guy that rushes in last minute and that I would be back tomorrow"" He was super nice and assured me it wasn't a problem at all that I came all this way I should do my shopping and make the trip worth while I thanked him and walked toward the entrance A female employee walked out of the entrance to throw something in the trash can that was just outside the entrance but saw me walking up and very quickly scurried back in side and forced the doors shut with her hands and locked it quickly LITERALLY AS I WAS ABOUT TO ENTER through the doors She didn't say a word just looked at me in the face as she locked the door and walked away as I could hear her loudly asking another employee ""Is that against policy"" I was so shocked that she didn't even care enough to at least tell me sorry we are closing or we are closed sir or ANYTHING at all for that matter and that she just slammed the doors shut and locked them as if I was a stray dog or something The gentleman employee that was in the parking lot saw what happened and was EXTREMELY caring he opened the doors for me and let me do my shopping which took me 6 mins as there were still customers in the store I rated this Lowes the lowest rating possible so everyone can read this review but that employee who cared enough to let me do my unintentional ""last minute"" shopping is the ONLY REASON that I will continue to shop at Lowes and not spend the thousands of dollars a year at Home Depot if that guy didn't go out of his way to let me in the store this heartless woman would've cost Lowes a loyal frequent customer and a good amount of lost revenue I will try to find the guys name and update my review Thanks."
3792,I had high hopes but stay away I've been here twice hoping my first try was a bad night for them As others have said the staff is not experienced not friendly and almost pissy that they are working We walked in and the bar tender just stared at me and my hub A patron had to tell us to find our own seat THENthere was a shard of glass in my margarita The manager handled it poorly Blamed dishwasherThe patio and decor are nice but staff ruin it Had to ask for every little thingnapkinstraw silverware etc seriously needs improvement bf ill spend money there again.
3642,I didn't think this place lived up to what it's known for BURGERSIt was suppose to be this great place to have burgers we get there to find only three burgers on the menu kind of a let down And they weren't anything special Not to mention it was very dark inside The only cool thing about it was that the fries came in this tiny grocery cart shaped baskets.
2010,It was real treat finding a local restaurant with so much history and tradition The Stockyard is a landmark and I'm so glad I dined hereOur waiter was really informative since he's a native of Phoenix and knew the history behind this establishment Check out the the beautiful hand carved Mahogany bar in the saloon It's pretty amazing that this sits on what use to be the largest cattle auction stockyard in North America This stockyard would pass 40000 cattle through here per daily during cattle auctions  Enough history on with the foodI made reservations for 7:00 pm and we were seated at a plush leather booth I really enjoyed the decor here from the stain glass to the large ceiling lamps which contained hanging branding irons We were greeted with a relish dish baking soda biscuits and corn poblano muffins The raw veggies were fresh served with ranch dressing and the biscuits and muffins were warm and incredibly delishFor my main entree I chose the 12 oz prime rib which actually seemed larger and was a thick cut The entree included soup or salad and a side which is a rarity now a days with all the absurd priced Ala ca rte steak houses The house salad was solid and the blue cheese dressing delicious My prime rib was cooked to perfection - medium rare with hot Au Jus and the potato gratin was also delishCurrently The Stockyard was offering the centennial dinner which was a bargain at $4000 it included a incredible tasting pear salad campfire sirloin steak with whiskey peppercorn sauce grits cowboy chili made with Chorizo and roasted corn The dinner included dessert and we went with the warm pecan pie with bourbon flavored whip cream - OMG it was the BOMBOverall a great dinning experience with excellent service and quality I would definitely return here again.
572,Can I live here please I've loved FLW since I was in like 5th grade or something and went on a school field trip and thought that wherever we were (some FLW building in Phoenix I rack my brain trying to remember) was the coolest thing I'd ever seen  I've been to Taliesin West quite a few times kinda want to go again  I think I want to live there.
4036,Damn I thought after all the hoopla this place was supposed to have the BEST chicken fried steaks in PhoenixIT DOESN Tnow I m from Texas and in all my 62 years  i have not had a more greasysoggylimp chicken fried steakYUCKwhat a load of crap this thing was The rest of the place was a  dumpthe bathroom had to be shared with employee changing his clothessmall is the wordI would bet you if Gordon Ramsey or the health dept inspected this dump the kitchen would be closed first thingsave your money and time go back to Texas every now and then go to the Market Diner on Harry Hines in Dallas and eat a REAL GOOD chicken fried  steak with fresh cream gravy and not that congealed goo from the texaz GRILLI have had better from roadside vendors but nothing worse than the imitation chicken fried steak this place serves insteadlazy @
2145,I'd have to say that I'm pretty disappointed in this one After reading the great reviews I thought this would be a great place to drop by this afternoon after school I called and found that the price for a gel manicure was very cheap and with that and the great reviews I was in The technician was very nice but that's probably the only other good thing that I will say about this place First off it was dirty not the station where my nails were done but around it The molding on the walls and dry wall had holes in it It looked very run down Also the selection of gel polish colors was dismal Very dismal They did not have the color that I was looking for (which I understand is a standard OPI color carried everywhere) so I opted for clear She cleaned up my cuticles alright but left quite a little bit to be clipped off But here comes my REAL issue Filing The filing job on my nails was so incredibly sloppy It left them jagged uneven rough and dirty I did not notice this at first because I was just relaxing and the place itself was very dark She applied the polish and I left Looking at my nails after the polish was also uneven and painted off of my nail and onto my finger I actually had to stop by Walgreens and get a nail file and FIX my freshly done nails I guess you really get what you pay for which is a real shame Next time I will stick with my usual place and pay a little more so that I know it will be done right the first time.
4940,I don't know why everyone gives the store in Tempe a good review I just went today to make a simple purchase of a table and chair for my grandson and it was a nightmare I have never liked the layout of IKEA finding it confusing and illogical Sure enough I was trying to find the children's section No signs and no sign of anyone work working on the floor I wander around and finally find it pick out what I want and get a shopping cart That's where I hit my first major snag The cart doesn't wheel right It goes all over the place I decide to ditch it and get one in self service figuring they have to have them there also Of course they don't because that would be logical I happen upon one that was left there and guess what That one also doesn't wheel right Like the other one it wheels all over the place I can barely control it I press on tho to get my items and can't find one of them but there are workers there so I ask one about the missing item He has to call someone in that dept Really You can't just help me find the right bin While I'm waiting I find the item myself and struggle to get the cart to one of only two cashiers working To get the sale price of my items I find out I have to belong to the IKEA family At this point I don't want to belong to this moronic family but I want my discount I'm told I have to join at the kiosk Its pointed out to me by a worker running from me Nice I can't get the kiosk to work No help around now Another customer asks the cashier who gives us forms to fill  out to get the card Apparently after you go to the kiosk you have to fill out this paperwork for the card anyway Huh And why didn't the cashier tell me that in the first place I'm now beginning to suspect the workers are sadists who like to see us sufferI purchase my items but now I have to figure out how to get my uncontrollable cart out of the store and to my car I find that heaving the cart away from me gets it to move the most feet I crash it into a wine rack I don't care there are no workers around anyway I heave it some more and manage to get it out the door to my car It took me an hour and a half to purchase a simple table and chair I don't plan on visiting my new 'family' ever again.
2137,YUMMMMM The atmosphere is so comfortable I especially love the patio area where we like to enjoy a glass of wine and a couple of appetizers The food is excellent especially the pizza and I think its hard to find good pizza This is a great place for date night or to bring the whole familywe do both :)Great food at an excellent value with wonderful service What more could you possibly want.
415,Love this place  The food is spot on and the service is always perfect  I normally get the combo which has a beef enchilada beef tamale and a beef taco I have three words to describe it: FAB-U-LOUS The margaritas aren't bad either Oh Yeah The chips and salsa are awesome.
2522,Great prices and a variety of ethnic foods.
2578,Thank goodness they opened a location near me I could probably eat the same dish there for the rest of my life or I guess I could try other dishes too But if it ain't broke why fix it.
2079,I have a love/hate relationship with this place I love that they have everything you could ever want for cooking or baking but hate that my wife wants to spend hours there asking my opinion on different types of rolling pins and cupcake decorationsThis place really is a one-stop shop for cooks and aspiring chefsRobert Pfeifer.
1298,The best bar in the valley to see live music  The food is good the drinks are reasonable and the bands ROCK.
3293,Scale of 1-10 (single visit):7 Food6 *Drinks*3 Service7 Atmosphere7 ValueThe other Doses I've been to have been fine (though still nothing special) and I assume this was just an off night for these guys but I have to rate them according to my direct experience  Maybe I'll get to give them another try so I can change it but we'll see.
4373,Word to the wise order your burger well done here You and your toilet will be thankful PS Employees handling food should always wash their handsThat's all I am going to say.
1346,Zumba on Friday night with Bethany is the BEST.
4384,No more $1 beers and lowered crown credits Don't bother going to this shit hole It has gone way downhill in the last few months Machines are outdated and now my favorite quarter machines that actually have a bonus feature were changed to a penny denomination Won't be back Poor return for what your bet is Virtually impossible to even win a little to keep playing Take your business to Casino Arizona.
2983,This is my new go to brunch spotTom the bartender (whos super cute) hooks it up Let him have his way with you(r drinks) and he won't steer you wrong First beverage he brought me was a blackberry champagne mojito super light and refreshing The second was also a champagne cocktail of sorts I believe it had some sort of peach puree in it It was absolutely delightful  The coolest thing about it was it had a sphere of ice in it that looked like a crystal ball Magical As for the food it also didn't disappoint Tom suggested we start with cheese stuffed jalapenos not fried Oohy gooey and oh so tasty My entree was the huevous rancheros pretty straight forward but lighter and crispier than I've had before served with roasted root veggies Surely palate pleasing.
1701,"Small simple and accommodating menu  Excellent service ambiance and portions = phenomenal value  I highly recommend the house cheeseburger with ""fondue"" style cheese sauce and side of fries Perfect date nite with the BF  We'll be back again soon."
1809,Wonderful and warm people excellent service great trip this is the team to go diving with You are always taken care of with Scuba Specialties.

2655,Best Mexican restaurant in the valley definitely the priciest too but if your willing to spend then it's the place to go.
661,"This place is a total disaster I ended up moving to a new apartment on Easter so I took my friends to Mill Ave for some eats and drinks after we finished moving Saw Blondies with their ""2-for-1 IPA"" sign on the sidewalk and stupidly decided to try itWe walked in and were not greeted until we're halfway inside the big restaurant Pretty blonde in cheerleader costume finally told us to sit anywhere We asked about the patio but were told there's not enough room for six there We pushed two tables together and sat down inside The cheerleader was nice enough to tell us that she'd put on any game we wanted on the big TVsAfter five minutes the cheerleader came back and took our drink orders - three beers and three sodas We waited ten minutes for the beers to arrive and they're in cheesy little plastic cups in contrast to the pint glasses I can see guys drinking from at the bar Whatever Ten more minutes go by until the sodas arrived The cheerleader never bothered to ask us after twenty minutes if we'd actually like to order some foodWe asked for a manager but there was none on duty Granted it was Easter but if you're going to be open shouldn't there be some kind of management Anyway we told the bartender at the patio our problems She comped us the sodas and one of the beers We paid for the two IPAs and went across the intersection to Gordon Biersch where we received superior service and drank better beerBlondies Never ever again."
2804,Sadly this Walmart is closest to my house but it is a complete and utter crapholeThe employees are always very nice but the parking lot is a battleground swarming with migrant workers scattered trash and random bums coming up to you asking for money the carts are a joke and I challenge you to find one that has even 3 non-wonky wheels the store is a friggen mess and checking out  Oh dear sweet Jesus I hope you have an hour to kill because that's how long it'll take you  I've never seen more than 4 lines open at once no matter how long the lines were  PatheticAnd no matter what do not I repeat DO NOT attempt to shop here on the 1st or the 15th of the month  Just gonna have to trust me on that one.
3167,"I would never step foot in the place again - I would rather sleep in my car  We picked the Pima Inn to stay as we were down for AZ bike week  First of all they should have told us they were right across the street from Spring Training that there was construction going on and traffic was going to be horrible  They made us wait until exactly 3 PM to check in even though our room was readythe free Internet did not work as the signal was so weak you could not log on they promised a MC wash which never materialized they said they parking for MC's which was some yellow tape and traffic cones they took from the street - and placed it in the middle of the street  I had to run of the brat wanna be base ball players who were sitting in the hall in front of my room door  Then I had to listen to the dog bar all night in the sections labeled ""NO PETS""I could go on and on and onhorribly managed worst resort hotel experience I have ever had."
3712,This store is awful The lines are consistently super long (seriously at a circle k) and the employees are lazy and rude At times lines are so long they wrap around the inside of the store Usually only one cashier will be working and the other employees hiding Not to mention the fact that the place is not kept clean and it's a newer store The employees absolutely do not care Is there a manager running this place The manager should be firedOn a side note there is one employee Jessica who is always really nice.
3203,This place was shut down by the health department today  Drink there if you can but they ran out of beer this weekend  And I peeked in back to find them pouring $10 vodka into the Grey Goose bottles  Kins of a blatant violation of anything ethical but what do you expect from a hangoverHopefully the cool crew like Doug Snyder Alicia and Linda do better in Old TownVisit if you dare but I visited years ago and it was much better  Word is out that they did not pay anyone who works there and they are selling the placeShame cool spot hopefully someone buys it and brings it back.
2046,"I've been to a number of car washes in this town and Lindstrom's is the finest As a self-professed neat freak and perfectionist I can assure you that your car will be well-groomed at Lindstrom'sThey are not in the habit of upselling and pressure tactics - just pressure washing They are friendly willing to accommodate my needs and clean without frills I have been coming to their car wash for some years and continually come back (even when I stray wash my own car or pick one of those gas station car washes on the fly) Lindstrom's seems a little sad these days and emptied Not sure if it has to do with the recession the brutally hot Phoenix summer or the recent raid on their service staff by the Sheriff's office for ""identity theft"" But whatever the case Lindstrom's provides a superior service and is a local business and for those two reasons alone please frequent this establishment Your car will thank you."
3799,In my experience I found her not to have the level of knowledge and expertise expected  Suspect either poor listening or poor comprehension skills as she researches and answers questions not asked while failing to respond to those actually asked then charges both meeting time and research timeInitially found her to be basically competent in elementary tax matters (ie turbo tax or other software might do just as well) but would suggest seeking expertise elsewhere if your situation has any degree of complexity or variance to vanilla 1040.
4566,Am glad my hubby liked his sushi as I had one of the WORST restaurant experiences ever hereOur waitress was not exactly a firecracker spoke very softly in a room full of loud bikers and didn't seem in any hurry to help usI am not a fish fan but dearly love shellfish so the grilled shrimp risotto sounded quite nice Hubby's sushi arrived and he started in on it and was making nummy noises When my plate of shrimp and risotto was tossed (literally) in front of me I was expecting to be doing the same Put a shrimp in my mouth and it was stone cold in the middle Thought maybe this was a fluke so went for 
1548,Absolutely fantastic Our small business conference group were treated like kings Food was perfect From appetizers to Desserts I wish all Flemings were this great :).
3925,I once loved to shop here but not any more rude and dirty stores.
2657,I was really looking forward to a great smoothie for lunch At first they said it was too watery and said they were going to remake it As I watched they poured it back in the mixer for a quick remix and then poured it into a cup It was still watery and was probably the worst smoothie I have ever hadSo disappointed.
4134,"I had never been to this store's location in Scottsdale before Saturday I have frequented the Biltmore location (and I'm a HUGE fan of their store & clothes) However I will NEVER go back to the Bogota location because of the service/staff The only people in the store who were getting good service or help were the snotty sales girl's friends Not only were they unhelpful but the sales girl actually insulted me to my face (""YOU're a size 2"" - YES actually I am)I walked out and went to the Biltmore location to spend several hundred dollars I am a big supporter of luluemon's products and storebut avoid the Bogota location if you want any service or a good selection."
3507,"One star is too many for this place We just went for the first time tonight Our waitress was slow and lazy We waited 15minutes before the server ""noticed"" us (she was busy talking to coworkers) We ordered some sushi and spring rolls The sushi is cheap and skimpy spring rolls were bland We ate less than 1/2 the sushi and sat waiting for our server to check on us (still busy talking to coworkers) With no more to drink and sitting waiting to get help for 1/2 hour the server finally noticed us glaring at her and came over to see if we wanted anything else We said ""no"" because nothing was good She left saying nothing and after 10 minutes just dropped our check at the table We were comped a good portion of the bill but no manager came to see us and the waitress never mentioned it Really all they needed to do is not ignore us and if they would have checked in shortly after we were served we could have tried something else and maybe saved the meal We will not be back In summation the food was poor quality the service was awful management is mia No idea how this place stays open."
4904,I have eaten at this location for free the last 8 times I've been there or ordered from themI think I'm finally done They can't get an order right to save their livesThey try I'll give em that They've re-fired my order three times to get it right more than once and they've not charges me for to go orders just to get them wrong anyway more than once TerribleIf you're looking for a place to eat that doesn't take three hours and three re-fires to get you your food you're better off staying home and ordering Jimmy Johns.
4899,This course has gone down hill drastically  They are under new management but the course is not maintained at all or at least very little  If your looking to get out and just practice then it is fine  The fairways are turning to dirt and the greens are really bad  I play there because it is close but as in another review you get what you pay for  The prices for the course are too high  I don't know what happened from last year but I am looking to golf somewhere else.
3643,Stay as far away from this place as possibleI went here against my will I am surprised that I am still alive Family members suggested eating here  after going to the mall Big HUGE mistake I am not sure what was worsethe food or the employees Both looked grossed as hell I stuck to foods that temperature was not an issuelike pizza and bread This place was filthyeverywhere and the food was nasty looking.
1167,"I almost don't want to tell you guys about this place Such is my greed to have a seat when I go back Think ""Jiro Dreams of Sushi"" as far as the smallness and inconspicuousness of the place (in a strip mall) But just like in ""Jiro"" (who's place is tucked away in the Tokyo subway) this place delivers big on sushi satisfaction Prices are very solid for what you get We were going to get some straight sashimi but the bento boxes looked so good and were such an amazing value we went that way Salmon teriyaki 6-piece sashimi rice soup and salad The sashimi came out first SEPARATE from the bento box It was not an after-thought it was in a bowl on it's own bed of ice and was amazing and fresh The chef also sent over a complimentary creamy cucumber and crab salad with sesame seeds that was out of this world The service was so friendly that it felt like we'd been there before To top it all off they also gave us a complimentary mochi and whip cream dessert at the end of the meal that took me to sushi/japanese cuisine nirvana It's hard to squeeze 5 stars out of me but this place did I can imagine doing a ""Groundhog Day"" (remember Bill Murray in that) where I came back to this place every day at the same time forever and that would be just fine Save me a seat I'm coming back."
2576,Bandera's Chicken Enchiladas have set the standard for me  I doubt I will ever find a better mexican dish anywhere  The mix of Green and Red enchilada sauce is Bombcom/thebestieverhad.
3447,"The first time we went to the fair *cough* glorified carnival *cough* was three years ago  I felt like I was in the Twilight Zone  We went for one of the free concerts but left early due to the amount of marijuana smoke in the section of the coliseum we were in me being pregnant at the time  We swore off the state fair and had not returned  Sadly we promised our toddler a ride on the ferris wheel when the state fair came this year  We figured we'd go fairly early and leave before dark Some of the workers look like they are on a prison work-release programwe won't even discuss the general crowd that attends   The food to us was subpar: ""Super"" nachos for $7 that consisted of the kind of chips you can buy in the store covered with cheese and hamburger meat everything else including sour cream peppers tomatoes etc were at least a buck extra All of the restrooms we used had no soap at all  Interestingly we went on opening day and the blocks and mats in Toddler Town were filthy  The fair had only been open for 4 hrs so I know the dirt was not from just that little time  Lame animal exhibits a ""farm tour"" that has just a few animals but dozens of rabbits for sale  More profanity from the mouths of kids (some who looked all of 10 years old) everywhere we walked than I hear in a month  On the way out a herd of tweens-teens ran through the crowd chasing after some other kids while screaming profanities  We definitely will NOT be back  We found a fair this summer in CA that was just awesome: clean safe and the best ""fair-type"" food we have ever had    We'll plan to go there next summer  I'm sad that this fair is supposed to represent the state of Arizona."
1520,My car was running rough leaking fluid and spewing smoke from the exhaust  I thought this would be major however they found the problem corrected it and the charge was minimal  I was astounded  Very honest  Will recommend to others.
4096,If I have to give it a star it is only because of their busty waitresses This is a miserable place serving miserable food with miserably loud music blaring at all hours of the dayIf you can imagine it's a restaurant in Scottsdale trying to reproduce the worst aspects of places like Cancun Got it.
148,"I've lived in these apartments since mid to late 2010 and will be moving soon into a house which I am very excited about Trillium could be a much better place to live but it is not When I first toured the complex it was a Saturday afternoon - the college kids were either drunken from their hangovers or working on picking up the next skank at the local bars If you REALLY want to see this place in its true color then you need to tour it at night after hoursThe proximity is close to ASU The idiots are loud and obnoxious The walls and windows are just not insulated enough to keep out their yelling loud cars and motorcycles The only salvation is if you live on the 3rd floor and get lucky enough to have quiet individuals next to you and below youParking needs its own paragraph You will not be able to find a place to park if you own more than one car You will be assigned one parking place I've had college kids try to park in my parking place also Forget finding another place to park though They invite all 50 of their friends over for the weekend Parking is simply out of the question here So if you take the bus or don't own a car this is the perfect place for youThe grounds are reasonably maintained Lately they've been doing less with the landscape and there's dog ---- just about everywhere you walk Lighting is ok - could be better as it seems very dim when walking through the corridor to your apartment at nightThe apartments themselves are fairly spacious but beware the cheapness Cheap fixtures everywhere Plastic countertops pressed wood cabinets poor insulation stained carpets and shoddy pipingThe maintenance people are nice but they do not know what they are doing If it's easy they can fix it with no problem If it's more complicated it requires several visits My washer didn't drain the water during the drain cycle for nearly three months I told them the washer needed to be replaced They danced around the issue during this time until I wrote a very demanding letter that was extremely firm All the while I was spending more in utility costs because my clothes had to be dried for hoursThe staff have absolutely no clue what they are doing I always place rent checks two of them in an envelope with the statement and then seal it and deliver it personally to the person at the front desk They lost one check but not the other I took the issue all the way up to the corporate office when they threatened to terminate my lease and made it seem like we had been the ones at fault for their mishandling of checks Their corporate office explained there were several people handling the checks during the long journey back to the corporate office to be cashed It IS NOT the tenant's fault if checks are lost or stolen by the office personnel**An update to the above paragraph - after fighting with the office about the check and writing them another check (never do this especially if you have a carbon copy) they agreed to at least pay the stop payment on the check -$35 The corporate office explained this would be an ""instant"" credit So I went in during my next month's rent payment and the front office said it would be on my next bil Not very instant but I waited patiently for the next month The next month came and still no credit I finally had to call the corporate office again and complain Not one thing was done to compensate me for wasting my time and causing problems The office crew and the business team at Trillium are absolutely INCOMPETENT Lease agreements are the worst They will charge you $1660 to terminate your lease instantly PLUS the incentives you have received For example they ""say"" the apartment I live in is really $1155 a month but they are giving me a ""discount"" and I only pay $932 a month If you terminate you must pay the $1660 fee plus the difference of the discounted rate and the regular rate for all of the time you've been there That's some pretty shady business practicesYou would be a great fit for this place if you are under the age of 25 act immaturely like to get loud and drunk don't have a car or take the bus don't mind the noise don't care about cheap crap in your apartment enjoy the hassle of the maintenance crews and incompetent office personnel and just really generally don't careMy advice: DO NOT waste your money here These apartments are already expensive and you certainly do not get what you pay for."
4749,What a joke If anyone ever asks me to attend this club again I will kindly show you a sarcastic smile while giving you the middle finger and walk away This place is like a crammed hallway ALL DUDES It seriously is a waste of time You literally have to push yourself through a wall of people that are shoulder to shoulder to get anywhere I am not even sure if the Fire Marshall would be pleased with the occupancy of the place This place smells like Body Oder and Vomit Both make sense giving the fact I seem someone blow chunks in a packed crowd That was really the only entertainment I saw at this place.
4305,"BANG BANG BANG on our door at 4 am by the front desk clerk  Why Ok let's start at the beginning  Phoenix has an overabundance of budget adequate chain motel/hotel rooms and we figured this was one of them  When we arrived the day before Thanksgiving 2011 we found a full-on construction site so much so that we could NOT find the way INTO the hotel  Eventually a workman snaked our way though to an incomplete lobby and we went up to our room  AT FIRST LOOK this newly redecorated room looked and smelled clean and even had a somewhat upscale interior design for a budget motel (This Ramada is becoming a Holiday Inn we were told)  But it was downhill after that  The water was turned off and we did not have water until three hours after we arrived  We turned on the air conditioner because it was in the 80's and the window does not open WELL we might as well have been in an airplane test hangar because it is SO unrelentingly LOUD that you cannot hear the TVat alland I have great hearing  We eventually realized that the Air Conditioner / Heat Pump individual unit while there IS a wall thermostat only has ONE setting andit is HIGH (Lo and Med still blast at HIGH intensity)  Little by little the fault became apparent to usthis was a cosmetic touchup but the important things were missing likea BATH TUBthere is no tub just a shower with a shower head that barely yields a dribble of waterthe TV is an old TUBE TV and it is blurry and scrambled and two calls to the desk (no one answers the extensions) brought no results  Speaking of the bathroom there is no window no fan and an ill-fitting toilet seat that shifts loudly to one side each time you ""alight""  Many have complained about their odd shoji pocket door to the bathroom which bounces back open and clipped my husband's hand twice As others have mentioned there are paperthin walls APPARENTLY because we woke up at 4 am to watch the news  We are very conscious as we live in a condo to keep our TV down  Nonetheless with this HORRENDOUSLY loud wall unit air conditioner if you want to hear the TV you have to turn it up and we did NOT turn it up as much as we would like to butBANG BANG BANG on our door a few minutes after we had gotten up   The Front Desk Clerk rudely said when I opened the door (which is freaky at 4 am) -""The neighbors complained about the noise and I could hear it all the way down the hall"" - **Note to Manager: GOOD LUCK RAMADA/HOLIDAY INN when it is 110 degrees outside and people have their TV's up much louder than we did to combat the a/c on UNRELENTING HIGH  Trust me there will be multiple complaints every night  Other reviews of this motel have mentioned the same complaints  I was planning on telling the desk clerk when we checked out after 3 nights about some of these ""constructive ideas"" for their own benefit  However the checkout clerk looked like he was NOT open to  input (probably overdosed on complaints) so I refrained  Basically the owners have cheaped out on this major remodel   If you read this Ramada/Holiday Inn Manager at the very least you need to get an electrician to REWIRE the thermostat to get a  LOW FAN setting on the a/c wall unit buy new TVs replace the toilet seat change out the bathroom shoji door and shoot some insulation into the walls  And we're just not all that picky."
4936,"After hearing about Morning Glory Cafe for years we were excited to go with some friends  Everything went down hill from there  The wait staff was slow and seemed put off that they had to work  The service was slow and the staff uninterested  My wife ordered the South Mountain Omelet thinking she would get some good veggies  There were a total of 9 pieces of veggies in the omelet all cut to about 1 and a half inches long  There were 2 pieces of asparagus 2 pieces of string bean 2 pieces of carrot strips and 2 paper thin pieces of pepper along with 1 tiny piece of the end of a broccoli floret  The omelet was luke warm  I ordered the Morning Glory Benedict  The eggs were close to hard boiled with 7 small pieces of ""Home Fries"" and my meal was also luke warm at best  Our small overpriced OJ's ($350 each) were slightly cool not cold  Overall the service was poor to fair the food was fair to poor and the prices very high given what you get."
1085,I don't usually write reviews preferring to lurk However I feel that something is definitely up with all the recent positive reviews on this placeLet me say that many years ago my husband and I loved this place  However after last night we will never frequent again  I will preface with the previous time we ate there (and ate in) and the veggie pizza we ordered arrived with raw vegetables (raw and COLD) all over the top  We sent it back thinking the kitchen was having an off night and thought no further of it until last night  We ordered a pizza for takeout and I picked it up  It was their NY pizza and we ordered it as listed with extra cheese and well done (regular crust)   When they brought it out I looked at it first and I couldn't believe it  The top was covered with raw bell pepper - big giant chunks of it  It wasn't even close to well done and I askedthis is well done  The vacuous server said yes that's well done (she didn't even look)  I said the vegetables aren't even cooked and are barely warm  Also where's the extra cheese  She and the girl behind the counter both gave me professional smile number 2 and said it's thereit's well doneI told them it would be my last visit and left  They were not in the tiniest bit interested in customer satisfaction nor the quality of their pizzas  I did take it home as it had already been paid for and (night before thanksgiving) had no other dinner options at the time  But after getting it home It got worsethe center of the pizza was wet  I don't mean gooey but wet like someone had spilled water on it  We took what we could out of the box and cooked it on our pizza stone but suffice to say it was not a happy experienceIs this restaurant coasting on it's past  I think so  Will leave it to the sheople.
4070,"Well I was just given a good reminder of why I NEVER shop at Home Depot Holy cowstood looking at fans for a good 10-15 minutes before I had to ask for assistance though about 8 employees walked right by during that time Once I did ask for help the employee said ""I would but I have to track down another customer"" Rather than ""I'm busy but let me get somebody to help you""  Another 4 employees walked by when I grabbed one and asked for help Not sure if it was his first day or what but I swear he knew NOTHING He was trying to look things up online and I was having to do it for him Besides if I wanted info online I could have done that from home I wanted a knowledgable sales personguess I went to the wrong place STICK TO LOWES (Not to mention LOWES SUPPORTS VETERANS AND GIVES MILITARY DISCOUNTS)."
4718,"Tried to eat here on Saturday night  I say ""tried"" because we never ended up seeing our server  We were seated promptly in a section with only two tables full  The thing is our server never came  Never  No ""hello"" no ""I'll be with you in a moment"" nothing  Very strange since the place was NOT busy  A confused busboy walked by and another waiter walked by but nobody every came to our table  WTF  We left after 10 minutes  So definitely give McGrath's a try if you want to be ignored."
3154,Warning Danger DO NOT ENTER Gross This place is nasty If I could give it less than a star yea I would have While out running errands over the weekend I decided to be adventurous & try a new place I had never tried So I find myself driving down Indian School rd and see the Chinese buffet sign I thought great because I was not sure what I wanted and with a buffet there are so many choices right WRONG The choices were not many and the food was not good The rice tasted like dirt I had some mushrooms that were good Everything was labeled wrong They had fried chicken wings the size of my pinky If these came off a chicken it must have been a chick The egg foo young looked like scrambled eggs with mushrooms This place is gross We took one bite of everything on our plates and when nothing tasted good we left We told them your buffet is garbage and we left BTW we did not pay for it either.
4003,"DO NOT EVER GO HERE EVER CERTAINLY NOT MSG FREEDIMSUM TAKES FOREVERMADE MYSELF AND PARTY MEMBERS VOMIT SHORTLY AFTERWARDS it is also a pretty big upset when the waiter speaks zero english HAD A RAPTURE-LEVEL EVACUATION OF MY COLON AFTERWARDS THAT CAN ONLY BE DESCRIBED AS A ""THUNDERFURY""."
1761,Today Jimmy John's ran a $1 sub special from 11 am to 3 pm  This was advertised in a Full Page Ad in the Arizona Republic  We went around noon but the line was too long and so thought we would come back closer to the ending time for the deal ie 3 pmWe were there at around 2:45 pm and they told us that they were No Longer Honoring  the Deal  No consideration was given that the customer spent their time and gas to come there with the knowledge that the deal would be honored  The FULL Page Ad in the Arizona Republic specifically said it was till 3 pm and it did not have any exceptions or restrictions whatsoeverI cannot support a local business that clearly breaks its own promise  I will never step into a Jimmy John's when there is Subway Blimpie's Quiznos Firehouse Jersey Mikes Jason's Deli and so many more options.
2851,Arf arfbow wowlick lickOk that was Emilie our Schnauzer's take on Wag N Wash and believe me she loves it there Right there across from Copper Star Coffee sits my beloved Wag N Wash The owners and staff are the nicest of nice I want to just hang out there with them all day Cept for the fact that I usually leave with random dog hair attached to my tounge They have a sort of Ben and Jerry's anti Petco mentatlity and I respect that They have a great stock of toys treats and other poochie gucci things The grooming service is fantastic Forty bucks for a 90 minute groom is quite a deal Cut to me trying to bathe Emilie in my tub and the ensuing waterworks flooding my bathroom floor Me cussing spilling my martini Emilie constantly violently shaking excess shampoo and water all over the walls Not pretty Also provided is a self washing area Well not self washing as in you wash yourself cuz well that would be weird But an area where you yourself can wash your dog They provide with an apron brush shampoos etc and constantly check on you And I can never leave without purchasing their homemade doggie treats kinda pricey at $10 for a bag but their made right there in front of ya and I love supporting the smaller business So wag your tail bitches and get on down to the WNW.
4234,Dont waste your time and money with this company I had Heliocol install solar panels for our pool including a brand new pool pump The system was installed four months ago and never worked We have been calling for service since then and every time someone comes to fix it  the problem stays the same We are going to take legal action They got the money and we got promises.
1950,unPhogettable is PHOnominal Ok bad joke aside this is one of my new favorite Vietnamese restaurants The food is extremely fresh and after talking with the owner I found out that they make everything themselves from scratch with no MSG or prepackages meats The service was excellent and the cafe setting was very inviting Although a bit far from my house I'll make the drive to come back here to eat again.
3107,Worst ice machine on the planet  I wanted hot peppers on the side not on my sandwich  Was refused  Corporate Policy WTF  Lost me as a customer  No one dictates how I want my sandwich made.
253,I love this place besides always being too cold (bring a jacket) the food is always great From scrumptious omelets to delicious pancakes to perfectly cooked bacon Even their coffee is good they offer different flavors throughout the year The pancakes are huge you can get whole wheat (awesome) I usually get whole wheat pancake with blueberries and granola It's a great combo with a side of bacon and 1 pancake fills me up Going here for breakfast is definitely a treat.
3503,Service was very slow Wait staff was not very well educated about the menu  Beer was tepid I had the tacos which were fine and the rice and beans were average The wife had the Chille Verde and she said it was average as well However the waiter forgot to bring the tortillas and we had to hunt him down to finally get them  They had one bus boy trying to pass out chips and salsa and clean the tables it was easy to see he was the hardest working person in the restaurant  However because he was the only person cleaning while the hostesses sat around and gossiped and the manager was hiding someplace the restaurant was full of empty tables with dirty dishes The highlight of the evening came while watching the 2 hostesses continue to place patrons in a booth that had a broken light fixture After being seated each group of guests would ask for the light to be fixed  The first time the manager came over and tried a light bulb which she had swiped from another location in the restaurant only to find that it wouldn't fit She was nice enough to move the guests to another location but within just a couple of minutes the two hostesses had found a new victim to sit in the booth It was comical to watch the show play itself out again and again The bottom line is that the restaurant business is tough  and competition in the Mexican food arena is very strong so  I don't expect this Garcia's location to be around very long.
2162,"The man needed a dress shirt to go with the suit he brought for tonight's event and lo and behold we spotted this place and didn't have to deal with Arrowhead MallWe walked in to a sea of young men getting fitted for their prom attire and a salesmen immediately approached us-grateful to see a few crows feet I am sureHe was great-non pushy and helped us get a shirt and tie that was needed He even steamed the shirt for us so we didn't have to deal with it ourselves$7500 and not a single problem or waiting in line with all the ""boys"" Great service and EASY."
370,Great people will order anything I need (I have horses and they don't keep horse feed in stock at this location) great prices and so convenient Always shop here for all my kiddos (horses and dogs :p ).
3845,I don't know all the details exactly but I was just in there the other day and it appeared that they were having a routine health inspection and I didn't mention it at the time but there were a few roaches walking around  Looks now like the health inspector shut them down for 2 weeks or something like that  Gross.
4073,Horrible service Took forever for the lady to even figure out we were standing there waiting She finally came out didn't even crack a smile and took her sweet time to wash her hands and put on her gloves Probably took her 5 minutes to make the sub Slow and unfriendly The cookie was disgusting and overcooked There was math problems written all over the bag of cookies I might add classy Don't go here.
4057,Needed to kill two hours on a Friday afternoon and knew I could not go wrong with a Native NewYorker Three things appeal to me when coming to one of these franchised restaurants: wifi beer and wingsI needed to work (I teach online) and there wifi was spotty at best First 10 minutes were great and then nothing Just spun and would not connect I even told my serve who just shrugged and acted like my needs were not importantI asked my server what IPAs were on tap and she looked at me like I was speaking Klingon She had absolutely NO idea what I was saying I finally had to convince her to go to the bar and write down everything on tap (not only for me but also for the next poor bloke who wanted a drink that evening) I ordered what she promised to be a Sierra Nevada IPA but definitely tasted like no IPA I ever had before in my entire life (and that's saying a lot) I would've sent it back but she would've been confused even moreWhen I got to Native's I like the wings boneless since I am usually doing a work dinner and need clean hands for my laptop I got my usual honey hot which had absolutely no kick to them and tasted a little like soggy cardboard Not good at allI watched the manager walk around and greet almost every single table around me but never came over Ever I wanted to call him over and tell him my concerns but I wasn't sure where to start & I just wanted to choke down the cardboard chug my flat acid and get the hell out of there.
4121,"HORRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICEMy first visit to this place was today I decided to go with a friend and grab some tacos in the drive-thru I ordered 2 chicken tacos and asked for a little sour cream and guacamole on each one With a soda my total came to $1049 I asked why it was so expensive They told me they had to charge me for the sour cream and guacamole I told them I wouldn't mind paying a little extra but I didn't need an entire side order of each I just wanted a little on each taco I was okay with them charging my a little extra for this but not THAT much extra The lady at the drive thru asked us to pull forward to try and resolve my request As we pulled to the pick-up window the manager poked his head out I told him what I ordered and asked him why it was so expensive I told him I'd be willing to pay a dollar or so extra for the guac and sour cream but I thought it was outlandish to pay that much extra for two tacos His argument was that I would get more for my money I told him I wouldn't eat all that extra sour cream and guacamole and that it would be a waste I told him that I felt like I was wasting my time and that it seemed ridiculous to pay that much for two tacos with a little guac and sour cream His response ""Yes I agree with you that this seems like a waste of time"" REALLY I couldn't believe I was getting such bad customer service and such an attitude from a manager My friend and I were so put off that we drove away with no food and paying nothing The owner of this place should be ashamed that they hired such a terrible managerMy first impression of this place was horrible NICKELING AND DIMING your customers is NOT the way to keep a customer base and a consistent clientele I will NEVER go back They just lost a customer and because I'm well-connected in the valley they've probably lost all my friends as customers as wellNot a good way stay in business in this economy I'm afraid."
3671,Appointment was at 11:15 and it took over an hour to see the eye Dr for the eye exam The Dr was nice but when it came time to pay for the frames the two pair deal they advertised for $69 with a free eye exam turned into $200 I didn't even pick out special frames they were the basic ones that went with their advertised special However I did opt to get the basic plastic lenses with glare resistance which is an extra $60 At the most I expected to pay around $140 but definitely not $200 What they don't tell you is that the basic plastic lenses are an extra $60 as well When I asked the lady any questions about pricing she just looked at me but didn't respond She basically had a it is what it is look on her face Ugh Just ugh awful experience I don't recommend them Go to lens crafters at the mall instead because atleast they have nicer frames for that price.
911,The Thai Basil was delicious and reasonably priced  Very quick service highly recommended.
776,Thank you yelp This place is a do over do over and another do over By far some of the best Vietnamese food we've ever eaten The place is immaculately clean the food is unbelievable and the proportions are more than generous Best part can't beat the prices will be back again probably tomorrow.
2745,Came into town with a group if friends and met up for a brunch OMG  This is great food in a very unique setting The history if this place is just very coolall the buildings in this small area are quaint   Ok back to the foodI love pancakes so I had to give them a try and they did not disappoint  The very gracious owner offered a sample of the apple cinnamon sauce that is nothing short of amazing  It was great on the cakes but even fantastic with bacon  Love itEveryone in our party enjoyed a wonderful meal and was impressed by all  This is a must to return to when back in the area If you come here and don't like it then you certainly have some messed up taste buds.
4928,"How does this place have 3 stars  Impossible  I would rate it at 01 star if I could  What do you do when you've prepaid using a groupon and EVERYTHING except the watermelon looks horrendously awful and tastes just as bad  This was the most disgusting place at which I've ever eaten  In hindsight I see now that I was so absolutely in shock about how vile the ""food"" was that I actually PAID the 12 dollars they said I still owed with no record of a tab or receipt  When I asked why I still owe money after prepaying for the buffet (my first mistake) they said it was for the drinks and tax  Come on now 12 dollars for two teas and a diet coke with no written records (no ticket/bill/check/tab/receipt)  I must have been shell-shocked about the entirely horrible dining experience because I normally would have demanded a written account of our charges  I have never stiffed any restaurant or server nor would I start here but I do want to know what i am paying for and telling me ""$12 for drinks and tax"" is not sufficient  To THEM Mediterranean food means overcooked burritos flavorless lasagna very scary-looking greenish meatloaf curry spring rolls and limp fried onion rings  I will never go back    In regards to service our waiter was wearing jeans and a t-shirt with a baseball cap on backwards  Really  If possible I have to write a second review to lower their rating because somebody needs to warn everyone what a tremendously terrible experience they will have if they eat at this place  My only saving grace was that I was with three great friends and they were enjoyable  All of us agreed that it was not at all good One of my friends helped us wash away the bad taste by treating us to The Gelato Spot afterward which will be a whole different review and a yummy one at that."
3748,horrible business practicesthese guys are telemarketing monsters you know the constant calls even when you've asked them to stop -- its these guysdo not give them your business go somewhere else.
1755,Worst OB office I have ever been to Originally I thought they were great but as my pregnancy progressed they were a NIGHTMAREThe receptionist girls are extremely rude both over the phone and in personThe Dr and PA do not take any health issues seriously Even after a hospital stay they still did not pay any attention to my health needs Their solution for everything is jamming medications down your throat instead of finding the root cause of the issueEven worse these medications are not safe and several of them were Category C which are known to cause birth defects After a few trips to the pharmacy where a Pharmacist told me NOT to take them a change in dr was the only solutionDo not trust your health or the well being of your baby with this office.
3263,ahhhhh why does everyone where this cheap crap Now my daughter wants to wear it This is outsoursing at it's worse It barely makes it through the wash.
1109,Great sandwiches and rootbeer floatsI will return for sure.
1888,"While I acknowledge I got there at 5:05 am - 5 minutes after they were set to close the complete lack of compassion of the people I encountered was quite surprising  Here I am 5 months pregnant with a sick toddler still in his PJs in an obvious rush to make it in the doors by 5 am  The lobby is completely empty and the front door unlocked when I arrive  I hear someone in the back say ""that's not someone new is it""  and another voice responded ""no probably just someone leaving""  Next thing I know I see the people who own the voices I heard - one looks like one of the doctors or nurses and the other like the person who runs the front desk area  All I get is ""sorry we're closed""  With the fact that I didn't make it in time sinking in near tears (I blame the pregnancy hormones) I explain that I had a difficult time finding them in the strip mall where they are located and got stuck at a light  This time I get one word - ""sorry""  I look up to see faces of stone  Nothing  Neither of the ladies offered any suggestion on where else I might be able to take my sick child to be seen by a doctor which we were obviously in need of since we'd come to their urgent care for that very reason   I say ""you guys don't open again until 9 pm right""  I get a short reply ""5 pm""  I then ask if they know when Phoenix Children's urgent care opens  Absolute silence  I know this is technically a competitor but if you care about kids wouldn't you want to ensure a sick child gets the care he needs irrespective of whether it comes from your company or another  I was so frustrated when I left that I did  start to cry a bit as I buckled my son back into his car seat and made my way home to wait the 7 hours until the next pediatric urgent care opened  On the drive home I tried to see the positive side of my encounter- maybe it was a good thing that we were too late to be seen since I wouldn't want such uncaring people to treat my son anyway."
4834,I have always been a fan of Golden Corral and their buffet But this particular location was terrible The food was so undercooked the fried fish was raw (sushi anyone) pizza dough was still raw and the variety was lacking It was not worth the amount we paid for especially for the lunch buffet I would highly recommend going to the location in Goodyear if you're willing to drive a little bit further.
2601,Fail Whale Ok I know this is not twitter so there isn't REALLY a fail whale But if this was they would get oneWe got a menu from them on our door so after getting back from vacation and being completely jet lagged we orderedI was on hold on the phone a while No biggie Finally they took my order  We both went for calzones I figured it was the easiest way to ensure it was vegetarianWRONGNot only did it take over an hour to show up AND they charged us a delivery fee (so two calzones became over $20) but the sauce had a very heavy meat taste One bite and I couldn't eat anymore Not only that but because they put the sauce IN the calzone as well as on the side I couldn't eat anything  I tried to nibble the crustMy partner who is not veggie LOVED her calzone and killed in in about 5 minutes Both of us then spent the rest of the evening in bed moaning and groaning with stomach aches and there may have been a few trips to worship the porcelin gods as wellFail.
2286,Service great French toast sooooo yummy Bacon perfectly cooked how I requested and the bacon is not wimpy Home fries are seasoned with garlic - SCORE I really enjoyed this place The chair was uncomfortable - that would be my only complaint.
2361,I'm normally an emotional mess at airports - it's hard to leave people behind So I actually found a small spot of happiness here in Terminal 4 When walked in here I felt as if I were transported to Portland OR There was a bit of a hipster vibe from the chalkboard menu to the iPad registers to the bow-tied and thick-rimmed glasses baristas I ordered a chai tea latte and it was a well-spiced creamy drink with very large ice cubes It lifted my spirits =].
1724,"Why am I reviewing a grocery store for crying out loud Because this grocery store is a foodie theme park How many grocery stores do you know where you can just hang out with people This is the best place to meet up with friends and the shopping here is not half bad eitherCons Well if want to actually do your grocery shopping here regularly you better buy some extra stuff for friends because you will soon be missing rent payments and living on their couch For the basics it's just impractical to come here but for the occasional ""splurge"" purchase I would come here over AJ's ten out of ten times Really I treat this place more as a great meeting place with things to do than a place to shop."
1497,great atmosphere.
2718,Unique environment Good food (meatball and brisket sliders) and lemonade cocktails on a sunny fall afternoon.
2927,Food is a little pricey but it's organic and healthy so I guess you get what you pay I love the food here You can sit outside on the picnic table or inside with the a/c If you're olives connoisseur you won't be disappointed.
3267,Terrible food at lunchtime Flavorless uninspiring and thus overpriced There is such good food in Scottsdale- just go somewhere else.
3759,I would have never used their service if I had known they would harrass me with repeat sales phone calls They continue to bombard me with sales calls years after they replaced my glass  Even after requesting that they not call they continue to do so This is very unprofessional in my opinion I would not recommend them based on my experience I have used Penske glass and had great experience with them and they have not bothered me with repeat sales calls.
2572,Sanctum is the place to be in central Phoenix on a Wednesday night Its goth themed interior and hot bartenders are definately a huge plus I tend to join my friend on Wednesday who loves to dress in the goth clothes I dont however I just go in club clothes Its very inviting staff and customers make you feel in place The music switches to 80's and some goth its somewhere that you WILL know a song here and there LOL Drinks reasonably priced Beer was like $4 The art in this bar is SIMPLY AMAZING Check it out.
295,Queso Guacamole Amazing tortillas Freshly squeezed Mint LimeadeI loved the environment I felt very welcome and was totally entertainedMake sure you tell them if it is your first visit order nachos and get a surpriseWe will be back.
3061,This event was a great way to start off the new year  We didn't so much screw our resolutions as we aired them for all the restaurant to see starting some good conversations  I loved meeting a few new Yelpers and getting to know others a little betterSalty Sow is comfort food meets sophisticated dining  Appetizers were truffle deviled eggs and a salmon/cracker crudit√© that were a tasty tip of an awesome iceberg  Dinner was served on their family dining table buffet style  Pork shoulder pork ragout Brussels sprout salad beef tenderloin and assortments of veggies sprawled the table and required at least 3 plates for most of us  Everything was fabulous and my fresh sangria complimented the spread perfectly The service was as good as the food  We met the GM and chef partners in Salty-crime  All of the servers were attentive friendly and willing to share tips on the menu It was a great night for sureBig shout out to Salty Sow for opening their doors to us for our first Elite event of the year  Thanks to Lindsey and Yelp for the opportunity and for the awesome new nail files.
4351,"First of all if you go here PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE make sure you check your bill when it comes  honestly  We went here 3 times  all 3 times we were over charged  either the menu's were out of date or we were ""past happy hour time"" (BS) oh and the other excuse we just changed our menu  blah blah blah  Pthen they always have to ""get a manager"" to come to the table which takes forever  (I am sure they hope we leave)  PLUS THE SERVICE SUCKS ASS  this is a definitely bait and switch1st time it happened we just dealt with it and was like whatever2nd time it happened my daughter who just got back from deployment (Navy) wanted to do something special for us and took us all there  My husband looked at the check and noticed it wasy CRAZY over what we thought as we were there for happy hour  The waitress had to get the manager which took over 20 minutes (gimme a break)  finally we took a 30 dollar gift card because we were so sick of 'arguing about it  We discussed it about 20 minutes and we were finally like whatever3rd time  took a friend there  again we ordered devils ale  on the menu it was listed at one price when we got the bill it was almost twice as much  We waited for our server to come back she never did she totally ignored us  I gave her a dollar tip (which is NOT like me i tip very well too well)  and I wrote on the recept why she got such little money as a tip  If you are looking for a fun time go caddy corner to San Filepe's  that place is fun and the staff are friendly and fun  We much prefer there we wll never go to Caddilac Ranch again  They say 3rd time is a charm Well it is its a charm to know you are overspending and its a big gimmick and they dont give a crapoh and if i didn't have to give a star i wouldn't have."
63,I attempted to get my air conditioning serviced here and was quoted 220 bucks just to find out what the problem was Is it because I am female that this was my quote Of course I take my car out of there and go down the street where I was not hustled The guy behind the counter was rude as well to me How this guy is employed I do not know I would avoid this location if you can Huge disappointment.
2941,I must say when moving to Phoenix a year ago I was disappointed with the restaurants around the city  I had tried all these places that were supposed to be just amazing but was always left wanting more  The Coronado Cafe filled my expectations more than I had expected  It was one of the first places I had heard about when I moved here a year ago but never got around to trying it until recently  I was pleasantly surprised with the food and thrilled with the atmosphere  Little houses converted into restaurants have a certain charm about them that big corporate restaurants will never be able to create  The food was fresh and tasty but not overly fancy  They offer a nice inexpensive lunch menu and a more upscale dinner menu  The service was unique meaning I did not feel like I had my own personal server slave for the time I was there  I felt like he was somewhat stand offish but we always had refills etc when we needed them  In all honesty it was nice to not be interrupted a million times by some disgruntled robot of a server who clearly hates their job  So even though the service was not the typical upscale service it was still good it just had its own flavor.
4130,"Lunch went downhill today  we were hungry and decided to stop at Red Robin  To begin with I had to ask the server to wipe off the table  The place had just opened for lunch and all the tables looked like they had been hastily wiped down from the night before and put out to the pasture to dry  Even the menus were sticky  Gross  Burgers were just ""OK""  Lots of sloppy sauce  Nothing to write home about Meh  I ate the meat and left the bun  $22 for two burgers  We won't be back  PS- This place needs a good cleaning."
3396,"It was a lunch time and I was starving Z'tejas seemed to be the only quick option around so we parked our car and got a table The overall design of the place was not bad The service was not bad (fake) Now the food The food was bad-from the presentation to the consumption part was just bad I had the Pork ""tender""loinThe meat looked like it had been sitting in the Atlantic for a few years The onions rings were the best thing in the plate and I use the word ""best"" very looselyMy mother had the mahi She compared it to ""A dried out version of what could've been"" Z'tejas need to stop trying to do 20 things and focus on one type of food                             -Heisenberg."
20,I love this place I've eaten here a few times now and there is not one thing that has not been above standard When ever we are not sure where to go out to dinner this is our go to place just love it.
1529,"As my first Yelp event in the Phoenix area my friend and I had a great time and were both VERY impressed with the eventFrom the moment arriving where we were greeted by Lindsey and then treated to four flavors of delicious gelato the first impression was a very positive one  We then saw english muffins being baked fresh in the ""breakfast for dessert"" area  We made some new friends in the cupcake area (where some Yelpers were decorating their own cupcakes) and shared a few of the desserts before checking out some of the other cakes and cookies (and getting the opportunity to suggest some new cookie ideas for LGO)  Then there were some drinks and water to wash down the delicious snacks  Add in plenty of fun conversations with other Yelpers and finally a great gift bag on the way out with pistachios cookies an english muffin  and some LGO bakery gift cards  While this was an amazing event I have always been a huge fan of LGO whether the bakery pizzeria gift shop gelato or coffee  Thanks to Yelp and LGO for a great evening."
1911,Yes  It's twice as pricey as Gold's or LA Fitness but it's twice as awesome  You get what you pay for at Lifetime  As someone who goes to the gym over my lunch break I couldn't ask for anything more from a gym  It's the little things you don't need to bring a towel soap a locker key or lunch  The caf√© has a nice selection of healthy meals for breakfast lunch kids and even smoothies and the nutrition facts are on the menu   As a vegetarian there are several options for me to choose from   The equipment from the cardio machines to the pool is well maintained and the staff is knowledgeable and friendly  After being spoiled with Lifetime for over 3 years I honestly could never switch gyms call me a snob  I don't care.
1305,WowMy boyfriend suggested this place and when I asked him the type of food he mentioned something about burgersafter taking a look at their reviews on Yelp figured it would not hurt to check it outThe service was great our waitress was extremely friendly and prompt with getting us refills on our chips & salsa - which we needed a lot of because they were amazingly good The salsa had the perfect amount of seasoning to make it spicy enough to have you going for more without burning your mouth off The chips were warm out of the oven and I could have ate a basket fullThey offer Sangria (white or red) by the pitcher - sure enough we ordered a red one It was really good and I was pretty lit after my first drinkI had the Chimichilada - you get a choice of beef or chicken chimi I had the beef and you also get a portabella mushroom enchilada This dish was delicious and will go back for more You get a lot of food on this plate so you will more than likely have enough for lunch the next day and it was just as divine a day laterMy boyfriend ordered the Blue Adobe Hamburger which was voted onto Phoenix's top 10 - hence why I thought it was a burger jointWe had a wonderful experience amazing good and will be frequenting Blue Adobe more often.
4293,He make me a Crown that I don't Need it Screwed my teeth The Insurance says that Is not enough proof for do a Crown I said I will not paid for something that the Insurance said is was right Finally now I found a very good dentist he is trying to fix it but I need to replace it because I was allergic to metal things that Dr Payne never ask before Now I have to paid extra 1300$ because a New crown and Insurance not cover crown if is less that 5 years and maybe I need a Root Canal too so extra money too Thanks Dr Payne I want to send you the bill.
901,Chino is one of those secret places that is anything but a secret  It has been featured on the Food Network Diners Dives and Drive-ins and for good reasonPicture this scene-I am moving from Tulsa to Phoenix for a new Job My future boss wants me to meet him at some run down shopping center for lunch before I even start work I am in town to look at houses in 2005 (yes I got screwed and paid way too much)  So I roll up to this place and think I made a mistake but after having a lunch there I was and am hooked on Chino for life I now live in San Diego but when I go back to see my upside down house I must stop in at Chino You should toowell not the house part The place has the best most unique food of anywhere I have been Asian-mexican fusion  I guess maybe but fusion connotes some sense of sophistication Chino is fantabulous but for goodness sake dinner is served in an aluminum freaking bowl Sophisticated it is not The tables are reminiscent of a bingo hall long with crappy chairs In a location like this the food has to be good or they will end up like the other tenants around them-here today and gone tomorrow Now the food-fantastic  Jade Red chicken is their most popular Think sweet-n-sour but with a spiced red sauce and not nearly as tough to chew  It will be mixed with some brand of rice you choose on the menu such as chicken fried jerk fried white etc My favorite is the Emerald Chicken made up of tender chicken slices with a fantastic green sauce made of Ginger garlic oil and other mysterious but yummy ingredients You pick your meal from an order card you grab inside the door Take a red pen and circle the stuff you want  Yep kinda weird but they can help sort you out at the counter if you need it There is a wall with photos of each meal but it appears to have been taken in 1963 then placed in the Phoenix sun for a few years Forget it Just ask or look around They do have samples which help Oh to make it more confusing there is a secret menu of sorts too such as the 7-11 I don't even know what it is but my buddy digs it the most The grub is great and they finish nicely with a phenomenal fatty sugar cookie No one and I mean no one says anything bad about the cookie Go try this place It is worthy of 6 stars.
3123,"My experience here was awful  The staff acted like we were lepers due to a Groupon and nobody seemed to be able to figure out what the Groupon was offering useven though it was in black and white  The manager was there but completely refused to come out to assist the clueless staff in any way  There was an obvious training issue as the staff stood around like zombies trying to figure out what was going onone after another  I decided to continue through and try the food  Another complete disaster a beautiful looking piece of salmon completely overcooked and ruined  The chicken also resembled a hockey puck  Returned the food barely eaten and did not even want to give the ""chef"" another opportunity to ruin more food on my behalf  Even after all of this the poor bartendernice guy despite being put in a terrible position by his obviously incompetent managertold me that the manager was just too busy to come out and address the situation  Good effort to right a wrong by the bartender weak managing  Maybe the manager was simply worn out from addressing complaints  Never ever again."
4739,I have been to this buffet before and it is usually very good This time it was so bad that I barely ate anything First of all the food did not look appetizing at all It was old and crusty looking The crab legs were dry and unseasoned The place smelled bad and the food area looked dirty My husband took  a few bites of the food my daughter and I took one bite and promptly asked for a refund I had to wait over 20 minutes to get my card credited because the manager was in a meeting I don't think I will ever go back to this place again.
666,What a great little find I highly recommend this place The food is amazing portions small (perfect size) Great atmosphere and service Highlights bone marrow cucumber salad w/ smoked salmon and for a cocktail the strawberry basil lemonade  Can't wait to come back when we visit AZ again.
1901,Yes we live in Laveen and 1 We are DESPERATE for some decent cuisine over here 2 HELP 3 WHY 4 HELP Anyway I am not giving this place 5 stars because of any of the above  if I was back in Orange County oh sorry the Oooo See I would do the same thing And we even have Thrifty Ice Cream there I mean let's be real The only real ace in the hold for Thrifty is that darn coveted chocolate malted crunch that seems impossible for anyone to recreate Scooptacular however has many many flavors that are great and maybe one day they'll find a way to rival the chocolate malted crunch icon The interior is adorable with a cotton candy style color palette There's even a Disney movie usually playing and some pretty decent seating I was leveling off some of my ice cream getting a bit greedy about getting down to my favorite part the rim of the sugar cone meets the melted treat yum The manager came by & said oh is everything ok & I said oh yes I just have TOO much ice cream & I want my cone if that's the worst complaint well there you go  I really hope everyone goes out & supports what is probably one of the best non-chain (ok let's be honest that's pretty much all we freaking have APPLEBEE'S ICK) places around.
2958,Great trendy place with knock out burgers pizzas salads and sweet potato fries If the prepared meals here could speak for it's self it would sound like a Mozart symphony with a dash of Jay Z and Katy Perry to soothe your five human sensesAtmosphere is really mellow relaxing and dimmed light setting which makes your company or people watching a little more easier on the eyes Lol ok so that was deviated a little bit but on a real note the decor and options of seating from the bar high table with chairs(like barstools) patio dining or booth seating is fabulous for  consumers like (moi) who like optionsAlso location is great perfect for those who commute via light rail and love that FEZ has reverse happy hour(HH) all week unlike other places who only offer reverse HH on weeknights and discontinue on weekendsService is always exceptional helpful and friendly Now go and enjoy FEZ you won't be disappointed :).
33,Mmmmmm mazing Fried alligator po boy Best service Staff is friendly Great environment I love it.
748,CARTEL COFFEE LAB  has assumed proprietorship of Sola Coffee Bar and is providing espresso addicts with uber-excellent thick- crema libations made by using a deceptively small La Marzocco machine---TRY IT .
4684,Not sure what everyone sees in these pies Not worth the money.
574,Worst customer service EVER Thank god I spend my 10k somewhere else Glad they only got $250 out of us for my ring  Could not care less that we were customers.
201,So I went back for a 3rd time already  This place absolutely rocks  I could eat here and order something new everytime and leave happy every time  (except the wings see earlier review)Today my buddy Cory and I went for lunch and ate the Creole Q pie which was on their new insert  It was SOOOOOOOO yummy  It had Creole BBQ shrimp with tabasco cheese and a butter garlic sauce  They even give u extra sauce to drizzle over the top for more flavor  I know for pizza traditionalists these pies may not be the type you are looking for but for more adventurous on their pies they have many great options  Thanks again for another great lunch Mellow Mushroom.
170,I'm definitely a fan  The gelato is rich and smooth the staff was really cool about giving out samples and since I was there on a Saturday night the people watching was prime -- lots of cougars and adam lambert look alikes  I got the chocolate caramel and the strawberry combined it was truly sublime  I shall return to the Gelato Spot.
722,Best shrimp tacos in Mesa Hands down Everyone who works here is so darn friendly I love this place Best Mexican food in PHX as far as I'm concerned.
2799,Wonderful bar with a great atmosphere The food and service was quite exceptional I had the shrimp served with sweet potatoes the yummiest My friends both has the beef rib specials again wonderful For sure I will be back.
2966,Really unhappy last night at 10:30 stopped by with six friends and all toppings were put away and chairs were stacked up I think if you are listed to be open till eleven you stay open I love yogurtology but maybe it's time to try a competitor.
673,"We have been coming to Olive Mill since it was just a tiny little shack in the middle of nowhere that was 7 years ago  And look at this place now  It's like our little child that grew up  Let's talk about the location  Yes it's in Queen Creek and it's quite a trek to get here if you don't live in the area but it's so worth it  During the Arizona cool weather the olive trees give a nice shady atmosphere in the front grounds  There is live music on the weekends wine tasting little kids running around and pets sniffing about  My brother from San Francisco says ""It's like TuscanyI can't believe this is in AZ""  Staff:  I have seen them grow as well  They had their growing pains early in the days but now they are like a well oiled machine  Super helpful super friendly and they are there to please  Even if it gets busy on the weekends they are also with a smile  Food:  I would say it is a few dollars more than the usual placesbut this is not a usual sandwich shop either  The portions are big enough to share  We love getting the Antipasto Platter with a couple glasses of wine or beers or a bottle of wine to share and sit and enjoy the afternoon  The sandwiches are awesome  They get all of their meats from the local Pork Shop across the street  The veggies and herbs are straight out of their very impressive garden  They serve breakfast kids menu desserts too  Speaking of dessertsthey have a delicious selection of gelatoto die for  They recently started serving Oven Baked Pizzas on the weekend nights and it's really good  This is Italian Pizza thin crust  They have live music too and the atmosphere is really fun  The Olive Mill is a bonafide mill  They have olive trees and they have olive presses  They have tours so you can learn about the process of making olive oil  They have a super awesome store with all sorts of yummy olive goodnessdon't miss out on the Cup Cakes made with infused olive oilthey are heavenly  This is our weekend go to brunch place  And I highly recommend it They have been featured on Food Network and Dirty Jobs   I'm thinking of having my wedding anniversary in their courtyard somedaycatered by them   Hurray to our big gem in the East Valley :)."
3532,"Pros:Ordered delivery got here fastCons:Wings were clearly freezer burntGarlic ""Flavoured"" crust had no flavourall the toppings (with the exception of pepperoni and cheese) were in a 2 inch circle in the middle of the 2 pies we gotCrust was very hard for being a pan crustAfter all was said and done (2 pies and an order of wings) it was kinda expensive for the qualityThis place has taken the top spot on my pizza to avoid list dethroning domino's."
2339,I agree with two of the other reviewers - this place is horrible  We ordered fish and shrimp combo  It was over deep fried and crispy - almost brick like  I had never seen shrimp so over breaded and cooked that you don't recognize it as shrimp underneathThe monster burger was ok nothing special but piled on with so many condiments (that I was not asked if i wanted) that is was dripping like liquid  And you have to pay extra for the sauces  What.
3562,The food was over-priced the portions were small and really the food was nothing special The service was just so-so as the server brought our appetizer after our entree was served My wife ordered a salad without bacon and they goofed that After they took it back they returned her a salad that was half of what she was previously served and it appeared they just removed a bunch of food from her plate rather than bringing her a new portion Very disappointing experience as I paid a lot of money only to go home hungry and dissatisfied I am certainly not going to go back to this restaurant.
1689,I've been to plenty of gyms Here in Phoenix and in the east coast This has been by far the best gym I've been to It's not huge It's a local central Phoenix gem However all the equipment is in stellar condition It's always clean The staff is incredible The patrons are always friendly And the fact that I can knock out my training and taning all under one roof is awesome The environment lens itself to training as well It's really pushed me to actually start getting some results Lastly although I have not utilized any of the trainers they all seem to be quite knowledgeable Unlike some of the other gyms I've been to before You can't go wrong here Great place Great value.
4046,First time I visited store they weren't open when posted  This was not convenient for myself or the other customer  I left after waiting 15 minutes.
3055,Best Japanese restaurant in the Valley  The service and food are always impeccable.
4327,I totally dislike this candy store to begaig with i went to this place 5 minutes before they close and the open sign wasn on  They said its close come back tomorrow at 9am I went next day at 9am but it was still close never open waited there for 30 minutes and  I went to another candy store the name is Mayra's the lady was very helpful and nice and thanks for letting me express my self.
1312,I love Nagasaki Grill Toh Zan  The owners are very friendly and almost always available  The food is delicious and always fresh  It's a short drive from Fiesta Mall on Southern and it's definitely better than the McDonald's eyesore next to it  I recommend the sushi and my boyfriend loves the chicken katsu  I like the big windows and friendly vibe.
4993,"Well I got this chocolate as a present for Valentines When I met the ""chocolatier"" I was with an African American friend  She completely ignored my friend  She didn't know that my friend purchased her chocolate as a gift for me through a Living Social deal  I love chocolate  I have purchased gourmet truffles including raw chocolate from chocolatiers in different parts of the country  Some of my favorites have been in Portland OR Orange County Ca and San Francisco CA  Her chocolate was my least favorite  Almost every truffle has been out of balance with unusual aftertastes  I am simply not a fan  I doubt that either of us will every buy this product again."
3121,Gross plain and simple  I'll crave some quick Chinese Food and then I'm always upset  What a waste of money.
1759,This is my favorite spa in the world Hopefully I'll make it to othersbut if I could only get to the Camelback Inn I'd be in heaven Here's the rundown of how I enjoy the place: Early morning appointment for massage - Rose does fantastic hot stone - I like her the best Then I shower and get into the eucalyptus steam room Next I head out to the pool and savor the view of Camelback Mountain and the amazing desert landscaping they've procured I drink some water and as I lounge there I order a small healthy and very tasty meal (usually breakfast) I swim a little lounge a lot - regardless of the time of year  If I have planned it I then head back into the showers and clean up for my next treatment I spend hours there and if I feel like I might be pressed for time I reschedule.
1539,one word:  awesome.
4198,"A large group of us made a dinner reservation a month prior and was told upon being stuck in the corner with two crates for tables that they only take ""requests""  The owner came over only to blatantly refuse to take responsibility for the misrepresentation on his restaurant's part and rudely interrupt our attempt to resolve the issue with ""I own other restaurants""  I have never seen such a mistreatment--not even in the snobby town of Scottsdale (no offense people of Scottsdale)  It was unfortunate because the waitress (whose section we were sitting while making plans to move our night) was sweet."
420,This location as all others I've been to have friendly cashiers long waits (since it's so popular and food is made fresh not like Panda Express)  I love the lettuce wraps soups crab puffs etc.
1429,"My husband and I entered the Steaks R Us building and were suprised to see it empty  The advertisement stated it was dine-in but we were directed by the staff to order our meal at the front counter even after I stated we wanted to dine-in  The gentleman took our order and added a 18% tip onto the check for himself  I did a quick math in my head and asked if he added a tip on the check for himself  With a straight face he said ""We are supposed to add a tip on the check""  We had just ordered 2 Porterhouse steaks  He gave himself a over $1100 tip for making us order our food at the counterBEWARE."
4809,This place really isn't worth one star but since that's the lowest option I haveI have been here twice and really didn't enjoy the first trip  I enjoyed tonight's visit even less  We only came here to eat because our favorite restaurant was so packed we couldn't even find a parking spot  I ordered a cheese crisp with chicken on it  It took over a half hour to get our food  We sat there and waited and waited  Our waitress at one point said our food should be up soon and then we didn't see her for another 15 minutes  When my food arrived it was cold  Not wanting to wait another half hour for a replacement meal I scraped all the cold chicken (half of which looked disgusting btw) off the cheese crisp and just ate the cold cheese/tortilla  My mom's cheese enchilada wasn't cooked either  The cheese wasn't even remotely meltedOur waitress took another 15 minutes to bring our bill and asked if we needed boxes  We said no  Another 5 minutes went by and she came back to get the card  By this time I was irritated  She obviously had too many tables and couldn't keep up with her workload  When she finally came back with our card she asked again if we wanted boxes  I finally told her that she should tell the people in the kitchen our food had come out cold  She apologized but after the excessive delays and the cold food it's just not enough to make me want to eat here again  The only good thing I can say is the chips were good.
2996,There is no place that can provide the same level of customer service that you can get at Berning's  The pieces in the store are of the highest quality and are unique  They are not mass produced like the products you see in the malls  Zach and Patricia bend over backwards to fix repair search and find exactly what you're looking for whether it is a new engagement ring or an antique watch.
4597,Don't eat here unless you want hair in your food This is was a complete let down  I had to remind my waitress to get my coffee she didn't get our order right and the was hair in the hash browns GROSS.
4101,Gag  This place is no good  The worst sushi I have ever had  Honestly We ordered a yellow roll and the fish was so old I was gagging and couldn't even swallow  We told the sushi chef and they didn't do anything  They said they would take $1 off  Boo for bad fish and boo for bad service.
447,"Yes This is what every fancy restaurant should be like The service was AMAZING From the waiter's sexy voice to the side dishes arriving at the same time and hand served by the staff Impressed Now that's getting what you pay for The food was delish I had the bone in steak the chef special ""rubbed with 27 different spices"" and yes he/she rubbed it well LOLFor desert we shared ""Mastro's Signature Warm Butter Cake"" this cake was pure insanity it came with hand whipped cream and fresh strawberriesI can't comment on price because my boss treated his staff to this glorious dinner I'm sure he would say it was well worth it :)."
1243,My wife and I ate at Taste of China once a week before we moved away from the area and we've had trouble finding a new Chinese place we like as much  The Honey Seared Chicken is very good in particular and the prices for everything are very reasonable considering the quality of the food  Highly recommended.
393,I've been here a few times and every time has been impeccable  This is by far my favorite fine dining restaurant in the Valley  Fresh local food transformed into the most delicious meals by an amazing chef  If you are looking for the most romantic setting or the best Phoenix food or amazing service or some combo of the above please check out this restaurant  You will be amazed  I HIGHLY recommend the Farmers Feast with wine pairingsAnd if you haven't been to the Farm come a little early and wander around the Farm and check out the chickens and flowers and lovely pecan trees.
3714,I called this business to get an estimate for tile roof repair and no one ever called me back  Bad business ethic  They have an answering service so there is no excuse  Probably if I would have said that I needed a NEW roof I would have received a call  I even gave them the name of the person who referred them to me.
4266,RUDE staff that wouldn't spit on you if you were on Fire mixed up our party's orders ignored us when we needed waters  Honestly it was the attitude of the staff that completely turned me OFF to this historic restaurant.
2451,Not only was the food fast and delicious the service was wonderful The place was busy and still from the hostess to the gentleman bussing our table everyone had a smile on their face and was genuinely interested in our input We will definitely be back.
330,I love this place We ate there last night for the first time Had the St Louis Pork Ribs Can't say enough about the experience and and where else can you get a shot of whiskey along with a Kona Pipeline Porter chaser for 3 bucks early on a Saturday nightThe staff is excellent the service is perfect and the ambience is great Hello WiFi ahh  yes.
2938,Holy Mother of GodI had been going to the WF location on Raintree and assumed all Arizona stores were created equal I had no clue that I was missing out on the most amazing grocery experience of my lifeAlbert H suggested I come here because I am a craft beer geek and the selection at Raintree was good (in my opinion) but he said it was better hereIt's not just the beer selection that is better EVERYTHING ROCKS This is just like the Whole Foods that I would frequent in Southern California--built for an educated affluent consumer There is a full-on cafe WITH a liquor license This week they had a special on Sam Adams Cherry Wheat and Boston Lager which you can enjoy with your delicious mealThe craft beer bar (YES bar) had over 30 different types of beers on draft (handles rotate regularly) and several wines for the oenophileThe seafood bar is diverse with different Ceviches salads and such Soups are plentifulI could go on and on about the rest of the stuff you already know Perfect produce fresh meats etcThe cheeses Yeah tons Thank God I'm not lactose intolerant I won't even tell you how much I spent on cheese Towards the end of my shopping trip I hit the beer cooler I spent a good 30 minutes trying to decide which beers would dance upon my mouth I ended up going with some Dogfish Head beers and fell in loveIf you love good food good beer (and wine) and don't mind dropping some coin then this is the spot Make it rain bitches.
73,delicious delicious delicious Very good food It's so packed all the time And even the coffee or orange juice is so fresh and amazing.
741,Green chili burrito smothered in green sauce and melted cheese rice and beans - time and time again - one of my fav meals anywhere  I have tried green burros everywhere - Rositas is always the best  Chips and salsa (and hot sauce) are the best around -and margaritas are great  Sit at the bar and Mando always is the best bartender around  I love Rosita's.
3265,Little Caesars Marcos Numero Uno etc the fast food of pizza joints Beware places that have pizzas 'pre-heated ready to go'  Quite simply you get what you pay for I don't even put Pizza Hut Papa Johns Dominoes in the same category as these places at least their pizzas are cooked to orderLittle Caesars crust is comparable to cardboard the ingredients are unrelentingly cheap and it's incredibly greasy However the price is unbeatable For $5 you can get a large pizza but it's easy to see why.
3621,This place sucks Food was average and we had to wait an hour even though we had a reservation My americano tasted like warm soy sauce and they blamed it on the RO system The owner made all sorts of excuses and took a whopping $50 off our $1100 bill We won't be back.
1412,I grew up in a Vietnamese/Loa/Thai family the food at this place is reminiscent of the Thai food my family made when i was younger  don't come here expecting the same customer service as other American restaurant because you will be disappointed  - the owner is Thai and his English is only good enough to take your order  so if you want amazing service and non-traditional Thai food - then go to an Americanized Thai Restaurant like The Mint or Malees if you can deal with ok service and want good - authentic Thai food - then come here  and FYI - if you order it medium - it will be super spicy because so order 2 or 25 if you want it spicy.
2124,I grew up in the South eating copious amounts of delicious soul food and as an adult I have traveled a great deal in search of places that can still do it right and I am here to tell you: THIS IS IT folksThe food is indescribably delicious and well executed and the staff could NOT be more pleasant and attentive but one of the most important reasons to high tail it over to Lo-Lo's is because this place is a rapidly vanishing breed and a foodie experience you won't ever forgetAbandon your diet forget counting your cholesterol and treat yourself to a meal that will make you weep with pleasure  Life is too short for Subway sandwiches when a temple of deliciousness like Lo-Lo's graces this weary worldAnd this I vow: I will never visit the city of Phoenix again without stopping to eat at Lo-Lo's  And I can't wait to experience Mrs White's Golden Rule Cafe.
3687,My wife and I took sw flight 
1550,You get what you pay for and at Simply Bread it's worth the price I recommend the challah and the fabulous macaroons I bought a macaroon on a whim one morning after hiking at South Mountain and almost turned the car around to buy 100 more when I bit into it on the way homeMy only saving grace (for my wallet and my waist) is that I'm always at work during their business hours.
322,My favorite place for wineI come here a lot but mostly for the wine The store is cozy and the staff is super helpful Their wine guy here can tell you just about anything about every kind of wine And if you're a World Market Explorer member you can get some sweet discounts tooAnother favorite about this place is the unique treats they have From chocolates to jam the food is great Overall the staff selection and wine make this one of my favorite stores in Happy Valley.
4793,do not use this storage facility   have you ever heard of hidden fees  well if you havent experienced hidden fees before this is the place to go they might price match but soon after you will get a notice in the mail saying you owe a lot more then you expected and on top of that you get a nice big late fee because they dont send you a bill  no email no letter the only bill you get is a jacked up late notice   the managers are not friendly and not willing to work with you sorry guys but a big upset.
2229,The grounds are gorgeous Interior and decor are rustic chic I am in love with this place I will be back for sure :).
2424,the absloute best pizza in old town scottsdale thin crispy crust and prices are extremely reasonable funny thoughone time we ate there the door girl was falling asleep at her desk good stuff.
709,The place is clean and the donuts are very fresh I am a fan of their muffins They use plenty of walnuts on the banana nut muffins I bought a batch for the offcie and I was the hero of the day just that day (Lol) From my observation though they are pretty busy so you better get there early if you want to have a good selection Nice staff too.
288,Stopped here for some early dinner and a beer after driving by Really glad we did- our meal was incredible It's not a big place but it has a fun atmosphere decent sized bar and lots of patio seating which is nice starting this time of year We were greeted as soon as we walked in the door and received excellent service throughout the meal Not a huge beer menu but definitely a solid selection and good happy hour prices ($4/pint $10/pitcher) A smaller menu with excellent choices makes me happy and that's what they offer We started off with the prosciutto wrapped asparagus- really glad we did that Grilled just right and drizzled with a sauce that is slightly sweet made it even better I got the burger my husband got the brisket sandwich and we traded halves Both were very tasty The actual burger itself was full flavor- my only suggestion was maybe a few less toppings I like a burger topped with a few things but this patty had so much flavor that I felt all the toppings almost took away from it The brisket sandwich was the big hit of the night Great flavor in the meat tender and juicy and enough slaw on top to give it a a nice tang and add texture The buns on both sandwiches were excellent and high quality We had our little one with us and they have a pretty good kids menu too It's not listed on the actual menu- the server will rattle it off for you Ours is a grilled cheese fiend and theirs was great- two kinds of cheese on 9 grain served with grilled asparagus and fries We actually asked them to substitute tomatoes for the fries which they easily accommodated and she plowed through the hole thing Minus the asparagus- but that's on her not Grassroots :).
3953,"I came here with a big group and was excited to have a good dinner however that did not happen First half of our party was going to be late so we decided to put in an order of appetizers and order two bottles of wine for the table Ten minutes later the rest of our party showed up Another five minutes our caprese appetizer came then the wine a couple minutes after that Finally after 10 more minutes we reminded our waitress about the garlic bread we ordered and only then did it come to the table Then as the rest of the party was getting their drinks the waitress spilled a tray of three ice teas all over one of the women in my group and her purse Since we were a big party and the waitress obviously messed up I thought it would be appropriate for her to offer to comp some of our drinks this did not happen Later we were ordering all of our food and we decided to just split all of the entrees Since I'm a vegetarian I decided I was going to order the gnocchi to be sure there was a dish I could eat however our waitress informed me they were all out of the gnocchi that night So not wanting to make a big deal about it I informed her I was vegetarian and since one of the dishes my party had already ordered was the Quattro al Forno (which included the Cheese Manicotti Chicken Cannelloni Baked Ravioli and Stuffed Shells) she explained that all were vegetarian except the chicken cannelloni I hadn't really studied the menu so I trusted what she said and told her that i could get by on eating off of those plates Fast forward to when we finally get our dinner someone in my party advocated for me to get first pick at the plates ""without meat"" so I got a stuffed shell and some of the baked ravioli After eating the baked ravioli i started chewing some of the stuffed shell and realized there was indeed meat in it I quickly spit it out but couldn't believe there would be meat in the dish When the waitress came back a member of my party asked the waitress again if there was meat in the stuffed shells and she said no Then I spoke up and said there was and that I had tasted it She responded that she would go check on that She came back a few minutes later and told me what I already knew that there was meat in the shells She offered no real apology to me did not offer to bring me out another dish or comp anything I was so upset and felt so sick after that it really ruined the rest of my dinner and night not to mention I have been vegetarian for six years and this waitress couldn't even offer me an apology for something that was clearly her mess up."
4777,The couple their was very kind unfortunately that does not make up for expired products including perishables that abound in this store (Check out the cheese while you wait)The olive oil on my hummus was rancid If someone was raised on Mediterranean food and feels that this place  is excellent It means you were raised on rancid food and have become accustomed to it.
1413,I fly on standby sometimes and if it wasnt so dirty cheap to fly American Airlines I would fly Jetblue in a heartbeat The service is awful and the flight stewardesses are about as old and crusty as the airplanes I fly this airline every 3 months and they are incredibly disorganized but also for a 4 hour flight you only get beverages with a side of attitude DONT fly it if you have other options.
751,I miss this place so much Im in Bay Area now and I think of Giuseppe's bolognese sauce almost every weekend Their simple tomato sauce is sooooooo good Wish I knew the recipe And the eggplant appetizer is to die for YUMMY I miss you guys.
2760,The best Vietnamese food in Chandlertremendous Seafood Pho Seafood Rice Soup is pretty amazing as well  Huge portions and amazingly reasonable pricesgo for the food it's greattolerate the incredibly average strip mall setting.
4125,"""Uhm we don't give out change here"" yes that's what I was told at the to-go register when I parked a few feet from the door at a metered parking spot by the restaurant and merely asked to break a dollar so our party could eat here  They don't give change  They don't have a dedicated lot - they have metered parking right outside their doors  Grrrrreat policy Mellow MushroomFood is on a par with the other MM in town  Service varies depending on the server many of which have attitudes  Draft list is long but much of it isn't of much interest to anyone who's been into craft beer for awhile  Good location on Mill  Looks like that's why they'll stay in business and for no other reason."
1848,This could be the worst food I have ever had The fact that people wait in line for this defines that many people either do not have any taste buds or simply do not care how there food taste My wife and I both ate one bite out of the meals and that was it Unless you are only trying to feel a void this is the last place to come Sorry farm house need to work on the food.
1101,Try the potato cream cheese bread bowl or chicken pesto sandwich Then relax in Changing Hands afterwardperfect date night.
1469,great food great prices and fasthave been going for 4 years   yummy .
3236,"The family and I are in town for Spring Training and we were looking for something low key near our Hotel  With such great reviews we pulled up at 7:30 PM on a Sunday and I expected to have to wait for a table  There was ONE other family in there eating  That should have been a sign  We were sat by a really nice young waitress  She took our drink order but was not very knowledge about the wines available  We ordered a house Chianti and a house Cab Sauv  The wine came out and smelled like stinky socks  The ""Anti Pasta"" was a little bit of mystery lunch meat on top of shredded iceberg  I thought the stench I was smelling was my Wine fermenting while we were there  The was a sewage smell in the air  When I went to the restroom I walked into a wall of sewage smell  It was pretty bad  That was it for me  The pizzas came out but at different times and it was actually decent but I couldn't get the sewage smell out of my nose hairs  Maybe if you went in didn't order wine didn't order an ""anti pasta"" didn't sit at the table closest to the bathrooms and ordered a plain cheese pizza you would like this place."
737,This has to be my favorite breakfast spot  I love the crunchy edges of their pancakes  Even when they are packed the food quality is consistent    I am a happy girl.
4364,"Resort I don't think so We spent over an hour getting moved from one room to the next trying to find a halfway decent place to sleep 1st room: Strong mildew smell2nd room: Cigarette Smell (later found out the building used to be a smoking building)3rd room: Toilet was broken and made intermittent sounds4th room: Lighter mildew smellWe were so tired by the 4th room that we gave up moving rooms and just decided to call it a night Each time they sent someone out with a new key (a 15+ minute process) Then we'd drive to the new room only to find the next problem and start the wait all over againThe rooms feel more like a motel than anything else They have those old-fashioned motel-style AC units that are ridiculously loud Don't pay more than $40 for a night in this ""resort""."
2858,This place is deceptive The lobby is recently renovated kind warm receptionist free parking but OH MAN are the rooms disgusting I don't know if they are currently under renovations but my room was old and dirty Some points of concern:Trash was still in the trash binsKitchenette looked like it hadn't been used in years and the fridge had a strange smellWeird spare day bed in room with sheets that looked like they hadn't been changed in a whileWallpaper peeling off the wallStrange locked closet in my room Creepy dudes hanging out in the parking lot ALL DAY Paper thin walls This place will do if your traveling through for 1 night but these rooms are set up for extended stays - I wouldn't want to spend any length of time in there.
3130,I had Isabel's come clean my house before the holidays and was very unhappy with the work that they provided They advertised up to 4 hours of deep cleaning and it looked as if they had spent 10 minutes in my house When they arrived I agreed to pay and extra $40 to have the baseboards fans and oven cleaned and when I returned the only thing that was done was the oven I called to complain and to ask for a refund for a Weekly Deal I had purchased as a gift for my sister in law because after the work that they had done I wouldn't even gift their services to my worst enemy I sent 3 emails and have never received a return response PLEASE don't hire this companyspend your money elsewhere.
3448,I have called Kane and Jason at least two times each today as well as emails to find out how and when they are going to correct the massively out of level garage cabinet install  The price is low but where is the customer support when YOUR team makes a mistake  I will update and edit this review as the problem is either taken care of or ignored.
2884,"I can't believe that there are ANY negative reviews of Honey Bear's  I've been a customer for decades having started when the owners and founders were smoking meat in a converted 50-gal drum outside the original East Phoenix locationI now frequent the Central Ave location and the food is still as good as it's always been  If all that matters to you is ambiance this is probably not the place for you Honey Bear's is all about the foodSomeone complained that the pork was too soggy  Another that the pork was too dry  HOW can it be both  The pulled pork IS ""soggy"" because it's JUICY  Honey Bear's pulled pork is to DIE forSomeone actually dissed the barbecue sauce  I've been hitting barbecue joints from the Mississippi to all points west and HB's sauce is hands-down the best I've ever found  The only complaint I have is that when I tried to order the baby back ribs (the best thing that has ever been in my mouth) I was told that they are no longer carrying them but are now offering spare ribs  So I tried the spare ribs and while they are good they just don't compare to the baby backsI had never tasted ""collard greens"" so I decided to try them  Now I'm hooked  Since I liked them so much as HB's I ordered them when I went to Notorious PIG another barbecue restaurant I had to throw those awaythey were loaded with vinegarI will continue to buy the mouth watering pulled pork pulled chicken and collard greens from Honey Bear's even though I now live miles away (and right between two other BBQ restaurants)  And for other HB's fans ""Deal Chicken"" frequently offers coupons for Honey Bear's which cost $15 for $30 worth of food  Beat THAT."
1416,Did you know it was $79 for walking in the door for one day or the way in advance tickets were $90 for TWO DAYS not just one dayYou really couldn't go wrong picking either day both were Great You didn't have to wait long anywhere and water was provided for you Many Area Restaurants participated and tried to impress you with tastings to razzie and dazzle youOn Saturday many offered good salmon but the one who nailed it was Switch Restaurant with a seared salmon unlike anyone's with a polenta cake arugula salad and a tiny Parmesan cheese crispThe most beautiful eye popping salad came from St Francis Restaurant with greens I never saw before so colorful so many textures words can not describeHeirloom Beets were popular and District American Kitchen had them in a easy to eat  cone salad with strawberries that was very good and North also had them in a salad with house made ricotta and fennelMaizie's  Cafe cooked up some real corned beef Reuben's on a marble ryeSome wineries and breweries were represented and one highlight was Mary Edwards with a very good Russian River Valley Pinot Noir conveniently located near all the SalmonThe one dessert that wowed me was the gold dusted lemon raspberry macaroon from The Four SeasonsOn Sunday Kobe sliders and Turkey apple sliders from RelishThe best pork might have came from Barrio Queen and her side of corn in a cup was so tasty anyone would agreeThe Breadfruit made great seasoned Mussels (who knew)Large shrimp in chili oil came from the House of TricksMaybe the best prepared fish was the Steal head Trout from Kai it just melted in your mouthI wasn't in a head cheese mood so I didn't try the fancy looking plate of head cheese from Petite Maison but I'd guess it was goodShort Leash dogs had a mini buffet spread of hot dogsTuck Stop had good muffulettas and Tammie Coe had very tasty Crack CakeBetty's Nosh had several of their popular mushrooms and a yummy light custardy light carmel bread puddingI couldn't mention everything that was good more more wasOnly one place I thought didn't do well preparing food in an out door environment all the meats were over cooked and dryThe only downside was some things that I liked the most I didn't see offered on the restaurant's menus that they came from.
2116,"Went tonight and had an AWFUL time due to a few staff members All went all right before the horrible encounter with a staff member named Christina (a server) Got there early to play some games and then take up the awesome $799 unlimited bowling after 9PM Christina came up very friendly and nice on her first trip over but as soon as she realized we weren't going to rack up a large alcohol tab she soon lost interest After getting some water 10 minutes after we asked for it we decided we felt bad not getting anything else to drink so we ordered a Shirley Temple she brought that to us without even letting us know she just put it down and left After our friend finished her drink she was ready for a second We waited about 30 minutes before I finally had to go up to Christina to ask for more As I walked up to her I get to see her sitting with some customers on her phone She rolled her eyes when I asked for a drink and then proceeded to tell another server Stacy about how ""rude we were for asking for a drink when she was clearly busy"" As she is telling her she points us out and Stacy rolls her eyes at us as well We finished our games and it was nearing closing time so you would think she would be getting her tabs ready but no she was flirting with more customers sitting at their couches and ignoring her PAYING customers I then had to ask another server for our check who happened to be Stacy to my surprise she was at least friendly to my face She was upset as well to see Christina sitting on her phone AGAIN She made her get my check and I gave her my money and asked for change because we were not going to give her a tip clearly She slammed my change down and walked away without saying anything That was the point I realized I needed to let the company know that they have a bad seed ruining their paying customers experience at an otherwise fun and friendly place I then went up to her to check her name and the other co-workers name Her response was  said in an extremely rude tone with a roll of the eyes and a smirk on her face This was completely unacceptable I would LOVE to hear from a manager from this location to discuss the poor behavior this employee displayed as well as the poor experience that me and three others paid to have My email is rebeccarwoods@aimcom Please contact me."
2472,Still one of our favorite places that we eat at a couple times a month I hope people are supporting this place as I'd hate for them to close.
3389,"UGGGGH It is red Lobster what do you expect Red Lobster is the Denny's of seafood It is garbage with a ton of salt on it It is not going to change No matter who thinks it is ""Good"" it isn't."
4313,"Looks like I'm one of the few guests who wasn't ""dazzled"" by this resort which I suppose is a good thingWe stayed there for just one night (thankfully) in early summer and I can definitely say it will be the last time The rooms were halfway decent but only somewhat better than a $39 Howard Johnson There were so many coats of paint on the wall the doors didn't close properly and my room had an unrestricted view of the parking lot even though we'd specifically requested (and were promised) a room overlooking the pool area As I've come to expect from high-dollar low value hotels this place wanted to nickel and dime me to death I mean seriously they charged $6 for a $099 bottle of water and then if that wasn't insulting enough in very small print revealed a $2 ""Restocking"" fee whatever the hell that is so all in all you were afforded the opportunity to spend $8 on a lousy bottle of water Oh and then there was the wireless internet You know the same internet that is free at Marriotts Hiltons and other reputable hotels No at this dive they wanted $1995 per day for the privilege of using the internet If you wanted to use the business center they'd only charge you $10 for 10 minutes How generous of themIn hindsight tho it's probably a good thing we didn't have a pool view because the pool area was disgusting There was trash and sand all over the place the pools were filthy and cloudy and smelled of urine and half of the poolside furniture was broken All this can be yours for the bargain basement price of $129 per night IN THE SUMMERNever again."
3568,I brought 9 shirts to be pressed and heavily starched The starch was  left with powdery residue all over the shirts ( all of them ) They must have a new press machIne that adds folds wrinkles and uneveness to garments because that is exactly what I got back In addition when I called to explain the situation I was told they could either send them out again ( which i did not have time for) or refund the cost I brought 1 of the garments back to the store and then the run around began After being told they didnt need to see all of the shirts just an example of what I was not happy with I arrived with my shirt and they then said I needed all 9 shirts to refund my money (  bs bs bs bs bs bs) if you said this on the phone then I would have brought all 9 shirts with me Next one of the female workers was totally unprofessional condescending borderline rude uncaring more interested in being right then customer service patronizing and just wrong in every way I was told a flat out lie ( twice ) and she was tripping on her tongue trying to cover it up Avoid this cleaners at all costs .
4074,This place was about as bad as an airport bar and restaurant can get  When I first walked up and asked if they had power outlets to charge my phone while I got a beer and burger the bar tender rolled her eyes and acted like I was asking an unreasonable question  Do to the limited choices I stayed anyways but should have ran  They are not a brewing company just a bar with basic beers  The worst part of the entire experience was the burger  Completely disgusting  Do not order a burger  It was a frozen meat concoction that tasted more like fillers than beef  My came out pink all the way through and bar tender said that is how they cook them  I took two bites and could not finish it  Horrible experience and still a dead phoneerrrrwhat a waste of time and money.
3218,"Disgusting  All of the print ads this ""resort"" has is totally misleading and false advertising We went on 4th of July weekend The place was packed and gross The grounds weren't kept up Our room had roaches The pool area was ICK The place is extremely dated Needs rehabThe food at their on site restaurants is sub standard at best Frozen food thats cooked Tasteless Service was blah at best The Hilton name would be ashamed if they knew how this dump was being run Shame on management."
836,Blah and yuck Basically a buffet.
3994,"I went to lunch here at Ra on Ray 2/18/13 with a co worker The place was not that busy at all (I can see why) We were not greeted by a server for at least 15 minutes Then a bus boy walks by and we asked him if we had a server (it was supposed to be Nichole)  Then a manager comes by and sees us looking at our watches and all around for ""Nichole"" I see a blonde servers back to us a few times (Nichole) never even looks over at us The manager takes our food order back to the kitchen Nichole makes an appearance and before I can ask for a drink she swirls away We ask the server from another area if we can order our beverages from her so she takes our drink order Finally my salmon carpaccio comes luke warm and the sauce is NOT the correct taste too much wasabi-mayo not even close to Mesa or Scottsdales carpaccio my co worker gets her miso soup and is not even finished when ""Nichole"" walks up grabs the bowl and says ""are you finished"" my friend doesn't like people touching her food while she is still eating so she tells her to go ahead and take it It has been 35 minutes now NO drinks and the rest of our lunch nowhere to be found So we just walked out LOUSY food LOUSY service or rather ""NO"" service unbelievable   I was so shocked because I have never had a bad experience at the other Ra's    PS the portions were so small they might as well use smaller plates now :(."
2320,These cupcakes are unbelievably good  They are $350 a piece and a little larger then average size but worth every penny  I bought 6 different kinds and every one was delicious  The cake was very moist the filling was fantastic and the frosting was heavenly  What a great treat to have such a great cupcake bakery in our neighborhood.
1335,After Audrey kicked me out of the pad I went for a drive I ended up in north Scottsdale with an appetite killer I found this Jack in the Box out here in Boondock Ville I ordered the Jumbo Jack no cheese 2 tacos and a Diet Coke I parked in the parking lot next to the Drive-thru I ate my meal Smoked a pack of cigarettes and watched cars show up and park in the shade It was around 2 am I pulled up thru the drive-thru for a second time and ordered a large Diet Coke I asked the attendant for directions for the Maricopa Food Handler Card Department The address read Peoria I always get Peoria and Paradise Valley confused.
2359,I am SO impressed with the haircut that Danny gave my son this week Danny has such skill and expertise a true artist at his trade Absolutely the best haircut ever Easy to get there too right off the freeway directly across from Anthem Outlets Thanks Danny.
1370,Astounding food and drinks I really can't say more.
2646,My favorite mall in the Phoenix area and one of my favorite malls on the planet The mall itself speaks luxury and completely puts you in an upscale environment The area around the mall compliments it even more and you can't help but love the mall inside out The people who shop here aren't the friendliest and some seem to think they're above God but that don't stop me from loving the overall experience of shopping here The mall is also the location of the first ever Microsoft Store and the largest Dillard's store And you could always find me shopping in places like Express Guess Armani Exchange Burberry and others I can't seem to get enough of this mall and seem to compare all upscale shopping malls to Scottsdale except for the ones in Vegas.
4703,The poor quality of the products alone makes this place not worth it Processed cheese on a breakfast bagel Not sure what happened to this egg pattyThe bagels taste good but are chewy and too dry on the outside Sure it's cheap food but you get what you pay for: A slimy breakfast bagel.
546,Koltton and his staff are AWESOME  The best facial I have ever experienced and the prices are amazing  It is perfect for those who choose not to spend enormous amounts of money at pricey Hotels and spas  Koltton is very professional and highly sincere  For a men's facial (which is about 1 hour long) you can expect to pay about $70 depending on how much your skin is in need of attention and the type of facial you choose  There are extras included one of which utilizes these heated pads prior to the massing of special oils into your aching feet and hands   Scalp massage and even a little reiki complete your facial-Heavenly  There are many other services offered and Koltton says he will wax anything  Okay  May I just point out the men's nose wax  Yes I know  Having hot wax placed up your nostrils and then yanked out sounds sort of UN fun but the results are incredible  No more itchy nose It takes just a few minutes and costs only $8  What a screamin' deal  It really does not hurt that bad  Now eyebrows are another thingOuch.
86,"if you have seven dollars to spend on a sandwich you can get a footlong from Quizno's or Subway or you can get an 8-incher here and realize exactly why you hate Quizno's and Subway The place is marijuana-themed I thought this was cute the first time I came here since I'm from California where it's virtually legal and this was in Arizona where Pot hadn't been legalized yet (Although the girl who made my food told me that AZ has recently legalized medicinal herbs but that's a whole different story and review)The bread they use is baked fresh every day in a nearby bakery Their ingredients are better than Subway or Quizno's and their prices are moderately high but well under 10 dollars and completely worth it Everything on the menu shares a name with a strain of marijuana or something from pot culture I liked that they're permanently unable to supply a sandwich known as ""Schwag"" and their pork sandwich is called a 5-0Other points of interest are their photos of Chong eating there Kool-Aid on tap next to their soda fountains and a huge mural covering a wall and a half depicting what appears to be Adam and Eve smoking blunts in Eden Of course there are stickers everywhere flyers for raves and parties near the sandwich prep area and really friendly staff I honestly can't find anything wrong with this place other than the fact that they're a lot harder to find outside of ArizonaThese are honestly among the best sandwiches I've ever eaten at a restaurant And though the place has a very heavy commitment to its theme it avoids feeling gimmicky and the food is definitely the star attraction I make a pilgrimage to this restaurant every time I'm in the area."
3579,I went there last week for the first time Was pretty excitedmy cherry getting popped and allThe menu board was nice and bigeasy to readThat is the one star place was clean and floors were shinnyA friend of mine was eating there when we went in to order and he said I love this placeI was pretty excited that it would be really good because he is smartI am quite the food snobFYIOMGso we had to tell the gal 3 times the order was to goOur 2 meals were of course cold and I live less than 1/2 a mile awayThe sides 2 beans and green goo- were scary and the guacamole goo some green looking  stuff was from a canMy fish tacos were terrible and the fish was over cookedI will never go againso sorry my smart friend.
745,"Just picked my dog up from Sonoran Desert day car where they'll happily wait around for 5 minutes for you - they love people's business there Immediately left there and called Wag-n-wash of Scottsdale where they must have more business than they want Just having moved from Castle Rock where they have another store with a different owner that ran a GREAT business we're now in Phoenix where we thought we'd find the same Nope not so much Called after the pickup to make sure they are open said I need a dog wash was told to be there before 7 no problem They close at 8 Got there after driving from north Phx to south Phx there by 6:40 Was told by the young man that we had to be done by 7 my wife said ""maybe a few minutes after will be ok"" - get this - his reply ""well no you're just too late We HAVE to clean AT seven"" Like I said must have to much business Oh and BTW wouldn't even give me the owners name to call only a managers name Poor guy that owns it won't even know how people are tanking his business Too bad Colorado store was great Not do much here in Phx Bill@usa-onecom."
965,I flipping love sub factory I used to eat these subs every day and tonight I found their frequent punch card in my wallet I've had it since high school I totally plan on eating these subs again I forgot all about it My order: Turkey on white with onions and banana peppers and provolone sometimes lettuce The turkey is shaved very thin and it's piled on the bread is so chewy and perfect The onions are sliced very very thin as well and it makes them so easy to eat Seriously I LOVE sub factory Definitely get an otis cookie while you're there too I always see cops and business men whenever I go in the space is small but clean with quite a bit of sitting space.
1018,Good Pizza gets a little soggy if you don't eat it right up He needs to get those mesh metal plates that sit on top of the plate so the juices of the pizza don't make it soggy Nice outdoor experience Staff was very attentive We went on a Saturday after the Phoenix Farmers Market was done The owner came out and talked to us and asked us how the food was Very nice person Will go here again Great place for families.
3388,I went in to do some enlarging at 3AM as the FedEx Office is 24 hrs There were 3 individuals sleeping at the computers and 1 sleeping next to the register 1 had an IV drug needle on the desk by the computers I spoke with the FedEx employee who indicated she knew the person and he was diabetic Now I am sympathetic to both the homeless and handicap but 1) I dont care if he is diabetic and 2) I dont need to see a needle used or otherwise on the desk AND 3) the needle was put in a regular garbage can not a biohazard can like at a hospital This not only puts workers at risk but is pretty scummy too The employee seemed to know that these people were sleeping in her store but didnt seem to care when I mentioned it Basically if this is what FedEx Office wants to be known as a homeless shelter than fine But I never associated FedEx with this kind of situation and I am very hesitant to go back or recommend this location to anyone I could handle the sleeping but the IV needle on the desk was too much.
391,great music reasonable cover and strong drinks.
1266,5 Stars all the way If you are looking for a new place for breakfast and want to try something different the breakfast club is the place to go  Great service great location great menu and great atmosphere  Also has a great patio to eat outside.
3835,"I would never recommend living in this apartment place I've lived in several wonderful apartments throughout downtown Phoenix and Tempe but never have I experienced such a terrible living situation as I have at Mill Pointe Aparments Here are the reasons why:1 constant crime area: gunshots homeless walk freely through the property grounds strangers/possible harmful individuals knocking on your door pretending to be servicemen police constantly driving through but never actually doing anything etc when coming home at night time ive noticed plenty of clearly ODD people sneaking around the parking lot looking through cars in one instance i saw a man that lived in an apartment at mill pointe chasing after a man with a mask claiming he was looking through the windows of his home watching his family2 mgmt company: every time i have called them for a work order or alterations to my lease or any kind of question the manager of the complex is ALWAYS ""out in a meeting"" and/or unavailable no matter when i call morning noon or evening after becoming upset about this recurring problem i called and once again they told me jennifer the manager was in a meeting so i walked down to the offices and there was jennifer in her office alone with the door shut (i could see since her since her office has a window) I have also called on many occasions during business hours for work orders and no one ever answered the phone for a few hours3 the apartments: had a bug issue upon moving in flies and gnats everywhere my neighbor had told me upon her moving in her refrigerator was infested with dead cockroaches the apartment was not cleaned (mold ring in the toilet) and numerous inconsistencies within the infrastructure such as holes to nowhere under the sink and in certain areas of the floor boards when they connect to a wall or cabinet4 work orders or issues with living conditions: water was shut off for multiple days without warning or notice i nor did most of my connecting neighbors have hot water for over 48 hours MULTIPLE TIMESI called one sunday because my front door would no longer lock (the door was splitting in half) the serviceman complained about having to leave his home on a sunday to fix my broken front door he didnt fix anything but tighten the screws of the deadlock i explained to him ive done this numerous times but the door continues to loose grip of the lock since it is splitting down the middle he refused it was an issue with the door and refused my request to replace the door altogether rendering the safety of my apartment completely unimportantAll other complaints I have about this apartment complex is minuscule compared to the ones listed above STAY AWAY."
108,This place is really quite awesome I've been here a few times- the most recent time was to get stuff for my last minute Halloween costume And they had it RIGGED up They had these rather intimidating men in security vests (who were actually very nice) directing traffic flow into their lot I got there at the right time- swung up waited maybe 30 seconds for somebody to back out before pulling up and parkingThere is actually two parts to the store On the west side is the costume rental side and on the east side is the actual store itself where you can purchase almost anything you want if it's related to costumes fancy dress and whatnot Service at this place is consistently pretty excellent I've been during peak and off peak During peak nobody bugs you if you don't want help but they are more than willing to help you if you do I was able to get in get a white foundation black eye cream a powder and green spray on hair dye very quickly with the girl's help I went once ages ago as well during off peak for extras as part of a cosplay outfit for a convention The same thing- it was a lot quieter but they were helpful when I wanted them to be left me alone otherwise This place really is a gem They have beautiful wigs all quite a nice quality pretty inexpensively priced Their range of makeup is astounding and they've got all the knick knacks you might possibly need for any outfit I'm sure if you had a particular idea but possibly weren't sure how to execute all you had to do would be ask your salesperson and they'd direct you and give you ideas Since I plan to cosplay for a con again next year I'd imagine I'll be in to get a wig and other accoutrements The interwebs is good and all but there's something to be said for being able to go to a store and see right there what is available Plus I think I might need green lipstick.
645,I have been to Beckett's Table many times in their years of existence Each time is as great as the previousMy most recent visit was during the peak of the Holiday 2013 season and seven of us showed up on a Friday night (after having called ahead to several other restaurants and being told that the wait time was 90+ minutes) Upon our arrival we discovered that the restaurant was packed as usual but even though we didn't have a reservation they could seat us on their outdoor patio in 5-10 minutes Initially we were hesitant to sit on the patio in mid-December but it ended up being very pleasantly warm since the space was enclosed and had outdoor heatersIn my many visits to Beckett's Table I early on inadvertently complimented the owner on their service and delicious chocolate truffle dessert (no longer offered) From that moment every time since I came in and she saw me she would magically procure the truffles from the kitchen even though they were longer listed on the menu This time we warmly greeted each other and exchanged holiday pleasantries But alas they no longer kept the truffles even as special treats I mentioned that our group of seven was a reunion of sorts and that our little group included a New York foodie Well after consuming a delicious appetizer/entr√©e meal (of which the foodie raved) the wait staff brought us a sample of all the desserts (in a trough no less) compliments of the owner We were stunned and grateful (maybe ordering a lot of wine and padding our bill had something to do with it) So once again my experience at Beckett's Table proved to be a wonderful culinary experience with the personal attention from the owner that adds that specialness to each dining experience there.
4970,We came here on a Saturday afternoon The place didn't seem very busy when we came in But the hostess did not acknowledge us for at least 10 minutes before we were finally asked how many and another few minutes before we were seated and when we were seated the server never came We had to leave after 20 minutes of sitting with no drink order & no server coming to the table It was terrible and we won't be going to the Gilbert location at San Tan any longerafter we left we went to the Chandler location and the service was excellent :).
1638,I cannot begin to say just how intensely pleased I am with the service I received with Chris and Phoenix Body Works Had body damage on my fender and bumper from a blown tire on the freeway and when I was calling for quotes everywhere I called was giving me prices way higher than I could manage and most of them offered sub-par customer service  When we called Phoenix Body Works Chris gave EXCELLENT feedback on what we were looking at and asked us to email him pictures of my car He called back later that day just to say he hadn't had a chance to look too deeply at it but to ensure us he would call us the next day How's that for customer serviceWhen he finally did send us our quote he was several hundred dollars cheaper than our next best offer and that was including paint He had offered the most feedback and advice and the best customer service to that point by far and with the huge price difference we were sold When we brought the car in he also offered an alignment for an additional $65 and warned us that with additional small parts (bolts etc) our total may come to about $50 more than our original quote and that he would try to get the paint to be as close a match as possible but made no promises We felt that he was really doing all he could for us and agreed that a mismatching car was better than a non-driveable car so we agreed to the jump in price and resigned to the paint situationBUT WAIT When we picked up the car (which was completed very quickly) it looked PERFECT The paint was a perfect match and even the broken pieces that were only repaired and not replaced looked brand new You'd never know my car was ever damaged AND our total was even lower than our original quote in spite of the extra work he did PHENOMENAL I fully intend to recommend Chris and Phoenix Body Works to everyone I know He did such an incredible and professional job and gave us unparalleled customer service along the way.
4455,I new this place sucked from the last time I ate here but for some odd reason I was tempted to eat here again well I was right it still sucks I had a hankering for spagetti and meatballs first I will say the sauce was watery and had very little flavor the meat balls tasted like a lot of filler and also had a strange flavor the bread stick was ok .
1170,What better way is the to spend a Tuesday night than with an amazing yelp event and friends The bingo event was so much fun I couldn't believe that I actually found someone who has visited Australia  I apologize to all hose people that had to put up with my imitation kookaburra laugh and song  The new bar menu was a tasty treat that doesn't disappoint My favorite thing of the night had to be the spinach artichoke chicken flatbread  The nachos were a close second  I only got to try the rum punch but it was delicious  The Mescato margarita and appletini drinks all looked like the could be gobbled up  Our table's server Nicole D was phenomenal Extremely friendly and personable and always willing to do a little bit more to make the evening great  I look forward to visiting them again so that I can try some if the things that I missed.
4303,"At least American Junkie is honest By including the word ""junkie"" in their title they let you know up front that they are a manifestation of the word Also spelled as ""junky"" this adjective can be defined as - ""having the quality (or being like) junk cheap or of low quality"" - and it perfectly describes everything about this placeThe laughably long line of people waiting to get in on a Fri/Sat night JunkyThe bouncers Unbelievably JunkyThe patrons you meet once you finally get inside the bar JunkyThe food JunkyThe too crowded bar area JunkyThe wait to get one measly drink JunkyThe service JunkyThe wait staff that is more concerned about their looks than their tables JunkyThe dance floor filled with d-bags and wannabes JunkyUnfortunately I've been here more than once (not voluntarily as once was more than enough) and I always have a junky time I don't like to waste my time doing junky things as Scottsdale has so much more to offer and I also don't like buying junky things Basically it comes down to the fact that I refuse to spend my hard earned dollars at a place that continually promotes a junky atmosphere and junky customer service."
3058,This place rocks  Went in the other day and tried the Mushroom burger super tasty you can pile the toppings high as you like  The onion rings are pure goodnessVery friendly staff just be patient as it takes a few minutes to prepare.
2528,If I could give Burger King no stars I would I used to love BK but they are skimping so bad now on the quality of there food it tastes like complete crap I used to stop here on the way home from work and have a double whopper and frys I really looked forward to it but not anymore There food went from juicy and good to dried out garbage I kept going thinking maybe it was just a fluke but it wasnt It never got back to being what it used to be Its just disgusting The flavor has changed the texture has changed everything else good has changed I am done with BK for good Jack in the Box is always good and you they have a great selection of food I think I will stick to Jacks from now on.
585,We went back to Crudo for another visit this time to try the food Oh My God Run don't walk to have a meal there Incredible The boyfriend and I each did the 3 items for $35 and between tasting each others' plates we were absolutely thrilled and stuffed I can't wait to go back again.
754,Not like Roka Akor needs another 5 star review but it really is that good Went there on Friday with the GF BF and sat at the chef bar This is a great spot to watch all the amazing creations come out of the kitchen whether it be the sushi chefs or the grill Our server was fantastic and very attentive and the manager was wonderful (great wine recommendations) Both had great suggestions and they were more than happy to accommodate our gluten free requests (FYI - they have tamari in house) We started with the edamame butterfish (amazing) and the scallops (heaven) These are not large portions and we were starving but everything was delicious We then moved to sushi were the BF found a common love for special salts (pink house made curry black volcanic green team and finally truffle) with the manager From that point on we were hooked on this place We had the spicy scallop roll and the salmon/avocado roll Both were amazing especially the salmon which was sensational From there we took a pause before the final round As we were watching the sushi chef he created an off-the menu steak tartare nigiri style with a cracked quail eggthe manager insisted we try it and it was fantastic Such a delightAfter some more time to digest we decided to go with the Yuzu Marinated Black Codthis was a first for me and OMG I am a huge fan Buttery melt in your mouth amazing fish We also ordered some rice and veggies on the side but the chef came over and advised us to a sampler instead especially so there was no gluten in the veggies Out comes a buffet of yummy items off the grillzucchini's with lemon tempura veggies (not GF though) and my oh my the asparagus This was all just fantastic We couldn't get out without a little GF cake and finally finally we rolled outta there after 3 and half hours of shear delight We will be back (probably sooner than they may want us too) as it was spectacular.
1322,This place is like candy land for auto services These guys really know what they are doing and their recommendations are worth listening to I came here to get tires stretched on my 18x95 wheels after not finding anyone that could do it near my neighborhood They made sure to take care of my wheels while I left them to install the tires and when I picked them up there was not a scratch on them I'm glad there is a shop like them that does what they do.
786,Poor service on weekends AND my to-go order was messed up  Will never come back here.
21,We all LOVE Thursdays with Debbie at the bar  She is a keeper.
984,Oh tacos Jalisco you are my everything Coming from a border town flooded with authentic Mexican food I set my standards pretty high for tacos and the likes Tacos Jalisco reassures me that I don't need to go back home for my fix These tacos are legit I recommend the al pastor cabeza and lingua So good I got my vegetarian girl friend to try one just because the smell of the to go box in my car was driving her crazyOh and the lady who took my order was a sweetheart as well.
4157,I stumbled across this place when I heard 'chile' for the name of this est Well to cut this short I am a spicy fave type of guy I didnt experience any 'CHILE let alone some black pepper for my black pepper chicken  Had i wanted some dry chicken calamari imposture whatever it was I wouldve payed for the real thing this est upset me and I threw it what they tried to feed me in the trash THIS PLACE WAS A DISSAPOINTMENT I WILL NEVER GO HERE AGAIN Even if they dared try to redeem what happened.
2689,My grandmother has a pool that she struggles to maintain all on her own so I took it upon myself to find a reputable pool service company that I could trust to take care of her pool  I found Aqua Shine Pool Services through friends who ensured me that they were 100% trustworthy and very reasonably priced as well  Right off the bat I have nothing but good to say about them they are always on time very respectful of the fact that my grandmother lives alone and send the same technician rather than different people every time  The pool was in really bad shape when they began servicing it and in two weeks it was able to be swam in again  The have always maintained more than just the water condition too If they notice leaks out of joints or caps on the pump they inspect it and either replace gaskets and o-rings or recommend service  I truly believe they know what they are doing and I have no doubts that they will continue to serve her honestly and thoroughly in the years to come.
4175,Don't waste your money or time Had worst experience here My order was wrong twice after waiting almost a half hour for two tacos Then when letting manager know he gave me attitude I don't pay to have someone insult my intelligence and doubt anyone else would I suggest going to Taco Bell.
3153,We stopped in before the movies across the street for a sake bomb and some sushi My side of the table was sticky eeewww And the sushi was very underwhelming the quality was not great especially for the price Even the miso soup was weird and frothy At least we didn't get food poisoning We will not return.
1182,"Food was ok waitress was a bitch and had us move after we say down to accommodate ""regulars"" Found employees to be in a rush food not up to par and just unaccomodating Never going back stunk."
3304,"My mother in law INSISTED on this place for dinner this weekend saying they had the best Mexican food she ever had :/We roll up and the hostesses didn't even greet us (there were 3 of them at the podium) They were rude and were too busy talking amongst themselves to even notice we were standing there I finally had to say hello to get noticed I wasn't happy about this They gave us a pager saying it would be around a 30 minute wait There were TONS of people sitting around waiting for seats We were called for our table about 30 minutes later By this time the front was getting crazy busy with people waiting for tables As we were seated we noticed of course all the people at the front waiting for a table-then we noticed all the empty tablesa serious WTF moment :/ There were at least FIVE empty tables just in our section alone So they were either purposely creating a wait OR were seriously understaffedOur waiter was nice but he seemed to be in a constant rush We ordered guacamole which is made at the table we received a bowl with large chunks of avocado which is NOT guacamole He just sliced it into a bowl and stirred it a minute with a seasoning packet and served it Again I was NOT a happy camper All four of our dishes came with ""spanish rice"" This ""rice"" was obviously a boxed mix with frozen peas The rice was hard to bite into and seemed out of place as it looked like a fried rice mix it was bizarreI ordered the chili rellano and the chilies seemed fresh and had good flavor but the rest of the meal was very bland My husband had the shrimp fajitas and he took two bites and REFUSED to eat anything else on his plateThis place makes cheap horrible food and charges $15/plate for boxed crap It's only attraction is that it's in a nice location and charges a fortune for everything which attracts people who don't know any better (like my mother in law) If you're one of those folks who thinks that just cause it's expensive that means it must be good then come running to this place-I'm sure they would be happy to take advantage of you If you actually have taste (and taste buds) go to Valle Luna or Los Olivos or for God's sake even Filiberto's would be better than this place Don't say you haven't been warned :/Too Long-Didn't Read version: bad overpriced food and service suck mmkay."
1486,I have eaten at this amazing restaurant many times I take all my out of town guests here and they love it as much as I do We found this place by accident but it was an awesome discovery Don't let the name fool you They are apparently known for their desserts I have only gotten the banana cream pie It is so good I cant resist but get it every time Between myself my husband and our guests no one has had a bad meal My favorite restaurant in north Scottsdale I promise you wont be disappointed.
1944,Great little frozen yogurt place The place was super clean and the staff very friendlyI got the raspberry-pomegranate which I highly recommend if you don't like flavors that are overly sweet There are tons of toppings that you can add including tons of freshly cut fruits and also the typical candy/nut topicsThe berries and kiwis go great with the raspberry-pomegranate.
2159,Great gluten free menu and they have kombuchaThe staff were super friendly and they were very accommodating to special requests (like my smoked salmon and scrambled egg with gluten-free toast).
1014,"I love Qdoba I go here every weekend have a Member card etc Many people think of this as the same thing as Chipotle they are very similar except I here they have a bit more choices I believe I used to go to Chipotle a lot but once I found this place this is all I ever go to Best thing about this place is the Queso Burrito Best thing on the menu Also when I ask for a side of rice they give me a nice cup of rice on the side for like 80 cents unlike Chipotle when I asked for a side of rice they give me this little ""shot glass"" sized plastic cup of rice and expect me to pay 135 or something like that Now I won't say that this place is authentic mexican food but hey it's good food I'm sure you can find some authentic mexican place if you want that but this place has its own menu and its own flavor Definately a place you should try out and see for yourselfI am a regular at the Rural Rd location and love the people there They are nice and friendly and since I always have a hard time deciding they give me some pushes in the right direction to get me to decide P The place is always clean and have never had a problem here."
1483,"I have stayed here since 1999 and I think it just gets better every time we come in to town Service is top notch the food is excellent and the rooms of course are beautiful with a great view Nice quality mattresses linens and amenities The service is comparable to the Beverly Hills Hotel An example is: we asked about a restaurant and they brought reviews to us and when we decided to dine there they made reservations and printed a map Everything was waiting in an envelope when we went to get our car for the evening We are treated so well weather we are in a smaller summer discount room or a suite in March for spring training The employees of The Royal Palms Inn will go out of there way to assist you to the best of their ability we did not hear ""no"" with out a very valid reason and they came up with alternatives I highly recommend this place to relax and be pampered."
2574,Fun authentic pizza gelato and panini palace with attitude Large variety of reasonably priced rustic roman pizzas They'll make what you want or you can follow their quirky selections like shrimp & salmon potato with Rosemary or hotdog I tried the artichokes & olives as well as the wild mushroom mix and I was amazed They make their own mozzarella fresh for the pies and fill cannolis to order You won't believe this level of freshness.
2369,Lucille's has great service and great food It's pricey thought about 50$ for 2 people w/ alcoholic drinks included But I think it's deffinetly worth it Check it out.
2258,I absolutely love Ace stores  It's a clean store they are very friendly helpful and usually have what I need  The one time they didn't they researched it (rare item didn't even find one for sale on the internet) and got back to me in a timely manner  They weren't able to find the item but they found a much more affordable alternative  :-)  That's worth 5 stars in my book.
2077,I have been  a client of Business Needs AZ for about five  years now Paul Demos is extremely knowledgeable and capable He has found tax deductions for me that I didn't know I qualified for I highly recommend him.
1291,Best place to go meet friends for happy hour just get there early so you can grab a seat outside they fill up fast.
4655,We walked in at 650pm on a weekday night and discovered that they close at 7pm Went immediately over to LUX It looked nice but without evening hours this place is giving away business Until they change their hours they will rarely get our business.
4040,Plain and simple this place sucks The food was disgusting and the waiter wasn't able to give me any details on what was on the menu This so called high end restaurant had some stuck up hostess and waitress I ordered a steak medium rare I was given a burnt piece of meat I ordered lobster bisque and was given sloppy with butter in my soup and it was the saltiest thing I've ever eaten This place can't do food or entertainment The entertainment was called Envy What a joke They can't sign but apparently every overly tanned person in Arizona think they are wonderful No accounting for taste If you go to Scottsdale take a pass on this placeits overpriced What they spent on pretty building they should have spent on training staff and getting an actual DJ Or and they should invest in a better chef.
1738,We love this place The service is great and the food even better We really like their Meet the Meat Calzone It's usually busy at dinner time and you could wait up to 40 minutes but it is worth it.
654,It's actually called 'La Piccola Cucina' and it is wonderful They have awesome food set up like a deli or you can order a panini The food is very fresh and they also have fantastic gelato- the only gelato counter I know of in DT Phoenix The atmosphere is so cool It feels like a mediterranean sidewalk cafe - umbrellas fountains flowers etc They are barely open a month so the hours will be expanding I know they are closed on Monday and they close all other nights at 8pm but the owner plans to stay open until midnight in the coming months The only downside right now is no beer or wine but the owner is working on that too.
846,The best  I had my 2008 Land Rover to the dealer for service a couple months ago and was told there were several things that needed to be fixed ASAP  With very low mileage on the vehicle I was skeptical  I looked up garages on Yelp and came across Dave's  He went over the car with a fine tooth comb and gave it a clean bill of health and didn't charge me a dime  He has a customer for life.
4391,"So I went yesterday with some friends for their 40th Anniversary They had good deals going on pretty much 50% off of a few dishes So I had ""Half Spaghetti With White Clam Sauce & Half Meat Sauce With A Meatball"" The pasta was $395 the Meatball was $375 they say they give you two but its really only one that they cut in half So to be honest even at Half price for the Pasta I felt like I paid to much Pasta was under cooked no flavor in the Meat Sauce the Clam Sauce was the worst I had took one bite sent it back I understand it was their Anniversary and they had half of food so they didn't put there all into it but it wasn't busy at all so the the food should have not been under cooked You would think knowing that people are gonna come you would want to entice them to come back It was my first and last time going here sad to say."
4231,"So many good reviews and coworkers highly recommendations made me go to this place I had my doubts but we try everything at least onceWe went on Saturday around 4pm the place was almost empty We got seated right away our server was ok and he did a pretty decent jobOn to the food: it was bland So very bland I was hoping I would've carried tabasco or something in my purse to add flavorThe bread that they keep bringing to your table that was the only thing good I had that day and that's why I gave it 1 starWe ordered the hummus as appetizer and it was ok nothing to write back homeI had the plate with chicken and filet mignon it wasn't good it was a $20 bucks dish I was really expecting something good the beef and chicken seem to be pre-boiled because the meat felt soggy kinda like a wet piece of bread it had a bit of charbroiled marks on them but it didn't had the flavor of the charbroiled it tasted so bland like I was eating boiled chicken and beef it was so chewy I only ate 2 bites of it and I was done I asked for the ""burned rice"" that was recommended it's some sort of crispy rice it was awful my jaw was hurting from chewing it and I was felling a tooth could breakMy husband had the kobideh and chicken combo with the regular yellow rice he also thought the chicken tasted odd like a boiled chicken no flavor the kobideh he liked at the beginning but then he said it just didn't taste good anymore could be because it was very cold there and the food got cold pretty quickly He did like the hummus however very muchFor my kid we order the chicken kebab it also came with rice - he ate it fine but I have a kid who never complains lol (lucky for me)And that was our meal our server was nice and the service was a little slow but not something will make me not go back however the food is making me close the chapter on Persian Room Everybody keeps saying that the portions are huge they are not they look huge because of the plate is served and the way is display on it but they aren't really huge they are normal size they do fill it with rice You also feel full pretty fast because of the bread and the rice so you may think it's a lot of food but it's more like a lot of starchThe place is a far drive overpriced tastes bland not need to say we won't be backIt has also a weird location in front of a hotel remained me of a Denny's Oh and by the time we were leaving the place was packed so I'm guessing overpricing food makes you think the food must be amazing well fortunately I know is not the caseOne thing to add we left a little hungry with our food boxed (then to the garbage) and with that little taste of the Persia we had we got a little sick so we actually had to stop in a store to use the restrooms :(."
43,So disappointing The most disappointing part was the service It was fine that they didn't have ribs but the cashier was deliberately unhelpful and unfriendly It turns out the ribs were about 15 minutes way from being finished Sure wish they would have mentioned that because we would have waited Then they failed to clarify whether we wanted a plate or sandwich When the brisket came out chopped up on a terrible soggy cold bun I was so bummed out Apparently I'm not the only one to have had this problem Right before I was about to send mine back another customer took hers back to the counter saying she had wanted a plate and not a sandwich They dumped the meat off the bun onto the plate threw away the bun and handed her back the plate GodThe coleslaw was watery the Mac and Cheese was dried out and the sauce was broken The waffle fries were fine I would have gone back to this place but the service was intolerable What a waste of a meal and money.
2371,Service and food were both amazing My family was in town from Idaho for the holidays and I took them there since it's a local brewery My mom loved it so much she said she would be fine going there every day Possibly the best wings any of us had ever had The burgers were Delish and cooked perfectly We also enjoyed the 80's playlist of music they had on Just moved in the area and will for sure become a regular Yum.
2262,Outstanding cheesesteaks  Nothing but good experiences here  While you may spend more than you planned for lunch the portions are quite large  Always a good choice.
1584,This isn't a fancy place but the food I had was delish  I had fish tacos because that is my favorite Mexican food to try at new eateries I was not disappointed  The prices are reasonable and the place was clean.
3334,Anyone who thinks this place has good gyros has not had a good gyro and I feel bad for them  Although getting a good gyro is really not an easy task  If you are ever in Seattle go to Mr Gyro's on Greenwood Ave and you will understand what a good gyro isThis gyro had meat tomato and onion  That is hardly how you make a gyro  Not to mention the Tzatziki sauce was awful  The pasta salad was okay  The lady taking the order -  how do I say this:  Not rude but almost there  Not friendly but not rude but not exactly chipper  This is the kicker:  I saw they had a gyro with pasta for 650 (special) so I ordered a gyro She asked me what side I wanted so I had her say what the choices were  She told me soup pasta salad fries and steamed veggies  So I chose the fries  She then told me the total was 10 dollars and change  I was likewhat  She repeated the total  Changing gears and clarifying it wasn't my hearing that was in question I asked for further details on why the price jumped 4 dollars with choosing fries instead of the pasta salad  She told me the pasta salad was on special  Still not believing this and that there must be more to it I then asked if the gyro's were the same size and she said yes  At this point I was tempted to just cancel the order based on the logic of this restaurant in charging 4 more dollars for a difference between choosing fries vs pastaand that the gyro was probably going to suck  Once again I paid for not listening to my intuition.
4288,"I'll most likely be the only 1 star review on here but I don't care  This place looks pretty on the outside but don't be fooled by the glitz and glam of this Biltmore Sushi place  Let me first start with my experience last night I wasn't terribly hungry but I thought I would meet up with some friends and I just ordered a simple Philly Roll  I'm not a big fan of smoked salmon (which comes standard in that roll) so I ask if I could have fresh salmon instead  Placed my order and the server comes back out and lets me know that there would be a $3 up-charge for fresh salmon  No thank you please cancel my order  1 minute later the food runner comes out and says ""Here's your roll with fresh salmon"" and I told her that I cancelled this order because of the up-charge which she responds back by saying they will send it back  Send it back you mean throw it away  Really  You're really not going to give it to me now you're going to send it back  So the food runner responds that she will ask her manager for permissionNeedless to say I recovered the roll at regular price but I couldn't believe there would be $3 up-charge for fresh salmon  Holy crap way to over charge for the most simple roll SecondDon't go in for lunchthis place has so many flies that you are constantly battling swatting flies away while trying to enjoy your overpriced-mediocre sushi roll  Hopefully with the weather getting cooler the problem has become better BUT never-the-less I just thought you should knowFrom the outside this place looks awesome-on the inside its modern decor will catch your attention-the sushi is not great but its ok-your bill overcharged."
2929,I love this place  I have been here quite a few times and this review is long overdue  Having been to Sichuan province I can say this is very authentic  To really appreciate  the true nature of the food you should be a spice fan  I am and the Water Boiled fish is my favorite meal  I also think the steamed dumplings in chili oil are some the best I have had with delicate wrapping and delicious filling  The Mao Po Tofu is quite good and my wife is a big fan of the Almond Chicken which is not spicy but very flavorful.
4478,"Boo on you I think Chipotle has just gone down hill You know what Chipotle feels like to me Pop culturethey coax you in with great deals giving you as much food as you want no complaints they have a ""it's all about the customer"" feelthey start to take over in popularity everyone loves them raves about them: they're healthy they use organic ingredients they are such big burritosbut then a shift starts to take placeemployees start to cut back on the good offers not all stores but some started to hesitate when you ask for more meat/beans they bang the spoon a few more times to get just a little more beans or meat offand then BAM You're getting charged close to $2 extra for 4 more pieces of meat The extra charge for meat isn't even listed on the menu (but they do list the extra charge for their sucky guacamole) In short they took a great idea watered it down inflated the prices and made their bottom line more important than customer satisfaction Piss on you Chipotle and everything like you."
492,"Do you know why there are zero stars checked  BECAUSE THIS PLACE IS NOT OPEN ON THE WEEKENDSMy life plan:  ""vacation"" studying at new and exciting coffee shops and bars with the BDF (best drink friend which is not the same as bast food friend) while we work on the weekends  Two times I tried to go her and two times I was denied  I thought the closure was temporary the first time I went  It was Historic Homes tour day so I thought the private event was the reason it was closed on a saturday  But this weekend low and behold I still could not go  Closed  Every weekend  No people in the old town componenet of Mesa -- which it too bad because it has a kickass yarn store and tons of potentialWill add stars if my impending weekday visit really knowcks my socks off  A penalty for th no weekend service will remain."
4302,I tried this place again and just as I thought It still hasn't updated it's taste in food at all It was like I was there the first time all over again I'm sorry to say but it's unenjoyable and gave me a tummy ache Ordered the volcano roll I think and it was torched It had a nasty gas burned flavor that wasnt good I don't appreciate that And I could see stack and stacks of already cooked tempura in the kitchen in the side It's cooked but not cooked fresh when you ordered It's a waste of money even though its cheap Won't be going here ever ever again.
3910,One of the worst hotels I stayed in anywhere  During my spring training visit earlier this year almost every day I had trouble with the door key cards  Very poor decor also.
780,A coworker and I stayed at the Courtyard Marriott across the street and got a recommendation for this place from the front desk We walked to Nabers and after our first meal we were hooked We went there for dinner for the next three night of our stay The wait staff is great and we even met the Nabers who were extremely gracious The food was awesome there wasn't a meal we didn't like My personal favorite was the Asian salad with Salmon While you're there also try the Naber's Pale Ale brewed by a friend of the owners I would highly recommend this place to those traveling in the area as well as locals How long until one opens up in Austin TX.
1563,No wifi Are you kidding me ur a cafe for god sakes Won't be going back until wifi is added.
855,"Hip hotel with very friendly staffLarge pool that I'm sure is packed during warmer months Be sure to request a room that doesn't face the pool to avoid the noise late into the night of people socializing in the hot tubTrader Vics restaurant home of the mai-tai- is affiliated with the hotel and they made us a dinner reservation to celebrate a special event Though the place was dead on a Friday night (seasonal resort) the joyful staff made up for the lack of vibe and the food was amazingThe spa and gym are way above average I had the gym all to myself one morning and they have new workout equipment to ""get it done"" It also faces the pool so you can stare off at the bikini bods while burning those mai-tais on the treadmillIt's also walking distance into old town Scottsdale and a 5 minute drive the the enormous Fashion Square mall."
3779,I really think I need to try this place again it was 15 stars I felt no tingly feels as it seems others haveThe wine by the glass was over priced we paid $20 for each large pour of good but not great wine And our server had NO CLUE about the wines A place like this should educate their serversbrussel sprout salad (3/5)- dressing was seriously lacking flavor would have been a 5/5 if the dressing was goodprime rib (2/5)- large cut very little flavor except for the crust the cut was too lean thus was not as tender or flavorful as it should have been we got two of these at the table both were the samedesert (1/5)- pecan gelato was flavorless- red velvet cake was flavorless and/or had too little actual cake 3x too much cream cheese filling.
2419,The best sandwich shop in AZ hands downIt's all in the bread Since they make their own bread on-site it makes your sandwich tasting experience so much better The aroma and that first bite into your sandwich cannot be put simply You will need to check a thesaurus to come up with better adjectives to express your experience hereThe italian focaccia and wheat bread are the best especially the focaccia I stand by the staple Dilly Club They don't short you on meatOther greats are the Blazing Buffalo Dilly Bird and the Vegetarian Special All terrific and delicious This is the kind of place that will have you coming back the same week.
2247,"After reading the other reviews I'm pretty much just seconding most of them  It really is like a Mediterranean Chipotle:  Pick your size pick your rice pick your veggies pick your meat pick more veggies pick your hummus pick your sauce  It's awesome very delicious everything fresh  Price is ""fair""  Not expensive not cheap  Just fair  My meal with a drink is like $10The owner/manager was also incredibly helpful in recommendations descriptions etc  Great guyEven had a couple of kids playing sax/guitar a few times if that's your thing."
2974,Bistro Classic pizza followed by a pizzookie (ahem pizza cookie)   The food is great (It's not down town chicago but so what) but the service is UNBELIEVABLY GOOD  I've been to the other locations and it seems I've had the best service here  They were SO nice to my 5 year old and that always goes a long way for a parent who's afraid his child will get bored and turn into a three headed dragon at that table  I's a comming back that is a fact.
939,Remember the Presidents of the United States Millions of peaches peaches for me millions of peaches peaches for free Well not exactly free but you get the point  Schnepf Farms annual peach festival is drawing to a close because the crop has been picked but I have one thing to tell you mark your calender for next year Around the second weekend in May Annual Peach Festival in Queen Creek They have hay rides peach pancake breakfast a peach bakery with all kinds of peachy goodness and peach jams jellies and salsas I actually purchased the raspberry and apricot jams in addition to 2 very large flats of peaches We were so excited when we got home We had tons of peachesThe whole experience was worth the heat sweat and dust of dirt not to mention the drive Take a drive through main Queen Creek and your whole experience will be fun and worth it.
2508,The worst thing about this place is that it's so far from my houseDefinitely my favorite Chinese place in the valley so far  Reasonably priced friendly people excellent food with which they are very generous  The orange chicken here is very good and very orangeyIt's one of those hole in the wall places that you wander in to by chance  Really small place with only three or four tables  So good that at least three people I know started delivering for them just so they could score a free meal every now and then.
1324,OMG Foodie heaven Michelin star good Just go.
4571,"I told my wife not to make me come here and she didn't listen  I waited forever for take out  They screwed up the order beyond belief  The staff doesn't know the ingredients in their own products  I waited 30+ minutes for them to fix an order that very explicitly said ""no cheese""  I brought home the wrong sandwich to my wife because they screwed up  One tiny container of sauce for a bucket of pasta  Disaster  Wife called back and the manager offered to remove just the sandwich  When she asked if that was really all they were going to do the manager said ""I don't know what else you want me to do"" Hmmmm  How about manage the restaurant teach employees the ingredients in your food and provide a certain level of customer service when you colossally screw up  I'm glad she finally realizes how much this place sucks because I've known it for years  Never again  One star is generous."
2617,Cool little spot Love the bar and the couches for lounging and enjoying a glass of vino Food is also really nice I love the beet salad with chicken There is something about the chicken always moist and flavorful Highly recommend.
4208,4 starsare you people kidding me Me thinks I cannot trust yelp any longer.
49,We have lived in Phoenix almost 8 years and been dying to try Bianco's but wait is always way too long  Recently went to newly opened location and got in within an hour only because we wanted to sit inside (heating up in the valley)  Seating is limited so once it gets really hot I suspect the wait might get a little longerOK the food: appetizer free because of the wait nice touch we had the anti-pasto which was not at all what we expected yet thouroughly delightful Fresh beets baby carrots cheese Sopprosetta and fennel - very flavorful  Pizza was good the crust is really what makes it great toppings were ok my daughter prefers traditional pepperoni and sausage to the local schreiners sausage and supressetta (don't know how to spell)  Flourless chocolate cake with vanilla bean cream was an excellent end to a great meal  This will probably not be a frequently visited restaurant due to the wait times but we will definately come back sooner than eight years.
4418,The gas at this station is not the problem here It's the Car Wash  My car was filthy due to the rainy days we'd had in the Phoenix area I drove my car to Tumbleweed to get gas as well as get a car wash After driving through I noticed several weird streaks on my car I tried to buff them out with a clean towel only to make it worse At first I thought maybe my car was so dirty that it needed a second wash About a week later I returned to this same station for gas and a wash Again with the weird streaks all over my car I have washed my car at this station over the last few years when it was a Valero and never had this issue Now I am absolutely convinced that the new owners do not maintain the chemicals for the Car Wash I paid for two Car Washes within two weeks $8  each  The Ultimate Car Wash What it was  was an Ultimate waste of money Do not wash your car here unless you want it to look worse than it did before.
3376,"What a come down I've been to the Daily Dose quite a few times and have always had a pretty good experience but not this last time Food was a mixed bag Our favorite Chorizo Mac and Cheese was great and the pretzels were good although we had to send them back because they did not come as requested with butter and salt My son's turkey burger was tasteless and dry I ordered one chorizo taco usually a fave which came cold Not just room temperature cold but cold like just out of the fridge cold The waitress was incredibly rude We made several requests for plates so that we could share the food which had already been served without success Finally I asked the waitress for plates and she replied ""The bus boy does that"" and walked away I complained to the manager who did respond very well pleasant and offering to comp the mac and cheese but the waitress spent the rest of the evening giving us dirty looks and avoiding our table What happened to professionalism It was my son's last meal in the US before leaving for overseas and he had been so looking forward to it What a disappointment."
4835,Food was poor Nachos were burnt Waited 50 minutes for check 1 star is generous Not sure but I think the ribs were coyote.
456,amazing haagon doz milkshake and awesome burgers i highly recommend this place.
271,I'd heard so much about Postino that I wasn't sure it would live up to the hype Happily it did The atmosphere the food and the wine all measure up at Postino the place that started the uber-urban renaissance at 40th and CampbellPostino is upscale but not pretentious The bruschetta really is out of this world but the salads are incredible too Went there for lunch on a Friday and loved the diversity of the crowd I also liked it that the noise level was reasonable even when the place was packed.
1862,Really great flavors This guy is a mix master- comes up with some neat combinations Try it- i'm not even a Snow Ball lover and I liked it So did hubby and niece   Inexpensive and large sizes too.
4143,Alright it hurts me to do this but after today Poncho's is dead to me I was a faithful customer for years as I grew up in the Laveen area I returned today excited for the same quality and feeling a little nostalgic Bleh It was incredibly loud and every table had a crying baby Don't get me wrong I love babies but every reasonable person has limits Also our waitress was awful I'm not usually too picky but she didnt once come by after our food was dropped off to ask how everything was She was morose made no effort to engage and everything we wanted we had to chase her down for And we arriveat the food The zucchini appetizer is off the menu big disappointment My beef tamale was awful I would have sent it back had my waitress ever returned My chicken enchilada was edible but tasted like one of those frozen entrees The salsa is still good but I'm not about to drive down to south Phoenix if everything else sucks Sorry Poncho's You used to be high on my list but you've really lost a lot of flavor and character since my last visit.
3281,"This place is worse than the IRS at least the IRS admits when they made a mistake But these arrogant workers will be caught dead before they hear themselves say ""sorry for the inconvenience"" or ""we made a mistake""  They gave me different information on two consecutive visits that I made then Dorrie some lady who obviously should not have been working that day because she was coughing phlegm all over my documents then after she asked me to wait by the counter for 10 minutes while their system updated I waited 1 hour and 30 minutes later I finally went to the information counter and asked for Dorrie I was told that she had gone to lunch 15 minutes ago and was told to go talk to another lady She just dismissed me and I went to go talk to the new lady who was also extremely rude and kept rolling her eyes and interrupting me before I could finish my sentences  Basically i spent total of 3 and a half hours waiting and getting attitude and nothing was resolved because of their mis information and Dorries idiot customer service ethics and the last ladys pride  not one person resolved anything and they all were too proud to say ""we apologize for the inconvenice""  I recommend this place if you wanna be late to work 2 or more hours and having your mild mannered patience tested to the maximum."
4020,Was not impressed at all I wouldn't call this a Gourmet Burger and they are expensive didn't like the way the meat tasted too salty and the french fries were ok we ordered the RosemaryOlive oil and Garlic fries my husband loves Burgers but we will not go back   this was the second time we had tried themI will say the Staff was Great too bad their Burgers are not Great We would rather go to In In Out or Five Guys  They have really Loud Music playing also which is not very pleasant my husband and I could barely hear each other talk .
258,I was on the hunt for a good croissant  Croissants are one of those things I find tricky  Most of them are terrible in these parts  I went to the bakery next to Federal Pizza owned by the Coes hoping to find a good one  The young man behind the counter told me that he believed the shop made them but he had only been working there for 2 weeks and hadn't seen any made in that time  I got on Yelp and since I didn't want to go out to Tempe to that apparently fabulous Essence Bakery I decided to go to French Grocery  I used to live around the corner from this place back in the day when it was a Circle K (hey that rhymed)  I used to scrape together $150 in quarters and walk there to pick up smokes  Yes back in the 80s cigarettes cost $150really  But I digressI went into French Grocery and it seemed pretty bare bones  The cheese case was tiny  Like you can get a better selection in the Safeway Deli Many of them weren't even French  But I was there for croissants  I was going to a friend's house for coffee and thought these would make a nice accompaniment to the brew  Wow  What a complete disappointment  I got 2 plain and two almond  The almond ones were hollow where they should have had almond paste  like the filling had melted out of them while baking  We were left with the merest hint of flavor  But the worst part  The croissant dough was just bad  Really bad  I've lived in 2 cities with large Vietnamese populations and they are known for their excellent bakeries  They were after all colonized by the French for a long time  Anyway I know my way around a great croissant and we didn't finish either kind  The plain were just wrong  Crusty like a biscuit not flaky and butterydense and very dry  It's almost as if they forgot to put the butter in the dough  The consistency was so unlike that of a real croissant they should take the French out of the name French Grocery  Quelle disappointment  I guess I'll have to continue my quest  Also they were way overpriced even for a great croissantBoo.
4628,Want to pretend to be healthyNow you can And ChopShop can helpHere's how:1) Order a kale caesar2) Throw in some delicious protein-packed shrimp Really the shrimp are excellent Skip the tofu3) Enjoy the full cup of caesar dressing that's suffocating the life out of each and every piece of kale and coating your mouth in a film best described as what every salad at the most mediocre chain restaurant in the world tastes like4) Delude yourself into thinking that a bowl of dressing flecked with green is good for youSeriously if you're going to down a thousand calories of salty fat just get a cheeseburger and fries and enjoy the hell out of it Never has ordering a salad made me want to skip dessert until now.
87,WOW~ I just had the best sushi for Lunch that I've ever eaten in AZI ordered the ASU roll although a bit expensive it was really good the Tempura Shrimp roll was one of the best I've had the shrimp was still warm it was so fresh and not only that but you get two pieces of shrimp inside  instead of just one The Tuna nigiri was also super tasty fresh the rice was perfect not too sticky (see pics)After eating all that I asked for a special order (not on the menu) of Tuna  avocado and cucumber rolled in sesame seeds Sushi chef whipped this up for me no problem and stuffed it generously (see pics) I don't remember the last time I saw rolls as full or as fresh as the ones I've eaten here todayMy only complaints are that the host/cashier station is in the center of the restaurant so there they are staring at your every bite(literally) the chopsticks are a bit bigger than normal and square shaped so I found them a bit awkward to use and although I sat at the sushi bar I had very little interaction with the sushi chef other than him handing me my plates the waiter took my order to him there was no piece of paper to mark my choices and hand in like I'm used toAnother thing is most of their rolls are topped with macadamia nuts so I ordered them without no biggie I guessDeliciously Fresh and very well stuffed rolls I could have easily spent $100 on my lunch by I stopped near $40.
2224,"This Costco location is unreal They had three people working the customer service counter and no one said boo to me for twenty minutes even though I was standing at an open register Then ""Pete"" comes up to say that he'll help the next return and that I'm in the wrong line for membership needs -- none of their lines are labeled and I was standing in the same line that people stand in at every other Costco for temporary cardsTwenty minutes later I was standing in line to cancel my executive membership These people killed my desire to make costco a regular shopping destination."
4794,This office is a joke  I scheduled an appointment was given a price after verifying my insurance and then when I was seen (a 7 min apt) I was charged 3x the price I was initially quoted with no reason why  They were rude and uncaring and I will never go back There are too many doctors in this area to be treated with such disregard.
3906,"I stopped here for fuel and a car wash on my way from the gym to work the other day  My car was in desperate need of a bath and I didn't have time to visit my favorite Cobblestone car wash in Scottsdale  Because I did not want to continue to drive in shame I figured a nice little rinse at the quick car wash would at least help a little  My car is black and was so dirty it was starting to look like it had a nice gray primer coat on itWhen the soapy cycle of the wash began I noticed something flying above my car  To my surprise I looked up and notice several pigeons riding back and forth on the car wash ""arm""  To their credit the pigeons looked quite happy going back and forthback and forth  I think one of them smiled at me (A side notewhere there are birds ready to poop they will find me somehow  I must have a poop magnet somewhere around me because it ALWAYS happens)I am already stuck in neutral and it's still in the soap phase of my wash  So I sit and wait  I count how long it takes before one of the birds craps on my freshly rinsed car  Of course within moments of the dryer beginning and the green light flashes I notice a nice little white pile on the hood of the car  To make things even more enjoyable the dryer smears the freshly deposited prize across my hood  After all who wants wet pigeon poop on their carMoral of the story peepsif you want pigeon poop and a car wash this is THE place to be  I was in a bit of a hurry so I didn't ask for my money back  However I did make a courtesy call later to kindly remind the owners of the gas station that they have some squeaky clean pigeons living in their car wash  They didn't seem thrilled with my sarcasm."
4411,"I bought some frozen Indian entrees from Sunflower Market and it reminded me of the time I ate here My boyfriend's parents were in town for Spring Break this year and I had been wanting to try this place out for quite some time so the four of us grabbed an early dinner after watching the A's beat the White SoxI should have known it was going to be a poor experience when we drove up and saw how ""fancy"" the outside was Our waiter was rude and when taking our order he dropped the (empty) tray once There were only a couple of other tables with people at them so it was pretty loud When our food came the waiter dropped my plate on the table and my food got all over the table my shirt and even my purse He brought me napkins a few minutes later so I could clean up his mess and dropped his empty tray yet again It took him forever to bring us the bill or extra Naan or anything we ordered Each time we waited I looked over at the bar and he was just standing around drumming his fingersThe food was very bland Even with a ton of heat/spice the blandness overpowered everything My boyfriend's mom is not picky at all but she could not eat her food The only reason I'd even give this place one star is the mango Lassi was delicious the naan was good and my boyfriend and his father really enjoyed their huge Taj Mahal's."
3246,I have went into Bashas 3X in the past week to find out about a promotion for a local event that they sponsor was in their add and they are to have a display in which to enter for free tickets/ and you can purchase () for free tickets NO ONE can tell me what the hell I need to purchase I got one manager was told to come back the next day to talk to the next manager (it was ONLY the 1st day of the ad and they did not have the info yet) Understood today trip 3 (the NEW ad came out yesterday still NO ONE can tell me a thing REALLY Buy Miller beer he tells me ok 6pk 12 pk He does not know Go figure I could have bought the stupid tickets for what I spent driving down there trying to find out what you should have been able to find out on day 2.
2548,When I was a kid my parents use to take us here to kill a few minutes of the day We were bored to death But wow has this place changed My kids love coming here and we spent hours exploring the dinosaurs gold panning and playing in the real jail cells (about the only thing I remember as a kid enjoying and they're still here) Highly recommended.
1462,One of my long-time favorites  Love the pork burrito.
439,Excellent food service and price   I was extremely pleased.
3501,"WORST RESTAURANT EVER  Mediocre atmosphere (at best) 1/4"" thick (at most) tv-dinner ""ribeye""  frozen corn probably frozen prepared potato and to say it had a tv-dinner flavor would be a compliment  We picked up McDonald's on the way home seriously."
2325,I want to start out saying that at one time I really liked kona grill I hadn't been there for awhile and unfortunately the quality just seems to have taken a dive We had the sweet and spicy shrimp appetizer The shrimp were soggy and I'd be inclined to call it candied soggy shrimp It was as though a jar of sugar had been poured over the dish The shrimp were also on crispy rice noodles that are normally edible These tasted like stale styrofoam Dish was indelible and thankfully they took it off our bill We also had the chicken lettuce wrapsextremely salty and also borderline I edible We chocked back some of the chicken since we were in a rush and were then afraid to try anything else Basically a lot of sugary and over salted processed food If I go back ill stick to the sashimi.
4335,This target SUCKS I went shopping spent over 400 bucks and some of my stuff was not in the bag when I got home had to come back waited well over 15 minutes to get my stuff back a rent a cop is taking for ever to approve me getting my stuff.
1257,Ohhh Hula's I've been here on one occasion so far and I can't wait to go back We went there on a Saturday night before heading out to our favorite club Sanctum which is really close There was no wait we were seated promptly and our very nice server got us our drinks right away The decor and ambiance was lovely- 50s tiki theme good music and low key peopleI really appreciate places with great fresh salads and tasty cocktails and Hula's delivered I order the spicy caesar salad with grilled shrimp and a Mai Tai It was SO GOOD The salad was a huge portion the ingredients were fresh and the shrimp was grilled to perfection The Mai Tai was great as well and it wasn't a typical girly Mai Tai It was strong and I had a great buzz going after drinking itOn Saturday nights we usually like to chill at the restaurant for a couple hours before heading out to the club where the music is really loud and we can't talk Hula's had no problem with this and we were able to sit there for a while and chat without being bothered to leaveI'm really surprised at the mediocre reviews this place has gotten because I had a great meal and was highly satisfied :).
2053,"College Times is not just for college kids (damn I'm sure the sales account executives aren't too thrilled that *my* liking it undermines their demographic targets but whatever) Granted the first few pages would be of more interest to students because there are pictures of local events and stories that a non-student wouldn't care about (eg transfers class credits courses the bar scene etc) HOWEVER setting all that aside the ""Calendar"" section is still more informative and chock-full events than the New Times (Yes I'm referring to the 'dead tree' paper edition of College Times) The 'dead tree' paper edition of New Times only lists one or two events per day The 'dead tree' paper edition of College Times by contrast lists more events per day So their event listings are better The 'dead tree' paper edition of College Times seems to have much better - not infinitely better but noticeably more comprehensive - music coverage In addition to featured new releases of the week there's a ""Weekly Six Pack"" sidebar of notable new releases and another sidebar for ""Download This"" suggested tracks to download Their reviews also have ""Similar Sounds"" below the review which seems to be like the ""RIYL"" (Recommended If You Like) tags you see elsewhere Frankly I've always found RIYL to be unnecessary If you can't tell what a band would sound like without someone having to give you an example you're either seriously musically illiterate or whoever wrote the review is seriously musically illiterateIt would be good if some of the features like ""Weekly Six Pack"" and ""Download This"" were available on the online edition."

177,AHHHH - I LOVE THIS PLACEWhenever someone goes to Phoenix I always tell them to hit up Culinary DropoutFood - Best Prime Rib Dip Sandwich in the US  Love it can't order anything elseDrinks - Marg on the rocks with a shot of Guinness Beer  Can't even thinking about having margs any other way any more.
3419,The girls that work there are too busy to chatting to say hi unlock fitting rooms or ring up customers I wanted to try on some shorts they didn't even look at me I didn't want to interrupt their very important conversation so I just took my business elsewhere.
1254,Libraries are a wonderful thing now if folks would just learn how to pronounce the word library -{)This library has such a good variety of books recorded too The video library is fairly good too I also love the option of ordering a book to be ready for you when you arrive The folks working there are consistently helpfulThe building it self normally would not catch my eye as I am not particularly drawn to the modern aesthetic Yet I find myself looking at the corners of the interior and its structure it is actually pretty coolThe parking too is quite easyWe are lucky to have such a place where cheap folk such as I can get a good book to read.
1676,My previous review says it all when it comes to the meal and atmosphere but it lacked an opinion on the dessert Well now I can add my opinion Their tiramisu is the best I've ever had and I've had a lot of tiramisu It's moist flavorful and amazing They also serve Nutella deserts cream puffs and more I've decided that dessert is a must here.
468,Very horrible experience just getting to and from the gameDespite leaving Peoria (18 miles away) an hour before gametime we were stuck in the traffic just trying to get off the freeway for this exit and with all the traffic didn't make it into our seats until the end of the second inning  (That's 80 minutes of travel in 18 minutes after 6 PM)  The cones they used to try and get us to the overflow dirt parking lot (NOT the center field lot this was down right field behind the Sox training fields) were trying to force too much traffic into too thin a lane and I ended up bouncing off a curb which showed many battle scars from cars in the pastAfter the game traffic was bad again but this time we were forced to take a right heading west on Camelback into the middle of nowhere with no signage or help to get back to the freeway  I may have an iPhone but I'd rather not have to try and get new directions while driving thank youOh and this was on a night of 3/4's capacityThe stadium itself is nice enough  There's not much shade in the day games and the grass berms in the outfield don't go up as high as in other newer parks  The grandstand seats are not sloped very highly though so if you sit behind a tall person you may have a lot of leaning to do to see the gameI would've given the stadium three-stars but the horrendous experience getting to the park and out make it a one  Save some time and money and go see some of the many other nice parks in Arizona.
4803,"this place is awfulout of the 4 chefs NONE of them were THAI strangely enough all the waitresses were Thaihad the spicy thai eggplant and papaya saladthai papaya salad is supposed to be very tart with a strong taste of limei think they forgot this key ingredient not even a hint of lime flavor although the green papaya was chopped nicelythai eggplant was ridonkulously BAD  i had 3 measly pieces of eggplant in my dish  the rest was overcooked meat and overcooked veggies  overcooked broccoli is the worst kind of loses it's nice green color and firm texturethe sauce for the thai eggplant wasn't quite right either and reminded me of the entree ""beef broccoli"" from a Chinese restaurantagain this place was BAD phuck phoenix dude i'm over it."
4378,"First time I've ever felt like a leper in a restaurant  I come to Scottsdale for business once a month  I was staying at the Hyatt Place across the parking lot and decided to go at about 7:00 on a Thursday to grab dinner on my own  When I got to the restaurant the front part was empty but the other side of the bar had people at some tables and at the bar  I was told by someone when I walked in to sit anywhere I liked  So I looked around and since I didn't want to sit at the bar I picked one of the three open 4-top tables available as there were no 2-tops open  And then I sat  About 8 minutes later after watching the waitresses walk past me a number of times one actually stopped and then proceeded to ask if I would move to the bar  She said that she had larger groups that would want the table  There was no one waiting for tables but she explained to me that a DJ would be starting in 10 minutes and it would get crowded  ""Lucky"" for me the two-top next to me was getting ready to leave so she said I could wait and just move to that table  In the meantime she did ask me if I wanted a drink  I asked about their bourbon selection but it was non-existent so I ordered a beer  She brought me a beer and then cleaned the table next to me so I moved  She then disappeared for five minutes before bringing me a menu  Once she brought me the menu it was another 10 minutes of waiting  I saw my waitress standing at the bar texting on her phone while the other waitress walked passed me four times  My waitress finally came back and took my orderThe food was very goodNo DJ ever came on and half way through my meal she sat two people at the four-top table next to me that she asked me to vacate  No on ever asked how my food was  When I was finished I sat there for a few minutes and then one waitress took my empty plate and the other brought me a check  I never asked for the check I actually thought I might have another beer but since it was obvious they weren't going to offer and just didn't seem to want me there I paid and leftJust to be clear I was wearing a relatively expensive suit looked very professional and find it hard to believe I was ""undesirable""  For some reason I was  I will NEVER return to this restaurant  I prefer to go someplace where I am made to feel comfortable welcome and wanted  It was very disappointing."
4964,dee-skusting  ate here once the food was horrible portions were microscopictry it if you don't believedon't tell me i didn't warn yousave your hard earned cash for another place and time.
3823,I Love Greek Salad my wife picked up a large Greek Salad for us to split and we were both very disappointed Our idea of a Greek Salad as opposed to others is mainly ample Feta Cheese and several Greek olives We each had an olive (like in 1 each) oh well The Feta seemed to be sprinkled from a salt shaker with half the holes plugged up The rest of the salad that is the normal parts was fine but the entire salad was somewhat small for a large We may be back but it won't be for the salad.
881,Love this place  If you cant find the candy that you want here it does not exist.
4240,Never will I go to this again There was NO organization We waited in our car for over 45min to park(should have left then) We then paid to park $5 Then it was $10 to get in We waited in line for 2hrs and moved 30 ft and still had 50ft to go We left at that point with out eating one thing DO NOT GO TO THIS EVENT NEXT TIME.
1200,Great food at good pricesExcellent service also.
1830,Freaking amazing A MUST tryI had the Prosciutto Wrapped Hawaiian Ono again AMAZING This place is awesome can't say enough great things about it The staff did an exceptional job Their $5 happy hour menu is a pretty good size with pretty good portions would recommend two if your creating a mealThe prices are good for the happy hour selection but the full meal menu prices are  a lil steep ($25-$35 couple items up to $40) compared to surrounding restaurants but well worth it I will definitely be visiting Roy's again as well as recommending it to others.
1739,I had a great time here very friendly people  great drinks  and the best spinach salad I have ever had  I had the chicken picatta ohhh man soooo good   Kudos to our waiter Ken for the great service and tips on the chardonay it was the perfect matchIve eaten there probably a dozen  times love the happy hour specials my fav is tuscan muscles the wine selection is outstanding the bartender AJ had us laughing for hours We really enjoy going there  great patio when the weather permits.
1295,Great service as soon as you walked into the door as well as when you leave The decor was very cute wooden beams and exposed steel for those who like contemporary (me) There were three of us and we each got the soup special of the day (salmon chowder) I was skeptical I like my salmon either smoked or sushi raw but this was delicious My the soup was served with a slice of foccacia breadWe split the beet salad and the pesto pizza The beet salad was refreshing The only thing i would do differently is have the goat cheese ball (served on the side of the salad) warmed up Nothing beats warm goat cheese The pesto pizza was great as well Had that nice brick-oven-taste to it (thin crust -not burnt not too thin) This would be a great place for a 1st date luncheon business lunch etc.
4788,"Went to Cadillac Ranch for the first time last night with a big group of friends (about 12 of us) for a birthday get-together We got there around 8pm and started ordering drinks and food The waitress was attentive so that's a plus but the food and drinks were not very good and they were very overpriced I ordered the nachos and what do they bring me A plate of small tostadas WTF Also they burnt the chicken they put on top of these tostadas Every bite was 50/50 between dry bland food and gross burnt flavor So then I ordered chicken strips and fries While the fries were pretty good the chicken was very bland and kind of chewy Now for the drinks the birthday girl had quite a few and I tried a bit of each Most of them were really tart and honestly hard to drink I had the big blue punch-bowl drink with the Red Bull in it and while it was a decent (3-star) drink there's no way in hell it's worth $14 Up until 10pm this place is a solid 2 stars However after 10pm they brought out a terrible DJ and cranked the music up so loud we couldn't hear each other anymore The music was terrible way too loud and it totally ruined the conversation we were all having Around this time about half of our group left The only reason we stayed is because a few people were still on their way so we tried to make the best of it and we stayed until 11:30pmThe comments from just about everyone in our 12 person group were ""Wow this place isn't very good is it"" or ""Where did our waitress go After 10pm they simply abandoned us over here didn't they""All in all great company at our table but this place sucks."
2332,Good authentic Vietnamese restaurant good service and great quality I'm in love with green papaya salad as long as seafood combination noodle soup yummy.
4119,"the folks in student financial aid  are the reason I don't attend this school they are clueless dishonest and dare I say hateful   If you have tons of money and need no advice then go here   If you ever  ever need help with paying for school then lol do as I was told ""scale back your lifestyle""   even the advisors know how horrible they are yet no one does a thingbefore leaving I went on Facebook to get info from other students about fin aid guess what they deleted it   LOL ummmmm ok."
3062,This was my first destination every morning for about 2 months straight in summer 2010  Sucker for the Pomagranite Pick Me Up the workers at this location are all nnice.
1743,I went here while on vacation visiting my friend Neither of us had been there before but I know they have lots of locations on the west coast so we gave it a try The staff was totally rude Before we went we called to check the hours The guy on the phone was patronizing and acted inconvenienced to have to give any information The pizza was blah - totally generic and nothing special If you're going to have mediocre food you better have exceptional service Double fail.
3662,I visited this store after purchasing the Groupon 4pack and my kids loved it so no complaints initially Until I came back and tried to redeem two Groupons on separate transactions which I was allowed to do on first visit I was told the owner decided you could only redeem one per visit which was not in the deal fine print This was unfortunate since I brought a whole pack of kids Left a bad taste in my mouth and we won't be going back in an effort to force repeat visits they lost customers.
4622,Simply AWFUL  It smells like a gym & the Beef & Broccoli was disgraceful  Also If you enjoy Lo Mein without a hint of flavor then this is the place for you  I want my money back.
4804,Horrible choice Unfortunate service hostility from staff after confirmed arrangements for a pick-up of car and a loss of property We stayed here on our wedding night for the convenience and seemingly chic accommodations-- would never recommend staying here Issued police report for theft and multiple letters against their service.
4490,I give up  I once loved the food and service here but both have deteriorated to the point of no return  At least my return  Once you get past the lackluster service you get mutter paneer with peas tasting like they just came out of a can and chicken tika masala so bland I didn't ask for cartons for the leftovers  Serving the tika masala at near room temperature didn't do it any favors  Go find Indian Paradise in the airpark while they don't have belly dancers they have cricket on the tv and truly terrific Indian food.
1635,Tried this a few weeks ago and ever since had a hankering to get back for more Only problem is their stupid hours Who closes at 7PM on the weekdays 2PM on saturday and isn't open on Sunday Guess when you're sitting on a gold mine you can do what you wantBurgers are big and sloppy and awesome That's really all there is to say Decor is kinda cool I posted pics if you want to see some Food is cheap and fast a big plus Its right off the Thomas and Central Lite Rail stop so if you're looking for good eats Lenny's is a good stop Only problem is the hours but hell if I was old Lenny I'd need some time for golf too.
3844,If I could give this zero stars I wouldThis was the worst experience I have ever had from a server  To begin with the busboy brought our silverware and menus out right away (A+)  Then it went downhill from hereWhen our server Aubrey finally did show up she asked us for our drink order and we told her were actually ready to order  This did not matter to Aubreyshe took our drink order and said she'd be back for our food order when she could write it down  Okayshe brought back our sodas and we order our burgers  Mine was ordered medium and my wife ordered hers well doneSome time later when the food arrived we asked for some sliced picklesthey never showed up until we asked the busboy to bring them to us I guess Aubrey was too busy helping everyone else to get our measly picklesNow I think well done has a universal meaning of cooked all the way through  Aubrey may have had the chance to fix this if she ever stopped back by to check on us but she did not  During this time we observed Aubrey checking on other patrons but we somehow escaped her attention  I was tempted to ask her what we did to upset her but she never came back to our tableWe finally flagged her down to get our check it took way too long to prepare  To give you an idea of how bad the service was the bill was $2482 I left $25I asked to speak to the manager and David came out and introduced himself as the owner and I explained to him what had happened  He introduced his wife to me and asked her to get me a gift card for the amount of my check  He was extremely apologetic about the service we receivedA few minutes later I was out the door with my gift card (which I did not want in the first place)My wife was waiting outside (that's how upset she was) and when I told her what had happened she took the gift card and was going to return it to him and let him know that's not what we wantedAs we were walking back in we spotted a homeless gentleman and offered the gift card to him as we had no intention of EVER returningMy wife went in to explain to the owners what she had done with the gift card and the homeless gentleman followed us in and was going to order some foodWe left and as we were pulling out the parking lot the homeless man informed us that David had taken the gift card away from him and told him it was not valid and that if he didn't leave he was going to call the policeWowreally  Unbelievablewe will never return and I sincerely hope anyone reading this will think twice before patronizing an establishment that treats people this way.
2215,There's a lot of Mexican options in Mesa but this one is one of the best I've found I used to go to Tia Rosa's but more often these days we hit up Senor Taco The portions are huge and value priced and they have a great salsa bar I usually get the Special 
2734,This is my favorite lunch spot in AZI don't care if its a 115 outside i still go in and dominate the phoits the best pho i've had and the staff is great.
3928,"Totally excited to try this place out my grandparents my mom and I (4 of us) came here for some Korean food It wasn't too busy just pairs of people from nearby offices coming in and out Unlike other Korean restaurants their lunch special selection is very limited Special A  consists of a sushi roll with a soda special B = teriyaki beef/chicken (no soda) or special C Korean BBQ Spicy Chicken As we were looking at the ""lunch special"" board the lady behind the counter insisted that we should look at their full price menu instead Here comes the awkward part: she then asked my mom ""are you Chinese"" Even though she is my mum looked at me all puzzled as in ""what does that mean"" The lady proceeded by pointing at the ""seafood pancake"" section on the menu and saying ""I don't know why but you Chinese like this pancake a lot"" Good thing my mom didn't hear what she said or else So we got the Spicy Chicken lunch special ($699) a bulgogi ($699) and a beef yakisoba ($719) The cool thing about this place is that it has a mini ""kimchi"" buffet bar with trays of marinated tofu potato bean sprout kimchi broccoli and some other vegetables It also has this delicious house special hot sauce By the time we finished a dish of kimchi the food came so it didn't take long The spicy chicken came in a bowl about the size of an instant-noodle bowl (but slightly deeper) was tender with rice underneath it The chicken was definitely marinated well however the last couple of pieces had tendons and big chunks of fat what a bad way to end it The bulgogi also came in a bowl with rice underneath The beef was definitely not marinated fully The color was super light and the beef was close to tasteless The biggest disappointment food-wise was the beef yakisoba The noodles occupying most of the Styrofoam lunch box were sweet Then there was an ice-cream scoop of rice topped with 3 pieces I kid you not THREE pieces of dog-tag-sized super-dry meat In the end we just decided to bring the barely-touched yakisoba home for my younger brother (well teenage boys tend to eat everything) While my mom transfered the noodles to the plastic bowl (since the Styrofoam box was lidless) I went to ask for a plastic cover This is the best part: the same lady stared at me pointed at the salad bar and said ""you can't take that home"" I thought there was a miscommunication so I asked again for a lid for the noodles Again she pointed at the salad bar and said ""you are not allowed to take the kimchi home"" Wow seriously Just b/c my grandparents are Chinese you assumed we were stashing kimchi in a bowl and trying to sneak it out ""Look I just want to take my noodles home ok"" She hesitantly gave me a lid""Hey hey you we chineness peple no steal kimchi becuz Confucius say 'no stealing kimchi'"" only if I said that to her faceOh and when we got home my brother aka our food dumpster took a bite of the yakisoba and never touched it again  Conclusion: If you want amazing Korean food and friendly customer service please just go to Chodang Chodang is WAYYY BETTER hands down."
2861,My family and I have been here 2 or 3 times and each time it's been great  We found it on accident and oh what a fortunate accident  Their homemade salsa is fantastic very garlicky which I love  The pico de gallo is fantastic  Bananas Ranas needs to take a note from this place (they serve Pace wtf)We're working our way through the menu  We took a visiting friend to this restaurant with us last time and he was very glad we did loved dinner.
743,I went to this place because I had purchased a Groupon deal that included x-rays a cleaning and teeth whitening  After an hour and fifteen minutes there I am with x-rays a dental hygienist telling me I need to floss and no cleaning  I expected the whitening to happen on a different visit but not even a cleaning After over an hour.
1464,Early on a hot Saturday morning we headed to Baker Nursery to find new plants for our landscaping adventure What a lovely nursery It was well organized with plenty of shade so you didn't have to wander the aisles with the sun blazing down All the plants looked so healthy and beautiful My husband and I are both pretty uneducated when it comes to plants We had so many questions and there was always someone there to tell us about the plant what kind of soil sunlight and water it needed etc I wanted a particular cactus that our neighbors have in the front of their house but I didn't know it's name so we played a kind of Pictionary meets Pantomime in describing it  It took about 10 seconds for the gentleman to understand what I was talking about pointed us in the right direction and picked the healthiest of the bunch We loved the personal attention and we were grateful to all the people who helped schlep the plants up to the front for us and load them in our vehicle using plastic to make sure the dirt didn't dirty the car  Two weeks later and all our plants are thriving Whether you're a seasoned gardener or newbie to the plant world your time won't be wasted at Baker Nursery and you'll get the best of the best in terms of plants and service.

1284,I fell in love with Chopstick's about a year ago The food is awesome and the staff is wonderful too They are very friendly clean and well priced Plus they don't use MSG and they have an entire vegetarian menu including tofu options awesome.
90,Saturday evening 02 September we returned to FnB for the second time in a week - this time with friends along  We had appetizers entrees and deserts - swapped food all around and had one of the best meals that we've had all year  Reservation was ready when we arrived the staff was pleasantly attentive  This locally owned restaurant deserves all the rave reviews that it has garnered in the past 25 years  A must try if visiting Scottsdale  We're lucky - we live here and we know enough to call head for a reservation.
1232,If you live in AZ or just visiting you have to go to the House of TricksIn an old house surrounded by  lots of trees and  is in a house and has an amazing patio and bar outside Food is amazing and service is great This is a great restaurant for a date or a special occasion The setting is amazing  and so wonderful I have recommended this place already to numberous people I will definitley go back.
4500,The rude front desk staff is enough to make me not ever come back again The older receptionist actually followed me back to my chair to argue with me after we came to an agreement and I smiled said thank you and walked back to where I was sitting She stood over me and proceeded to argue her point which was that she can be more than 15 minutes late with my appointment but I can't be more than 9 Oh yeah she forgot to mention she had two other wax technicians in the back not currently doing anything That location is a franchise and the owner was supposed to call me back months ago regarding the altercation Needless to say my business is gone for good.
561,Went to the salon at the beauty institute for a hair cut yesterday and loved it I don't even think that supercuts can beat this price ($9 for a woman's wash cut and dry) but the environment is that of a place I would pay $30-40 for a cut The student who cut my hair did a great job and her supervisor came to check up periodically Both were wonderful I will definitely go back.
3627,I went here on satuday the 19th I went to purchase a lap top and was ready to buy that day As I was lookin at the different computer the employees we walkin around askin everyone if they needed help everyone but me that is As all the customers we helped and left I was there for 20 minutes with out even being acknowlaged as the workers stood there having a personal conversation This blatent dissregard of my presence caused me to leave with out anything Best buy will no longer have me as a customer and I will buy my electronics else where.
2329,In my quest for really good coffee shops I look for 5 things and each get a star if they're up to par 1 Fresh coffee 2 breakfast 3 unique atmosphere 4 comfort 5 ambient music Press has it all.
2951,"I love love love this place  It's been around for 10 years  Just down the street from me and for some reason I just never got around to going  Finally in November my mom and I went for dinner  AmazingI'm a convert  I'll be a Coup Des Tartes for special occasions and just for fun  The food was wonderful  Recognizable with a twist  Fresh ingredients and really nice service  This little place has more character in its little pinky that so many other restaurants in the Valley  From the pictures on the walls and photographs on the fireplace to the staff  I took my boyfriend for a romantic date night the weekend before Christmas and it was great  He said the same thing I'd been thinking ""WHY haven't we been coming here for years""I think I thought that it was much more expensive than it was  Mom and I had one app one salad and two entrees for $80 (including tax and corkage) and BF and I had one app one salad two entrees one dessert and two corking fees for $121 (including tax and corkage)  No bad folks  Pretty darn good actually  It's BYOB so we had wine that would have cost us over $150 in a restaurant but we brought it from home  I love itStandouts for me were the mushroom & Gruyere tarte lovely and cheesy and flaky all at the same time  The lox and potato appetizer was fabulous and I'm not a big lox fan and I loved this  The baby arugula salad with pears feta and candied pecans was a perfect balance of flavors and textures  The lamb entree is good and surprisingly I tried the chicken cordon bleu and it was terrific  Most amazing though is the Grand Canyon dessert -- layers and layers of chocolate and peanut butter mousse  Light and fluffy and rich and decadentBon Appetit."
1277,This is just simple solid delish food One good way to tell a great lunchtime sandwich place is if the parking lot has cop and fire vehicles in it (This place is actually right across from a fire station so those guys have it easy) It's not uncommon to also see several UPS trucks plumbers trades folks and all other walks of life The product is so loaded up and fat that it's almost hard to eat This is a good problem to have Easily the best sandwich place in the Tukes and the greater I-10 n Ray part of the valley for that matter Nondescript yet comfortable semi hidden little suite next to a trophy and insurance business The menu features 24 sandwich combos on their signature soft chewy rolls They serve mostly just Sammy's but chili is great too  Sorry I rushed this review but no matter If you're in the area and hungry for a sandwich just head over I doubt you'll be disappointed.
981,Horrible pizza place Pizza is gross and the service is equally as bad I called for a large pizza and was told it was $499 I asked for half pepperoni and half bacon When I went to pick up my order they charged me an extra $250 for splitting the toppings Would have been nice if they told me that when I called to place the order especially when I specifically asked for the price I asked to change my order since I wasn't warned about the extra price and I was told NO Never going back.
1160,"We had dinner reservations for our anniversary on a Sunday at 7:15pm  We arrived about 10 minutes early and we were seated immediately with our choice of booth or table  The waitress (a younger girl) was very nice and patient while we decided on drinks and dinner  She kindly answered all of my questions about the menu and was polite when I still needed another minute to decide  I ordered the Farmer's Daughter Drink and it was delicious  (It comes in a martini glass)  At first the waitress' assistant was refilling out water and soda every few minutes (not anywhere near empty even) then by the end of dinner we were waiting for more water  Not a ding on the restaurant just weirdFor dinner my husband got the bone in rib-eye medium rare it was cooked perfectly  I ordered the Sunday Prime Rib dinner that came with a 12 oz prime rib with au jus horseradish sauce and the peppercorn sauce - (I also requested some bearnaise sauce no charge) a salad choice of any full sized side dish and a full size dessert all for $3895  I chose the Fleming's potatoes and chocolate lava cake  The potatoes were good but basically just scalloped potatoes with a hint of jalapeno in them  The lava cake was delicious soft and gooey  My husband ordered the chipotle mac & cheese which was very good better than the potatoes in our opinion I just hate spending $950 on mac and cheese  At the end of our meal the waitress brought a ""gift from the chef"" for our anniversary which was a box of 4 large truffles and a $25 gift card good on your next visit in the dining room only at this location only."
2700,This place was amazing I was traveling home from San Francisco and a traveler I met suggested this place to me because it was their favorite Thai place I went the night I got back into town and it did not disappoint Very tasty with a great portion Staff was very helpful and accommodating I got massaman curry and it was delicious.
4311,"I chose this motel because it is 3 blocks from downtown I wanted to be able to walk back and fourth for a couple days Upon check in I was greeted with zero smiles and made to feel more like he was doing me a huge favor The older gentlemen with white hair was very very clear that this was not a ""party"" motel And that we will get removed immediately if there was even 1 complaint I found this interesting since I am a mellow 45 year old who does not appear to be a partier in the least bit He then went over the no smoking policy and that we'd be charged $15000 cleaning deposit if we smoked Even though the office smelled of cigarette smoke LoL  And nobody in my family smokes I simply smiled and looked at my wife and said ""Well looks like we came to the right place honey""'I was utterly disgusted at the layer of filth on the outside of the building I wiped my finger on the outside windowsill and it turned black Old gum some kind of splash stains trash all in view on the way to the room  Every outside plastic trash can within view was barely holding together like they had been run over and stood back up They are cracked to death and appear to be very old as they are faded One of our rooms (we have older kids with us) reeked of cigarette smoke as we entered I immediately opened the door and cranked the fan to try and air it out I noticed the batteries were missing in the smoke alarm I went to the office to report this and was met with apathy from now a female attendant She told me she could swap out a room and would call me in 20 minutes I told her that I did not want to get charged with a smoking violation We went back and hung out in our other room DISGUSTING The corners of the rooms floors are filled with lint dust and food particles where it looks to never to have been vacuumed  Stains on the carpet and chair seating area There were small chunks of seat cushion under the chair in the corner as if had not been moved or cleaned under in a long time  When I looked behind the tv cabinet in search for an outlet I saw a former tenants Old Spice deodorant covered in dust along with numerous crumpled kleenex Seriously  After walking around the room in my socks for about 30 minutes they were black on the bottom Gross I can only guess that the cleaning crew blows through each room doing the least amount of work they can We found evidence that one of our beds sheets had not been changed After an hour I had never received a phone call that was promised I went back to the front office for some coffee The same lady was there and I told her to forget changing our room And that it had aired out pretty good I actually just gave up and decided to just try and help my family enjoy our few days here After dealing with the manager who was very clear that we were here for them and the condition of the room I knew trying to get them to see reality would be more frustrating that just letting it go  So I did I figured I'd inform possible customers of what they might be getting into And I honestly hope Super 8 contacts the management here and tries to fix these easily remedied issues Later that night after two of my kids showered their tub (in room 108 the stinking smoke room that still stunk) did not drain I walked back to the front office and met the lady again She told me that they only had 1 plunger and that they had given it to another room and that they were asleep already I now asked for a new room She told me she would see what she could do and that she would let me know and call me back at my room I never heard back from them the entire stay Not to see if we were ok Not to offer to replace the missing batteries (code violation)  The next morning we tried to enjoy the free breakfast Ok at least they are trying I guess But when the OJ ran out the white haired guy fixed it but did not say a word to us as we said thank you He really makes it clear that he just does not enjoy people We will never stay her again And I feel like we should get a partial refund I understand things happen But this place is a joke I would be embarrassed to work here And I refuse to believe management doesn't know what is going on Just hard to believe people can just not careUPDATED JANUARY 26TH    After returning home 3 outta4 of my kids developed little red bites along the backs of their necks on their sides and on our 2 yr old under his diaper on his belly We determined that they were in fact bed bug bites  Fortunitely they did not make it back to our house They did end up going away and have not returned since."
4923,"I waited 20 mins for my food  I approached the counter and they forgot to put my order in The managers response was ""I don't know what happened"" I'm never going back."
3537,"NEVER AGAIN  Getting ready for a road trip to California I decided to skip going to my regular mechanic and hit up Jiffy Lube - I even had a coupon  I am normally pretty tough when it comes to all the add-ons they try to sell you I'll replace my own air filter thank you very much  However this time they got me on the radiator flush  I figured it was summer we were driving through desert - better than having the car overheat right  WRONG  A bunch of monkeys with tools and hopped up on crack couldn't have been worse for my car  As I was leaving for work the next morning the car immediately overheated something it had NEVER done   I went right back to Jiffy Lube who gave me some line about it not being topped off  They never actually checked anything - they just patted my pretty little head and sent my on my way  I guess it's my fault for being an uppity female who wants to driveany way a block away the car temp started climbing again  So I went to a DIFFERENT Jiffy Lube hoping it was just the staff at the one by me  They also said that it wasn't their fault blah blah  Again I was treated like a moron because I am a girl  Finally one of the staff members working there risking their own job gave me the number of the regional franchise owner  But my car was still overheating  I gave up called my regular mechanic who sent a tow truck out Jiffy Lube cracked my radiator with their ""flush"" service  So $300 later I had a new radiator and a burning desire for revenge on Jiffy Lube  I suggest the only way you go to ANY Jiffy Lube is if you are taking your arch enemy's car or extremely masochistic."
2490,"I recently got married on 05/04/2013 I had planned my wedding for a little over a year and felt very ""ahead of the game"" and organized I had picked out everything lined up all of the vendors and was sure that I was prepared and ready to go Then out of no where 30 days before the wedding chaos set in I realized about five weeks out that I was not where I needed to be and that with work it was extremely difficult to finish all of the final details The last thirty days truly are what make the wedding or event what they are I began research for a wedding planner My fianc√© was very much against the idea He felt that all of our family members grandparents and aunts would be perfect for the task of setting up and breaking down the wedding Thank God I found Sip and Twirl I contacted Laurie explaining that I needed some serious help Who was going to handle the vendors day of who was going to set up all of our favors and goodies and decor who was going to get us in line and ready for the rehearsal who collects the gifts and sentimental artifacts at the end Within minutes of emailing Laurie I got all the reassurance I needed She responded and was so kind and very clear about how they could help me She asked me to give her all information in regards to the wedding so I slowly gathered my huge list and handed it all over to her She was so sincere professional and easy to talk with I then was introduced to Caily who became my go to girl She is AMAZING I met with her and Laurie to discuss final details and without a hitch I gave them complete control of everything That was the best moment of my entire wedding planning Caily eased all of my concerns confirmed all of my vendor information two days prior and made certain modifications of things I didn't even think of Caily is so sweet  and willing to help with anything AT ALL She truly made my day magical  All of the loose ends and details I hadn't even thought of came together like a dream and it is only because of her These ladies are beyond good at what they do they have an eye for events I truly for the first time in the planning experience had nothing to think about The rehearsal went so smooth and our families were given great instruction on where to be and when (which was SO needed) The day of I got to relax and forget about the details When I arrived at the venue I was blown away with how beautiful everything looked and how smooth everything was going We received countless praises from all of our guests about what an amazing night they had That is the best complement to any bride and groom I could ramble on for days to tell you what a duo these two are but you need to see for yourself They are affordable reliable hard working and AMAZING We have amazing memories from this day and none of it would have been possible without Laurie and Caily I am going to miss them Molly."
4723,I'm in town for a convention and decided to grab a Sub to take back to the hotel room  This Subway has a great location in the Arizona Center  It was not very busy  The staff was friendly and neat I was disappointed when I got back to the room to eat only to discover that the bread either old or left in the microwave to long.
3549,Nothing seemed to go right here  The valet parking was a total disaster  When we were seated we walked all of the restaurant with the hostess not knowing where to seat us  Sat for a while before a server ever came over but I have a feeling that stemmed back to the seating issue  Food was OK but nothing to pull up the score.
357,I came in today to ship some packages because the post office was a mad house  It was busy for a kinko's but I was helped promptly and efficiently  I get a discount with my company to ship things here so it is a great alternative to waiting in line at the post office  I have also used this location to fax and it was fast and simple to do.
3819,OVERRATED OVERRATED OVERRATEDThey've done a bang-up job of public relations and convincing the trendy sheep that this is the equivalent of a pizza orgasm Hmph It's OK not great but it's not like there aren't other wood-fired pizza joints in PhoenixBy the way I know real Italian pizza I eat it regularly In Italy So don't give me crap about 'go eat at Domino's you don't know good pizza' I do Believe me I cook Italian (tuscan) regularlyPizzeria Bianco approaches traditional Italian pizza so I'd ordinarily give it 3 stars However I downgraded it to one due to the rude rude rude service and how incredibly overpriced it isGotta hand it to Bianco though he's got a good scam going I mean he's really got it figured out Hype the shit out of the place bribe/suck up to all the restaurant reviewers who convince the sheeple that you gotta go here if you're 'somebody' brown-nose the local celebrity crowd into coming there (I'm sure they get treated much differently than us peons) make the restaurant too small and get people to spend money at your wine bar while enduring the insane wait for a table Fucking brilliant.
4601,"I am writing this review after submitting 2 emails to the European Wax center with no response  I sent one on Sept 29 directly to GuestServices@waxcentercom and another to the ""contact us"" section on their website on Oct 13  I still have received no response  I am giving 1 Star only because of the lack of customer service  So now I am posting my exact letters that I sent to their customer service departments because I am extremely upset with their customer service""I wanted to let you know of a bad experience I had yesterday Friday September 28th at the Camelback location in Arizona  I had an appointment at 1145 for Brazilian Bikini Wax   I had purchased the pack of 12 waxes from another location but have used the majority of them at the Camelback location since I work close to there  For the past year I have mostly gone to the same wax person I cant remember her name I think Lisa but she was from NJ and just recently left the location because she moved  She was wonderful  After each wax she made sure she wiped the whole area down tweezed any missed hairs and applied the ingrown hair solution before I left  She also gave me a mirror to check and make sure that I was ok with itYesterday I was given a new wax person (new to me)   I am not sure of  her name either - but I am sure you can look up my appointment in the computer  She had brown hair and a full arm of tattoos   While she was very nice and did make me feel comfortable the wax was not a good wax at all  I told her that the wax was extremely hot and she said I was actually the 2nd person of the say to mention that and she thought it was weird because the wax was cooler than normal  She completed the wax and just put on baby powder and sent me on my way  When I got home I noticed that my underwear was stuck to me - because there was still wax left  And not just a few spot - a decent amount  As I was washing it off - I noticed that there were still hairs all over  She hadn't plucked any of the hairs that didn't come out with the waxing  And I was already getting little red bumps as she did not apply the serum and left wax on  I immediately applied the serum that I purchase from your company and have applied 3 times since yesterdayOne issue was at check out  I asked for a full bikini instead of a Brazilian yesterday  Normally when I go to the other locations they credit my account the $7 since I paid for the package of Brazilian and only used a bikini  Then I am able to use that $7 for other waxing services  I was told yesterday that this location cannot do that  I don't understand how certain locations can and certain locations cannot  I then asked if they can apply the $7 that I did not use right then to a lip wax and I would pay the rest - they said noToday I have at least 10 big red bumps and no smooth ""just waxed"" feeling at all  It feels as if I was there almost a week ago  I am extremely unhappy with the service that this employee gave me and felt that you should know  I have 2 Brazillian waxes left on my package and they asked me if I wanted to renew and buy another 12  I did not do so and seriously have to consider whether or not I am going to""Especially after no response to either letter that I sent in I am extremely disappointed in this company  I would most certainly not recommend going to the Camelback location as I feel the staff has declined there."

4569,Service and food suck balls.
3354,For the past 5 years we have been going there every single Friday but NO MORE We were mistreated and yelled at by THE OWNER She was stressed and overwhelmed  with COSTUMERS instead of happy to have business She couldn't keep track of the amount of ice cream cone she had served and decided it was better to scream at her clients for her mistakes and negligence All this misbehaving on her part was done in front of children and new trainees NICE We will GLADLY take our business somewhere else where they do appreciate loyal customers and decent families.
4660,This place had a lot of hypeone of the best rated restaurants in town We were extremely disappointed The service was terrible we sat for about 15 minutes before we even had a menu and were asked if we wanted a drink When we did finally get the menus we were extremely disappointed with what was supposed to be an extensive wine list The wine list turned out to be rather weak with a small selection from each region - even France wasn't well represented After another 15 minutes of waiting without any contact from the non existent server we walked outand walked down the road to Chelseaswhich was solid.

4439,"This USED to be my favorite restaurant I've introduced my mom my boyfriend a few friends and cousins to this place because I am absolutely in love with the Mediterranean Wrap with cashew cheese Yum And the salad that you can order with it delicious After my meal I would usually order the vegan Tiramisu which by the way also delicious Never had a bad experience Today after shopping I decided to stop by to get a table I was mainly going for the Tiramisu and some almond chai I came in and stood there for a while a few people were behind the counter nobody acknowledged me I finally approached the guy by the cash register and asked him if they had the Tiramisu he just said ""If you don't see it then we don't have it"" I looked some more didn't see it I then asked if he maybe knew when they would have it he just said ""No I don't know"" And I continued standing there he just then walked away How awkward and so rude I can't say I am mad or angry I am just EXTREMELY sad and disappointed because I have introduced so many people to this restaurant and have always educated people the benefits of eating there and I felt so shut down I mean even if they didn't have the Tiramisu (which is fine) I would have still loved a table for some drinks and maybe another dessert Ugh I cannot believe I let this guy ruin my experience despite how much I love the food the value of the food and the ethics behind the food I am just too embarrassed to go back and I just don't feel comfortable Am so sad and disappointed this was my FAVORITE restaurant :'-(."
488,I've belonged to Costco since it was called Price Club This branch is my favorite store in the valley I couldn't live without the cheese bagels I buy gas from here exclusively because it's cheaper than anywhere else  The membership pays for itself and I have a free American Express card They recently put the slides of my childhood on DVD and did a beautiful job I love to walk the aisles and see what's on display: cookware dishes jewelry auto accessories baked goods wine fruit books clothes The holiday treats are better here than at any store in the valley  My favorites are  the chocolates of the world and the chocolate macadamia nuts  What makes this store so great are the people who work here I've been to several different stores but this one has the friendliest staff.

4270,"Ok first off I have been a long time and I mean long time customer of Verizon Wireless I'm talkin 15 years So a friend of mine tells me on June 27th that I need to use my upgrade by tomorrow (June 28th) in order to renew my current contract and retain my unlimited data package I called Verizon's customer service that day the 27th and asked them if that was necessary and they told me no that it wasn't necessary for me to upgrade right then and that  my current plan wouldn't change at all Specifically my unlimited data plan In an effort to cover all my bases I had my husband call and confirm this also They told him the same thing that nothing would change and that we did not need to upgrade until we wanted to So fast forward to today June 20th I go into the Verizon store in Chandler on Frye road The salesman tells me that upon upgrading I will need to decide on which new plan I would like to move to I'm like what I explained to him that I spoke with a Verizon representative back in June who assured me that I would not loose my current unlimited plan when I upgraded and signed the new 2 year contract He told me and these were his words ""Well the lied to you"" WTH I was majorly p'd off I told him that I would not be upgrading anything until I called into the Verizon's customer service department to get this all worked out So I go home and we call and we get the same ol rigamarol from Terrence the Verizon rep Blah blah blah can I please speak to your manager 15 minutes later (yes I was on hold for 15 minutes) Alisha the so called manager gets on the phone She apologizes not in a nice way and says those plans are no longer available and that she can't help us She says the reps did not know that the plans would no longer be available when we called in to ask the question I call BS on that I called one day before the new ""plans"" rolled out You seriously ganna tell me that  the Verizon reps were left in the dark on that one I think not Long story short she gets mad at me for saying that the Verizon rep and that Verizon itself are liars and hangs up on me I am now going to shop around and look for another cell service provider I feel I have been lied to and that they don't give a damn about their customers I refuse to pay anyone for that kind of service Good luck to all of you who have not upgraded yet."
2363,The main reason we seek out Hot Dog on a Stick is forthe lemonade  It's perfectly sweetened and refreshing on a hot day  While we tend to go for the regular lemonade we have also tried the cherry lemonade  And you know what  It's all good  I wish Hot Dog on a Stick was near where I live  When we head to the Southwest a trip to Hot Dog on a Stick is a must-do  Yes we've tried the hotdogs and liked them  However while good we don't long for them when we're home  The lemonade is another storyThe Hot Dog on a Stick in the Fiesta Mall has never disappointed us  The staff is friendly and efficient  One time I asked for a small empty cup to pour a little lemonade in it in order to take some medication that has to be added to a small amount of liquid  The staff gave me a cup without giving me a hard time or charging me any money for itIn conclusion if you haven't tried the lemonade I highly recommend that you do so.
2539,I hate to admit to my sweet tooth - and I do keep it under control most of the time But I did succumb today when I visited TopIt Cupcakes with my junior Yelper daughter AbbyAbby had chocolate with salty caramel icing and I had the ganache-filled chocolate cupcake  Yes you read that right - chocolate ganache filled Oh my Decadent rich over-filling Both were absolutely delightfulAfter we finished our treat I went back in and suggested that the owner participate in a Yelp event His cupcakes are better than others I've had at various events I guess I'll wait and see what happens Meanwhile when I have another sweet tooth I can't ignore I know how to fix it.
1482,Repaired my glasses for free Very friendly and customer service oriented Thank you.
3974,No customer service No sense of urgency  Was told by the manager of this place I was going to get a phone call back in 10 mins that was a failure  The longest 10mins of my life Am yet to get a call back.
3103,Was in Phoenix and wanted to Yelp a local place since I always have great luck with YelpI was staying in downtown and was happy to see that I would be able to walk to this restaurant that had such great reviews It was 'Open' on Yelp so I walked over there STARVING only for it to be closed WTH Seriously if you have your business on this site and have gone through the trouble of adding your hours they had better be correctVery upset that I could have chosen so many other places major boo boo.
3405,Instead of writing a review I'm going to write a warning Avoid this place at all costs If you want a lesson on how to run a successful Mexican restaurant do not come here From the kid at the hostess stand to the sub par food this was truly a horrible experienceOf course you start with complimentary chips and salsa Chips were room temp and not a single grain of salt Both salsas one mild chunky and another hot and smooth were both lacking salt garlic and heat essentially tomato sauce with some red pepper flakes added for good measureWe ordered a quesadilla with green chile ($600) and what they call a Hal's Sampler For Two ($1595) which is a sampling of all their house specials Pollo Fundido mini chimi's flauta's tostada's and a green corn tamale served with rice and beans Sounds promising and a no brainerAs soon as the quesadilla arrived we knew what we were in for The green chile's were of the canned variety and from the first bite of the old variety While the cheese was melted the quesadilla was just above room temp and the tortilla was more dried out then actually crisped on a flat top grill Each bite being worse then the last as the barely melted cheese coagulated around the wet mushy diced chile's No amount of salsa could save this one it was doaThen the sampler arrived if there were any high hopes of melty cheeses and tastes of thick guacamole they were squashed just as soon as the plate arrived The plate of beige had cheeses but were barley melted and like the quesadilla everything was just above room temperature Let me tell you there was nothing redeeming or delicious on this plate Just a sampler of dried out deep fried food covered in cheese and some hyper green bland version of guacamoleAfter a few bites of this and that we asked for the check and made our way for the door When I asked our server for a to go menu she seemed genuinely shocked that I may have thought that the food was good enough to order again I only needed it to make sure I got the information correct when writing this review The owner's should be ashamed of themselves In a market where there is decent Mexican food abound this kind of crap just doesn't fly.
2523,Love this place  Friendly staff great coffee and the best pancakes in town  The Hit-the-Spot pancakes are a must try  Fun place for evening coffee and dessert too  Try later in the evening and you might get free dessert as they clean out the case for the next day.
1301,YUM.
2479,I have been going to BB Hairrington's for about a year I always go to Nikki-I think she is amazing The salon is a decent size and has lots of stylists They offer you water or soda while you are getting all beautified Everyone seems to be friendly and the salon looks very cleanLike I said I use Nikki and I wouldn't consider going to anyone else If she is out of town I will wait She has really reasonable prices and I feel great everytime I leave There are plenty of places closer to my house (I live about 20 minutes away) but it's worth the drive for me Check out this place and definately ask for Nikki I get a cut with dark color and foil partial or all over foil Worth every penny and a lot cheaper than the last 4 places I've beenThey also have a gal that does nails but I think only one I haven't used her but I know she is available They offer some waxing servies also.
1091,I had been to Fuego Bistro before and really enjoyed it  So I was really looking forward to trying Fuego Cityscape with a Groupon I had bought  The food is absolutely delicious I had the Pernil Torta with the Sweet Potato fries the meet was soo amazing completely melt in your mouth and paired with the cabbage it was to die for  My friend had the quesadilla with Carne Asada he said it was very good  We also had the Key Lime Pie for dessert and it was awesome I love key lime anything and this did not dissapoint definitely one of the best key lime things I've had I also had the Prickly Pear Mojito which was a beautiful pinkish/purplish color  I enjoyed it very muchSam was our waiter and he was fantastic  He was getting ready for a table of 9 and he still managed to keep us and everyone else extremely happy  I was very impressed with his friendliness and expediting to make sure everyone had drinks and there food when it came out  I can't wait to go back again.
3219,After reading the great Yelp reviews on this place I was excited to go check it out and get supplies for a collage project I have in mind  I was immediately impressed with the variety and volume of paper and I really liked that they have grouped it by color family It's almost overwhelming all the beautiful paper they have there So why the one star Well I don't look like a hobo but for some reason I was never greeted or offered help once they finished with customers there before us Yet several older women who looked like  um seasoned shoppers came in after I did and were cheerfully greeted and assisted Honestly this wouldn't have been a big deal but the paper is arranged in layers on rods and I couldn't figure out how to remove it without messing up the other paper Eventually I got tired of being ignored and lefton the way out the man working there glanced my way and didn't say anything at all I was sad because I had no paper and felt unwelcome in their shop.
1858,Burnt bitter espresso Bitterly disappointing This place has so much potential the pasties look yummy I ordered my usual an iced triple soy latte to jolt me awake and fend off the morning headache (Not iced in the winter)This was not drinkable I will not be backFair Trade Cafe Lux AJs(even Starbucks) I am so sorry I cheated on you.
3230,"We visited the Valley Ho this past weekend for a bachelor party planning to take advantage of the ""hip"" pool scene and enjoy a nice weekend among friends  When our group arrived we loaded our luggage as well as a hefty amount of adult beverages onto a luggage cart and made our way to the rooms  I'd like to point out that there were 14 bigger guys on this trip and we were planning to stay for 3 days  We did not try to cram into rooms and had reserved 4 standard 2 double bed rooms along with a large suite  No later than 15 minutes after checking in there was a knock at the door by the 5'6"" head of security Mike that has an obvious small mans complex  When we asked if we had already been too loud and received a noise complaint he responded politely with a ""No we just noticed you gentlemen brought a large amount of alcohol with you and we wanted to remind you of our no party policy""  While we did have a large amount of booze on board it was for 14 people for 3 days  Good start to the trip and great first impressionWe brushed Mike off had a couple of cocktails and headed down to the pool  It was a Friday afternoon so there were a fair amount of people but not overly crowded  They have daily drink specials including buckets of beer so for a ""trendy"" hotel drinks were definitely reasonable  There were several groups of people tossing a nerf football across the pool to each other and the crowd was having a good time with it  That is until Mike decided to show up cell phone and maglite attached to his belt at the hip  He made a nice ""hey I'm open"" gesture with his arms making everyone think he wanted to join in the fun  Maybe he wasn't on such a power trip after all and we had misread him  Unfortunately we were wrong and when someone tossed him the ball he promptly took it away like an 8th grade bully  He didn't seem to mind all of the boos from the crowd as I am sure he is used to them by now  We made the best of the rest of the afternoon and went on to enjoy our evening out in ScottsdaleThe Saturday pool party we had heard about was what we were really looking forward to since we had heard it was one of the new hot spots in town  When we arrived at the pool we see a security line set up like it was a Vegas night club  Looked promising until we see our friend Mike working the door  None of us realized prior to the trip that only hotel guests were allowed in  This is the first time I have heard of this and one of the reasons The W down the street is a much better optionWe had reserved a cabana and the service staff all day was awesome  This review is in no way a reflection on them but simply management and security  When we had finally settled into the cabana area we notice that there is coincidentally a security guard posted just outside of it on the corner  Sweet  Thanks MikeI am not going to try and pretend that the group of guys we were with was this quiet bunch of friends looking for a relaxing day at the pool  We had come for the ""Hottest Day Party In Scottsdale"" we had read about and they also try to advertise  Several of the friends in the group get extremely rowdy but in a fun way that always gets the crowd going and laughing as well  After the first hour the crowd had been won over and everyone was having a good timeOur cabana had come with a bunch of pool toys including a blow up beach ball  That ended up in the pool for about 2 minutes until good old Mike could scamper over take it away from some other patrons and remove it from the party  Why the hell did you give it to us in the first place then  Once again the boos from the crowd didn't seem to phase him  On at least 5 occasions there were moments with other groups that also drew the same types of reactionsWe made the best of the day despite the fact that the DJ sucked and all started to head back up to the room  Our next wonderful experience occurred when we were making the 30 foot walk from the poolside door of the lobby to the elevators  Halfway through we hear a screeching voice screaming at 2 people in our group to put their shirts on  At this point of the day we definitely responded with some smart ass comment as we had had enough  I told the woman manager that this was the worst hotel experience I had ever had and her response was ""then why don't you stay somewhere else next time""  No problem thereThe only positives are that the rooms were nice the staff at the pool other than security was awesome  The rooms with two beds have full beds so if you plan on having 2 people in 1 it is not going to be comfortableOther than the room and the staff Mike sucked management sucked pool party and DJ sucked  Luckily the group we went out there with can make anywhere we are at a good time or we would have been even more disappointedHave fun."
4733,Went here for a manicure after previously having a shellac manicure elsewhere  Instead of soaking my nails in remover for 5-10 minutes to take off the old polish the nail technician pried/chiseled the old polish off with a fake nail  It hurt and left my nails brittle until they grew out (over a month)  There are plenty of great nail salons in the area that provide top notch service at an affordable price - don't waste your time here.
1230,This place is legitIf you are having a craving for a delicious burger you should check it out for sure All sort of interesting burgers and specialsI imagine they are busy for lunch but it has never been crowded for dinnerTry the sweet potato tots Super good.
579,Great eats at this joint New York strip was awesome Pear salad was bomb and service was superb I'll be back march 10th.
2622,"So I came on here to ""Rag on Red"" Looks like a LOT of people beat me to it After having a great brunch at St Francis across the parking lot my boyfriend and I decided to take a peek in Well first of all I wasn't sure there was anyone there for a while Which was fine we just kept looking around and being goofy looking at all the cool old stuff that they have to offer As we made our way through the store I found who I could only make out as a sales man sitting in front of some lady on a computer They bothered themselves to greet us at that point Never getting out of their seats at any point of our visit (I've worked my way through college/law school doing retail big no-no not greeting customers and making them feel un-welcomed)Soooo I was mindlessly walking around the furniture portion of the store whenGASSSSSPPPP I tapped on some of the furniture with my finger nail You would have though I had taken a hammer to it with their reaction I was admiring their selection and not reading all the little signs about not touching anything WhateverI was annoyed with them not wanting me to touch anything but alas its their store if they don't want people to enjoy their products that's their business What blew my top was when my boyfriend (who is very friendly and is always interested in what a business has to offer) asked them a question about a chair An Egg Chair You would have thought he sounded like a babbling idiot because their answers where so pretentious and condescending He asked about other things they had in the store and they had the same cold attitude everyone else on here talks about  Anyway I'm assuming that the majority of the their actual customers come from web sales because there is no way anyone I know would spend that kind of money on furniture when the sales staff is acting like they're doing you a favor by allowing you to breath in their precious vintage air."
1708,Let me start off by saying it was a awesome massage I didn't want to leave But be aware that it starts off a bit odd thankfully I was with a great friend which made me way more comfortable than if I was alone Starting off no one really tells you what will happen you simply lay down & wait The men are in & out of the room several times bring a warm water foot soak coving your body with a large towel warm neck roll & a towel to cover your eyes  But but when they start the start & it's fantastic I really love the pressure point relief It was priced very reasonably  $20 for 30 mins & $30 for 60 mins  I will defiantly go back & next time my husband wants to join in the fun.
2393,Wow Thank you Yelp I've lived in the neighborhood for almost 4 years and had never tried George's until yesterday The location makes it a bit tough to recognize from the road The original gyro was fantastic Has to be the most meat I've ever had in a gyro and great flavor too So I took the to-go menu with me and saw something intersting George's Chicken Faliro Had it for lunch today :) sliced chicken breast artichoke hearts and capers sauteed in olive oil butter and a little lemon topped with a bit of feta all over pasta outstanding Great value will definitely be back.
2573,This Mesa location for Souper Salad has undergone drastic improvements in the last month or so and I would like to compliment them on a job well done Gone are the greasy tables and dirty heat lamps the permanently ill staff coughing on the dinner trays the poorly laid-out floor plan and the perennially dirty windows Now the place is open inviting and full of sunlight and air Yes it's closed now and the doors are locked but think of the favor they've done you--now you can't eat there if you tried.
4943,"I used to LIKE this location bcz it was close About 6 wks ago they ran out of Thera Balls which I and many others use to warm up do ab exercises and stretch About a mo ago I asked when they would be replaced and was told they were on back order After sev'l wks I asked again This time the guy at the desk basically barked at me and said they had just ""popped"" the wk before I told him that they actually had been out for at least several weeks He then proceeded to yell at me in front of several trainers and employeesnot cool Customer service Zero I bought my own ball and am now going to another gym Good luck doing well in this economy when superior product and customer service is king."
3641,This is a review for the Nationwide on FLW Blvd in Scottsdale  Long story short I have been wearing contacts for 30 yrs  Went in May of 2013 for an eye exam where I spent almost 1K for both glasses and multifocal contact lenses  They did my eye exam and I actually had a great fit and was very happy with my AirOptix mulit focal  I did not go back to make sure the fitting was right as I am extremely busy and did not know it was mandatory to go back within 90 days  I thought I had 90 days to make sure if they weren't right I only had that long  Nobody stressed that they would not allow me to order more contacts if I did not go back  I have been wearing contacts for 30 yrs and know when I have a good fit  5 months later I have an eye infection that I needed to make an appt for so obviously a charge for that  Well I informed them before my appt that I would like a sample as I just opened my last contacts and I cant wear them again because of this infection  I said I will need to order some at the same time  They refused to order more contacts and said I needed a whole new exam since I didn't come back for my follow up  I said my perscription should be good for 1 yr and it has only been 5 months  Basically they said too bad I have to have another full exam just to get a new perscription  They said I was lucky that they give more than a month  I have never heard of this  This is a way to get more money for another exam  I will never go to any Nationwide vision again after that  I am on a budget so to come up with another $125 or $150 just to get the exact same perscription that I just got from them 5 months ago is ridiculous  They just lost a customer for life  They might want to make it clear to their patients that if they don't come back in 90 days they will not get to order any more contacts for the year  Its just crazy.
2604,"So I read all the wonderful reviews and thought how great--fabulous food at the airport  I was seated promptly and spoke to the waitress Christina about vegetarian options and on her recommendation ordered the veggie burger (no bun) and the side veg of broccoli rab which she described as ""yummy""and asked for a glass of water with a slice of lemon Water arrived: no lemon Food arrived delivered by someone other than Christina Burger on large slab of iceberg lettuce I  took a first bite of burger--lukewarm temp But the sauce on the side was good Brocolli rab was cold When (with the assistance of the gentleman at the next table) I was finally able to get Christina's attention I asked if the vegetable was supposed to be cold No she said So I sent it backTake two: at my prompting Christina reached over to the bar and dumped a piece of lemon into my glass of water A third person came to my table with a veggie burger and broccoli rab but no sauce I tried to point out to him that the sauce was missing and he waved me away I tried the brocolli rab the second time--this time literally handing a piece to Christina and asking her if she thought it was warm She didn't She asked me how the burger was this time around and I said that as I was still waiting for the sauce chances were that if it were hot it wouldn't be by the time that I got the sauce and a third try on the vegetablesDecided to find a place that can actually serve hot food--maybe even the first time So much for fab food at the airport."
3199,"E2 was great until a few months ago when I noticed their lattes started tasting like there was no espresso in them  I mentioned this 3 times and it never got fixed so I stopped going  Stopped in recently to see if they'd fixed it and got a latte that was basically steamed milk and vanilla  When I asked about it the girl drew me another ""double"" shot and it was about 2/3 the size of a single shot  Looks like their machine is not calibrated to measure out shots correctly or (and I hope not) they are purposefully shafting customers on the amount of espresso they put in their drinks  If I'm going to pay $5 for a latte it needs to be made correctly  Get on it guys."
1618,Good old fashioned Italian food their salad lasagna was excellent when I'm back in az u will see me there lol but really.
2856,"Horrible horrible service  I'll start off by saying this was our last shot at giving PF Chang our business because of a horrible dining experience the last time we dined inWe got there right at the start of dinner service  There was no wait but the two of us started the night's waiting list  We were told 5 minutes  We were seated in the foyer and watched 12 customers leave after eating  12  Were we seated  Nope  We watched about 20-25 more people come in and get on the list before we were finally seated after a 20 minute wait  I even asked the hostess how much longer and she replied with a ""snippy"" answer that we were next  Really  We were next  I think we could have figured that out since we were the first ones on the listWaitress was very friendly but the service was atrocious  We ordered a bottle of wine which took a while to get to us  When it did my wine glass was disgusting  It took 7 minutes to get a new glass  Seriously  7 minutes for a glass  My wife and I ordered the dinner for two which includes soup for each  Lo and behold my soup spoon had some brown stuff crusted on it  Had to wait wait wait for the waitress to return  She was no where in sight  Not in the dining room anyway  Didn't take as long to get a new spoon and she did apologizeThe food arrived in a reasonable time and it was good  Soup crab wontons sesame chicken sweet and sour pork  It was decent  But it was all delivered by food runnersWhen it came time for dessert we sat there and waited almost another 10 minutes for her to bring the dessert tray by and show us what they had  I think you can figured by now how long it took to get the bill and then to get the check to sign  We got there shortly after 5 pm and didn't get out of there until 7:30     To sum up food = okay  Service = TERRIBLE."
497,Best cab EVER Larry and Sofeni (hope I spelled that ok) are wonderful I will never call any other cab service Clean nice cab courteous service Prompt Calls to confirm You have to use them You will be very satisfied.
4451,The store is dirty but much worse the folks at the registers seem to be trained to be rude and have the social skills of a grocery bag  I live less than a mile away and was excited to find a Sprouts in my new neighborhood  After the first few times there I stopped going and drive well past this store to others  Recently I needed some organic tomatoes quickly and so I thought I would give this Sprouts another try The girl behind the register never spoke to me and seemed as if it was a real inconvenience to ring up four tomatoes She practically threw my change and receipt at me  Never again  Five or six times of poor service is enough.
2026,This place rocksI tried BevMo and it was OK but Total Wine is the place to go their prices are the lowest I have seen their selection is great I like several types of liquor but have never been a huge fan of winesThat changes every time I come to this storeThe wine tasting has really taught me how to select wines The staff is great There is one person there (sorry I don't know his name) that I have gone to a few times and said this is what I am fixing for dinner and this is what my guest like I want something newHe makes recommendations (usually less expensive than what I was looking at) I buy them and my guests are thrilledIf you are looking for a relaxing afternoon out of the heat go to one of their wine tastings (some times they taste other liquor too)If you want beer selection go thereThey have several Gluten free beers alsoI have to stop myself from visiting the store whenever I drive by Its just that good.
4383,We were greeted at the door by two lovely ladies The place was not busy yet they said that it would be a 45 min wait to be seated out sideSo we took the first available15 minutes later after I spoke to the bartender and asked him why the wait for a table outside was 45 minutes yet no one is here We were seatedFood options seemed interesting but NOT for the priceAtmosphere is greatIf u want a quiet spot wait to go to this place when construction is done in downtown because they are building a Tilted Kilt pub upstairs and it was nosier then the people eating dinner  If u are a very wealthy person (your salary is more then 100000 by yourself) u will be able to afford eating and drinking here.
3820,My company uses this Enterprise on a weekly basis  We need a car each Tuesday Wednesday and every other Thursday  Since October they have been on time only twice  When they are late our schedule is affected and we must use our own vehicle.
3142,"Normally I wouldn't take the time to review a place like Chili's We all know by now how unoriginal and uninspiring their menu is and that Chili's is the Denny's of late night grub Well having said this the reason that I'm reviewing Chili's today is to tell you about an interesting thing that happened to my bf and I when we visited this Chili's not too long ago First shame on us for resorting to eating here but it was a cold winter night and we didn't want to venture too far from home There food is so forgettable that I honestly can't even remember what we had I just remember that it wasn't that great I think we had some sort of sliders and maybe some taco's that we took a few bites of and quickly got sick of The real reason that I am writing however is to tell about a lame thing that happened to us when we visited (even lamer than the food) My boy and I were cuddling in a booth his arm was around my shoulder and my hand was on his thigh We were talking to each other and laughing to ourselves quietly nothing out of the ordinary if you ask me We had ordered a dessert and were eating that when all of a sudden the manager of the joint comes up to our booth and says ""How's the dessert let's keep it a family restaurant"" Before we could even respond he was gone and we just turned to each other with a bewildered look for the next 5 minutes We couldn't figure out what we had done and the more we thought about it the madder we got It's not like we were having sex on the table or touching each other inappropriately in the restaurant We were simply sitting close to each other cuddling and eating our dessert We were so mad that we blew out of that joint and left our unfinished dessert on the table We have never been back and we probably never will since we do not want to eat in a place that reprimands you for cuddling and having a good time If a family restaurant is anything like Chili's then I never want to eat in a family restaurant again  Keep it a family restaurant my ass there's probably more drug deals that go on there than anywhere in Scottsdale."
1333,I work in the building so grabbing a quick lunch is convenient  however each time I get sucked back in -I regret it  I went in today for and ordered a BLT- $850 w a drink and chips3 slices of bacon and GREEN tomatoes  Since I'm still hungry i will find a real value in the vending machinesI need a shock collar to prevent my return in the future.
3070,I had a flat tire twice in one week (my kind of luck) on two different tires and went here and had the most top  notch service and the most helpful and accommodating staff at any discount tire I have ever been to  I would recommend this location and the way this staff treats the customers to be the example of training for all other stores  I was in and out in less than 30 minutes each time no charge as I had the insurance and just really very happy.
4161,"I agree with the other reviews - but for different reasons   The management company (LPC / Lincoln Properties) ""big corporation"" approach trickles down and causes onsite management to behave like detached dronesTradition at Kierland is as beautiful as it looks     But it's not worth it  Be very afraid:  Being  ""managed"" by a huge property company means that the on-site management can do or say as they please (or do nothing) and hide behind ""the company"" since there is no one you can get ahold of in the event of a problem or dispute   The legal practices are questionable - like not showing you the entire lease until the day you move in - then you are surprised with some incredible terms:  Sure you don't have to sign - but this is on the day you have abandoned your old place and arrive with a moving truck wanting the keys     Also - don't be fooled by the seemingly incredible discounts (if you sign a 13 or 24 month lease) - they are indeed too good to be true - and you will indeed regret being fooled   I assume they can only get away with these practices due to the economy perhaps with so many people trying to rent instead of own - but this is only grasping for a reason that the company and management behave so badly   Be aware of any company that seems to have as many lawyers than maintenance staff  (they lawyers respond faster than maintenance)   Run - don't walk - away  there are lots of other places  (just read the fine print to make sure they are not managed by Lincoln Properties/LPC or one of their affiliates)."
402,Yum and more Yum  We went for dinner and got really lucky that we didn't have to wait The bruschetta is wonderful and they have a great wine selection  Just thinking about how good everything was makes my mouth water and I want to go back.
3660,This place never answers it phones So unprofessional Ugh big mistake I'm taking my business to 4 wheel parts performance center.
1507,Love this theater  We go there all the time  We have the souvenier cups and loyalty shirt to get discounts on soda and popcorn.
2172,I've got two words for you people  Well technically one word and one hyphenated slang term  Regardless it is FREE WIFI  That's right at the freaking nail salonI realize that I have issues when I judge my nail salons solely upon internet access but it is a beautiful thing when you can get a pedicure in the middle of the workday and not get busted for it because you are fully functional from your laptop the entire timeThat said it is also a nicely sized CLEAN facility that is surprisingly inexpensive considering it's location on the corner of Central Ave and Camelback  I used to pay an extra $5 in Scottsdale and at least another couple of bucks in Tempe as wellThe nail techs are all delghtful and speak english as well which as most of you know is not often the case  I have never had to wait more than 5 minutes before I'm in a chair with my feet in hot water including New Years Eve which is pretty incredible  My toes always come out looking lovely which is the icing on the cake  Price is right quality is right staff is right wifi is oh so right consider me a customer for life.
1457,The Stetson Chopped salad is something that has no equalIf you're from the Phoenix area or have visited a few times you've probably run into a similar chopped salad at other restaurants but Cowboy Ciao was actually the inventor of this yummy treat So you should definitely try it here first if you want the true AZ Stetson experienceI hate salmon With a passion In fact I hate most seafood But the smoked salmon in this salad is seriously delicious It doesnt even taste like salmon it's sweet slightly smoky and the texture is similar to a ripe tomato I know that sounds gross but I swear it's notI got my salad to-go before having a girls' night in with some friends and I ordered it about 5 minutes before I headed out the door to grab it To my shock and wonderment the salad was ready for me before I walked through the door even though the hostess told me it would 15-20 minutes Awesome The guys behind the bar were efficient with getting me my food eating utensils and taking care of my bill I was in and out in less than 5 minutesThe salad isn't as good when you're eating it from a box but it was still delectable The dressing to die for It's a pretty pricey restaurant (I think my salad was around $20 total after taxes and a $2 tip) but I was craving it so what could I do The only downside to the entire place is the lack of parking which in my opinion is a big turn-off for this entire area of Old Town But that obviously has nothing to do with Cowboy Ciao more so it's just a complaint for me to take up with the local mayor.
114,I haven't had Hong Kong style pot pot since I lived in Manila so I was so excited to hear about Tien Wong Hot Pot It was delicious It's also fun to eat as a family putting different foods into the broth It's a great experience for a meal to share and talk Very cute and chic ambiance Professional and attentive service I will go back again and again.
4903,I went here after seeing a picture of their oreo pancakes on the flyer (Menu description said cocoa based pancakes with white chocolate butter creme filling and the photo actually looked like a big oreo) Sounds amazing right Well what i got was a normal buttermilk pancake with crumbled oreos and hersheys syrup on it Not cool Eggs benedict More like eggs beneDONT The yolk was hard and not runny at all Hollandaise sauce was overly lemony and the ham was probably oscar meyer Fresh squeezed orange juice was luke warmEven after comping the oreo pancakes due to false advertisement the bill was still 84 dollars for 4 people's brunch Not worth itWe were expecting great food based on their advertisements and pictures and this was just not the case Ill be having brunch at crepe bar on weekends from now on.
1458,I have spent more hours here than I can count - and even if there were no traveling special exhibits I'd find something new every timeGranted - I am that person who spent over an hour staring at a single Kandinsky a few years back I do have real appreciation for the special exhibitionsI also appreciate the sculptures in the courtyard the miniatures the Asian collection and several other pieces from the permanent collection One of the advantages of being in Phoenix is the accessible parking (happily also along the light rail) and the reasonable entrance fees (To the people who gripe about the museum and theater prices in Phoenix - go to NYC San Francisco Boston Chicago etc We have bargains in comparisonHaving lived in PHX for as long as I have I've watched the museum grow Section by section I appreciate the modern lines and use of light throughout - and given how many additions have been built on over the years it's still architecturally coherentThe cafe is a nice pit stop and the gift shop is well stocked and has something for everyone There are great events through the course of the year - and annual membership is well worth the price for how much you get in exchange.
4858,Yeah i'm gonna go ahead and down-grade my rating from my previous review The lack of awareness and attention you get as a customer is very inadequate I have ordered take out and dined in since my last review and just wasn't pleased at all 1 with the quality of the food and 2 with their customer serviceAnother long wait until our server showed up I wanted to leave but my I didn't want to be like that It is just ridiculous to me that it would take soooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo long for anyone to address you once seated I won't miss this place too much aside from the Bacon Won Tons oh well.
4746,Bought a group coupon to this location and I wanted to use it today  This location is closed down  Called the Frank Lloyd Wright location and asked whether they would honor the coupon  Was told to call back when the manager arrives @ 5pm and ask him  Hopefully they'll honor it  Have to wait and see.
2263,This is literally the best taco truck I've ever had I came to visit a friend in Phoenix and we went here after a night of fun at Charlie's Not only is the food amazing and full of flavor but it's beyond reasonable Tacos are only a $100 and oI don't remember anything being over $700 It was so good I went here twice during my visit to Phoenix I tried the carne asada tacos super nachos with asada mini quesadilla with chicken and another one with carne asada I think the quesadilla tastes best with asada If you love authentic Mexican food you must try Taqueria Los Yaquis.
443,Service was ok except from the inexperienced management Numerous complaints about the NFL games on the TV Even though the majority of the customers were there to watch a demographic specific team the manager refused to accomodate  the cries of the consumers to satisfy his own pallet  I know first hand how difficult it can be to set up a restaurants numerous game day programming but after a few months of walking the floor talking to people looking around at what type of crowd is showing up to spend money at your establishment you can get a pretty damn good idea of how to go about it It is a week by week decision that needs to be taken into account and not something that is pre-set 2 weeks in advance Shame on the inexperienced managers for not having a clue about the demographics interested in spending money here We should have walked out and gone elsewhere like a large handful of other customers.
831,This place is awesome I visited the shop after seeing it in passing a few times Any candy you could possibly ever want is here No joke Friendly atmosphere and more candy than anyone would know what to do with It is like a candy wonderland.
1349,this made going to the movies fun againvery comfortable chairs spacious decent foodthe servers were nice and courteous  I really enjoyed going herewill definately come again.
4557,Very Disappointed We were really looking forward to their opening since we live in the neighborhood and it is within walking distance It advertised itself as a wine barnot so much Postinos and Bomberos are wine bars This place is more a beer and burger joint We ordered the garage meat and cheese plate and when it was delivered may husband and I just looked at one another We could not believe for the price we were being served what looked like some refrigerator leftovers I would have been embarrassed to serve this to anyone There was not even enough meat or cheese for one person and it was served with two little pieces of crostini Two glasses of wine and the platter with tax was around $40 We left and went down the street to Postino's for their antipasti boardwow what a difference Their chef needs to visit the competition and learn what is out there To say the least we will not be returning.
1350,By far my GREATEST yoga experience to date The studios are neautiful and peaceful the people who work there are great and the instructors are A+ You've not experienced yoga until you've practiced at At One My personal favorite instructors are Max Julie Jen C Johanna and Alex Definitely check it.
3051,"I am SO glad to find this A guy from Mexico I dated took me here and I've wanted to get back but could not remember the name You know  if you're like me- I'm always looking & looking at little hole-in-the-wall Mexican places wondering:  gem food poisoning 6 :00 news ""outing"" This is in the gem category Be fearless be confident go eat there."
3596,I have never been in such an amazing property and had such a horrible time made arrangements one month in advance for a friend of mine booked it with Erin( if she is not fired yet end the conversation as soon as she gets on the phone)for 20 plus 23- 26yr old women   after waiting out front for 20min Erin cleared the guests to enter she then attempted to pass off a room that had seating reserved for the guest bartenders guests being obviously overbooked she then tried to tell me i was obligated to buy 6 bottom shelf bottles (at a price i am too embarrassed to mention ) and seating for maybe 4  after about 20 more minutes of yelling back and fourth over the music she tried to have the now 20+ guests escorted out birthday girl in tears we moved the party back in to another friends table to try and save the nightstay away lame scene horrible service with so many options in old town this is not where u want to find yourself any night of the weekon top of it the local police have to have at least 3 squad cars parked there all night clearly the staff has no control over the customers that is the last thing i want to walk past when i leave the club with my friends.
3003,LOVE LOVE LOVE Stinkweedsit is such a jewel of a record storea true snapshot of culture in PhoenixAND locally ownedso even better.
4833,Oh boy not a fan at all  Tottie's is right by my house so I checked the reviews and it appeared to be a good take out spot  I ordered a Thai noodle dish with Tofu and my Bf ordered Pad Thai I ordered both medium spice level  My Bf picked it up and he said the place spelled rancid not a good sign   Both of our meals were terrible had no sauce whatsoever and mine was so spicy it was inedible  I love spicy food so it's not that I can't tolerate the heat this was just bad  I threw out my meal and ate popcorn for dinner.
4049,Not vegetarian friendly They will not deviate from their menu to make the simple substitutions required to make vegetarian options They are over priced My bf says their meat stuff is tasty Store never looks very clean and employees don't go out of their way to be friendly or helpful.
4558,Still sickening Really I got sick twice here I tried this place again because other friends of mine say that they really like it  Apparently they are not eating at the one in Maricopa  I should know better when they still do not know what oregano is when I ask for it  I recently also went to a Barro's in Mesa and I had not a problem  It was fabulous  So maybe it is JUST this one I am just unlucky here.
1571,This place is cute but that's about it Everything is made from cake mixes nothing is from scratch not even the frosting Ew You're better off going to safeways bakery than here to be honestIt's overpriced & poor quality boring tastes and really they only have cakesI'm a pastry chef so I like to think I know what I'm talking about ].
1946,Premium price but worth the extra cost if you have the cash to burn Fantastic place for date nights will definitely impress.
4567,"Pretty all-around terrible experience at RnR last week between the food the drinks the service and the cleanliness  I had heard about the place for a while so I suggested it to my group of 4  We decided to pay a visit during the early evening  It's a very nice space with Scottsdale-attractive staffand that's about where the positive part of this review ends Upon arrival we ordered four cocktails from their ""signature"" cocktail list then watched as muscles the bartender read a cheat sheet on exactly how to make them While the bartender was clearly struggling with the ""signature"" cocktails we ordered several shared appetizers--which came out long before the cocktails ever arrived  The food was cold and some items were not cooked all the way through--maybe a product of them being rushed to our table for some reason  ""Baked"" brie was cold and unmelted and the much-hyped animal fries looking like they'd been under a heat lamp for hours (but still cold)the only decent thing was the shrimp tacos but it's pretty hard to screw up a fried shrimp taco Then the cocktails arrived and perhaps predictably they all came out looking and tasting awful just the wrong balance of flavors and not mixed correctly  The ice had melted because of the time spent trying to mix them  And two of them kinda tasted like rubbing alcohol Or gasoline  Our server had disappeared from the beginning leaving us with runners who would only say ""I'll get your server"" whenever we had even the simplest of requests--like: ""can we get some side plates"" ""I'll get your server""  Finally fifteen minutes after the food arrived the server came by and provided us with side plates for the shared appetizers  Not that we needed them at that point but the side plates were still very wet from being washed and several had food residue on them Disgusting After the four terrible $13 cocktails cold appetizers poor service and dirty plates we decided to pack in our planned dinner and head down the street to a place that knew how to mix a drink and cook  Of course it took forever to get our check because the server pulled another disappearing act for about 20 minutes and when the check came we were shocked at how much all this awfulness cost: almost $90 to be fed cold food and bad drinks while being ignored  Sorry RnR but we're never coming back and we've told many people to do the same."
547,As much as I like Five Guys I just got home and there was no meat on my burger How can you be a burger place and forget the most basic necessity Very upset that they forgot to put the hamburger on to complete the burger Everything else is on the supposed hamburger lettuce onions tomatoes ketchup mayo But no meat.
2812,I am craving pizza right now and know that I will be placing an order at Spinatos to take home for dinner tonight I have been a customer for about three years now and it is my favorite pizza ever It will change your life.
3849,This restaurant would've received four stars because the chicken red curry was spicy and tasty the happy hour cocktail was great and the edamame was perfectly salted And even though our server was a newbie she was still attentive and got answers to all our happy hour and menu QsUnfortunately none of this matters because I got food poisoning I'm guessing from the chicken because no one else in my party got ill and I was the only one who ordered chicken Worst 48 hours of my life I'll never return.
2385,I have always wanted to try Mood Swings and thanks to Yelp I did  I didn't know they provided so many services and the prices are so reasonable  I loved the mini salon services that were provided  I can't wait to book an appointment for a facial  Thanks for the amazing goodie bag.
2111,We went to our first show at the Orpheum Theatre last nightI thought the theater was absolutely beautiful I loved the intricate architecture It felt old but stately It's got tons of character and I found myself taking pictures everywhere The sound was wonderful as well  We saw Jake Shimabukuro ukulele virtuoso there It was a perfect venue for him So beautiful stately quiet with great acoustics It really highlighted his performanceI found out it was built from 1927-1929 in Spanish Midieval and Baroque styles After a while it was turned into a movie theater and remained that for years and years They painted the murals and moldings black during the movie era In the late 80s they started a renovation on it which was completed in 1997 They brought back much of the original design (moldings murals etc)Now it's just wonderful Anytime I see something interesting playing there the theatre itself will definitely add to the draw Can't wait to head back.
1681,The jade red chicken is amazing The cookies are the perfect ending to a meal.
3733,some of the vegetables that they use here are not even fresh look like they are come from a frozen veggies bag that you could get at Walmart The food is way too expensive with a small portion Haft order of the tom kha soup is way too much mushroom than meat very disappointed.
2656,I have ate here a few times and found it pretty descent Tonight I go with my wife & I order a Gyro Entree I was sitting right in front of the prep area As I sat there part of my to go order was sitting waiting for the rest to be completed the owner (I believe) brought out a gyro entree to a table behind where I was waiting The young lady indicated they ordered a Chicken gyro entree The owner brought it back behind the counter & spoke with the young man prepping the food The young man took that food that was brought back from a table (I will also mention that the customer had touched the food) next thing I know as quick as it was brought back it was in a to go container & was handed my food I questioned the owner about it he addressed the young man prepping the food & they denied it right to my face It is highly insulting as they knew I was standing right there watching this take place Not only is that a health code violation but to lie right to my face when I seen it with my own eyes This place is disgusting what happens that you don't see  Stay away I will tell all my friends and neighbors to stay away.
175,Such a wonderful place My husband and I spent our wedding night here and it was just a beautiful place We went to breakfast the next morning were there was a really good buffet We will be back soon.
2174,I was disappointed in our experience After waiting for an hour for a table we were taken to the bar section of the restaurant which smelled like a fraternity basement I was also offended to see the blue tortilla's made in an open public area by an individual not wearing gloves Gross.
4613,You feel like you're in a used car lot  The staff is WAY too aggressive with sales my last Dental office treated patients more like a real Doctor  not just a customer to see how much money they can get out of every visit.
4438,"Responded to a promotion of theirs that excluded ""holidays""  This was Dec 24 which is the day BEFORE a holiday yet they refused to honor the promotion on the basis that Dec 24 is a holiday  Had to wait for a table even though there seemed to be plenty available  Service was slow and the food was mediocre plus they forgot my side dish  Very disappointing because we had heard such good things about this place."
1495,Super friendly staff not expensive food Simple menu but delicious food Breakfast burrito is bomb Haven't checked it out yet but apparently they have a full bar too.
2561,Best BBQ salad in the valley I challenge you to try it out.
1352,this is the tiniest little store but i love it the owner is the nicest lady ever i love to support these little stores she's a mom herself and you can just tell she enjoys maintaining and is very proud of this store they have great prices on resale items and carry a few new items here and there i found a mobile i've been eyeing for a while it was less than half the price of a new one and in wonderful condition i was so thrilled this will be a common stop for me.
550,Probably the most painless easiest and quickest car fix I've ever had All the reviews of this place are correct: the service is great and they get it done without making you sign away your first born child  No extras or addonsAmazingly convenient if you live downtown as there is a DASH stop across the street.
2639,"We arrived at Portlands hungry after checking out several other downtown spots and finding them lifeless Portlands looked great from the outside especially after the 'vacant lot' surroundings of other downtown spots  We walked into Portlands finding it near-deserted and ICY cold - on a lovely warm summer's evening  So we asked to be seated outside the host told us to seat ourselves outside which we did  We waited a LONG time for a server - we were thirsty and hungry and still had not been given menus or water  There was only one other table occupied inside and a few folks at the bar  so we could not understand the delay  Finally a waiter arrived handed us menus and proceeded to explain some complicated arrangement along the lines of "" the outside is really closed but I will give you menus and then you can come inside  ""  I was so angry I got up and walked out  My partner explained that maybe they just wanted to come inside to order - that we would be served the food outside but I didn't interpret what she said that way  but anyway - the place was EMPTY so a) why was it an ice-box and b) why could we not sit where we wanted Was it too far for the waiter to walk outside  I'm really trying to give the downtown restaurants a chance in Phoenix but - after this we jumped in our car and drove to downtown Scottsdale where we found a lively bar/restaurant and had a great meal  I really wish this place well - but I doubt I'll be returningAnd PLEASE - all restaurants take note - not many people want to sit in 60-degree air when it is a near-perfect 85 outside  I figure the A/C thermostat is set by some waiter who is hot from running in and out of the kitchen  we diners aren't looking for an arctic experience."
1840,"I've been a fan of Simply Bread for awhile (Drip Coffee Lounge serves their bread) I had yet to stop in to the bread bar because they carry the same hours I do (9-5 M-F) I can tell you it was well worth it Very friendly and happy to give samples I bought a loaf of ""The Don"" and the chocolate chip cookies perfect."
2506,Finally La Condessas sister spot is open If you love La Condessa and are on the Westside then make sure to come in The Horchata is the best I've ever had My favorite tacos are the chicken mole tinga cochinita pibil and el gaucho They have a huge salsa bar with tons of options.
1967,THIS STORE CLOSED RECENTLY I'm really going to miss this little gem.
4133,Never used the service but I was just driving near this dude and he drives like an asshole Who knows maybe he was in a hurry to pick someone up but that doesn't give him an excuse to weave in between traffic and then ride someone's bumper when he can't get around them I definitely wouldn't use this company even if someone paid me.
1804,TURN AND RUNFirstthe staff is terrible and rude They talk to you like you are 5 Second- We ordered a rose gold band to match my wife's rose gold engagement ring 3 months later we discover that the band is actually sterling silverSTERLING SILVER They charged us $700 for a sterling silver ring that may have been dipped in rose gold The receipt says ROSE GOLD CUSTOM BAND I am appalled and have filed complaints with the FTC BBB and AZ Attorney Generals Office FM may be a great jeweler as my Tucson store was awesome The manager Diana is amazing That ring I purchased in Tucson still looks amazing.
4207,Ordered online Went to pick up meal and it wasn't ready They quickly prepared the meal and when I got home I found that they had prepared everything incorrectly  We were missing 2 items one item mistakenly contained shrimp (which one patron in our party has a sever allergy) we had one pasta dish that we didn't order It was a disaster When I called toilet them know the manager told me there was nothing they could do because they were busy but did offer to give me a $7 off coupon the next time I came in all I had to do was let them know when I order againI won't order again.
4489,"I have been a frequent goer to this restaurant while living in the city and while the food and drinks are great the service is absolutely terrible I have never met such an overly arrogant and prideful staff They feel that as long as you have a minor issue it is your fault and not theirs For example my friend specifically asked for the midnight martinis it is 12:02 PM She serves us full sized martinis My friend was a little concerned that the waitress didn't hear us correctly and to make sure we were not being charged full priced she flagged the waitress over to which she says ""those are full priced martinis"" My friend proceeds to state that we have specifically requested midnight martinis to which the waitress responds ""I didn't hear you"" So instead of apologizing for the misunderstanding and offering the midnight specials she retaliates and gets defensive Because of her incompetence we request to speak to the manager to which he towers over the table and asks ""What's going on here"" oh hi nice to see you too He didn't even introduce himself properly nor professionally I was so turned off by the negative and defensive attitude that I have just about had it with that place IT is not the first time I have received this poor service and they need to get off their high horse and get their game together Sorry i'm not sorry Hanny's but we're going to have to part waysWhat is a huge turn off of all is knowing that after scrolling through these reviews 1 out 5 customers are very unhappy with the service provided and almost all have the same context ""servers and waitstaff are rude"" I am pleading out to the owner of Hanny's: For the sake of you're great restaurant please hire new management and waitstaff they are making you look horrible."
3634,"so i went here for lunch with my boyfriend the restaurant is a fairly good size and we were there around 1145 it was so slow maybe 15 people in the whole place we ordered 2 rolls and 45 minutes later still no rolls i stopped the server asked him what had happened to our food and he said ""its out of my hands"" i ask for a manager he goes to the back to get her she goes to the sushi bar and this other lady comes over to us she said well what do you want to do get your food and go or just go she was incredibly rude but we ended up getting the rolls about 15 minutes later and she says ""hey thanks guys"" WHAT She was the WORST manager i have ever seen deal with a bad situation had no realization at all for customer service none i know we will never ever go back here again oh yeah and when we went to eat the food the order was wrong ridiculous worst sushi place ever."
1446,Two words: summer rates You can play at the best golf courses in town during the middle of the summer for mere pennies (if you can handle a little heat) The Phoenician golf course is spectacular and only around $35 in the summer Now I am not a seasoned golfer In fact I would barely call myself a newbie golfer I am slowly but surely trying to learn but my bf is a very seasoned golfer and he decided to take me to one of his favorite golf courses to help me learn the ropes of the swing Everything about the Phoenician golf course is high-end clean friendly and an overall nice experience Upon entering the golf facilities you have the option to visit Relish which is a delicious restaurant overlooking the first hole You can also order cocktails at the bar to take with you on the course The bathrooms are very nice as well and the pro shop is stocked full of binge purchases waiting for your wallet The driving range has plenty of spots and buckets of golf balls waiting to be hit I noticed a golf pro conducting lessons that looked appealing After taking a few practice shots we were on our way There are two courses one that goes through the dessert canyons and one that goes into the mountain more Both courses are lovely and have several water features nice views of Camelback Mountains and a nice outline that most any golfer would enjoy playing on Now I just have to get better at golf so I can play these nice courses in the nicer weather months.
913,"When I first went to the room store I thought it was awesome The sales guy tommy offered me a great deal on my new mattress a hundred off the bed free delivery and a free mattress protector I've had the mattress set for a month now mattress isn't that great and doesn't feel like the one in store That's not the real issue though I applied for financing on it and got my first bill yesterday The total was supposed be a little under 700 but when I opened the bill is was almost a thousand dollars I called the room store talked to several managers including the store manager and all he had to say on the matter was that I got charged for the mattress protector delivery and the hundred off the bed wasn't taken off I didn't even want the mattress protector in the first place but I figured since it was free I'd take it After about an hour and a half all he offered to do was give me the mattress protector for free but still charge me the delivery and not fix the price on the bed I continued to fight with him about the deal I had made he said he'd call me back in an hour with more of what he could do Still no call back from him I'm about ready to return it It's not comfortable especially not $1000 comfortable I will never shop there again and neither will my family He lost out on a lot of business especially since I'm moving and need a living room set and some furniture pieces for my room Save yourself the time and agony and don't go there The ""amazing deals"" they offer are all smoke and mirrors."
3965,"You can not give zero stars on Yelp but Zero is the reality This is a review only for our student field trip booking experience Warning--- don't do it This had to be the worse experience of my 15 years of teaching in the classroom and booking field trips There was one issue after another ranging from no calls back to rude staff to hang ups to transfer after transfer to answering machine to dial tone  ARGHHH and frustration abound They now make all teachers wanting a Title One field trip to go to a worthless class No exceptions even by experienced educators  I mean really A class on how to learn how to go on a field trip ""ReallyTIMES2"" This is is a slap in the face for educators It would take too long to explain all the problems we had but rest assured it was the worse customer service in the world trying to book our field trip It took us three months to finally close the deal There is absolutely no excuse for this You would think in this economy they would be happy for our business One phone call had me hanging up on the woman because she was so horribly rude I will update the review after the trip which I sure hope goes better than the entire ugly experience of booking it We will never be going here again."
2214,Love their Bobby sandwich Have to stop here everytime we visit So yummy.
3644,"We were in town visiting the outlet stores and decided to stop after seeing the yelp reviews We ordered for six and were surprised when everyone noticed something a little off on the food  All the refried beans had a very strong sour taste like vinegar We told the girl working there and she confirmed that the beans had soured At first she told us it was lime juice in the beans She went and talked to the owner and they threw the beans out By this time everyone was worried about getting sick The girl tried refunding only the equivalent of what the beans would cost I reminded her that there were also beans inside the burritos and in the nachos The owner actually refunded our money and we left  His explanation I've been doing this since 1991 and sometimes things happen  It might be that the beans were bad when we got them Maybe a ""sorry about that"" would have been better  Too bad because the part we did eat before the spoiled beans was pretty good."
4399,Good food if you can get attention One guy that works there pays no attention to the register and after 10 min waiting LOOKING at him just staring at the computer behind the bar made me decide I'll wait and maybe next time I go for a haircut they will be paying attention :(.
1833,I spontaneously went to China City Super Buffet with the intention of trying something new  Ironically the experience that I received was far from what I was looking forAfter finding this location in the hood I was promptly seated and went for my first tour of the buffet  After discovering that the first plate was not clean I grabbed another and loaded up on some sushi  It wasn't great sushi but it wasn't bad either it just didn't taste that fresh  On my second trip I grabbed some mixed rice orange chicken beef and some cooked shrimp (with the head on)  Everything was quite lukewarmFortunately I was still using the chopsticks that I used for my sushi as I sifted my way through the rice  Then I found the special surprise of the day in my rice: AN INSECT LEGNow I'll gladly admit that I'm not an expert when it comes to bugs  I've seen plenty in my day from cockroaches to bees and even crickets  So I can't say for sure which kind of insect that this leg came from but I am absolutely sure that it didn't belong in my food  After discreetly taking pictures I called for the manager and showed her the evidence  She tried to act like the two-jointed leg was a black thread as she held it up to her black shirt  Good try lady- I may look dumb but I am not stupidLong story short I will not return and only recommend this place if you are really open to wanting any kind of extra protein in your diet  Two photos of the leg are attached for your viewing pleasure.
4847,The place looked interesting thought Id give it a try bad idea  Service is average - Food NOT good  Burger was dry flavor bland and on horrible bread  Even didnt like the fries really The price of the burgers a bit high  Best burger Ive had in town is the GRIND costs $12 bad burgers should be $7-8.
396,Best Pho ever The broth is Pholicious No need to go anywhere else.
769,Great place for funfooddrink and entertainment and the prices are reasonable They provide a free shuttle service Lots of TV's for all games even on Sunday NFL Outside fire pit  when chilly outside with misters when it's hot This is a sports bar not a fancy restaurant but the food is good and they always have specials on food and drink plus a reverse happy hourManagement keeps this place clean and neat with great help from staff and servers.
4346,Poor service incredibly slow ticket times two order mess-ups and a FREEZING cold dining room made for a horrible lunch experience  Took thirty minutes for our app to come out  Had to ask for lemons for our tea three times before the waitress remembered to bring them out  When our lunch entrees arrived my friend's bacon cheeseburger which she ordered with Swiss cheese (she originally wanted American which is still listed as an option on the menu but which they no longer carry according to the server) was topped with cheddar instead  She decided to tough it out until she realized the bun was soaking wet (gross)  That got sent back  My other friend's food came ten minutes after the rest of us recieved our entrees due to a kitchen error  I had the balsalmic dressing with my salad and I highly suggest you stay away from thattastes like a mess of straight vinegar and peppercorns  And wear a sweater  AZ is hot and all but that doesn't mean the AC needs to be turned down to 40*.
849,"Pure and utter dog poop Asked for an ""Anaheim Scramble"" with some orange juice The cashier told me they didn't have juice I asked if they were out She replied no and that she even thought it was weird they didn't carry any juice being a breakfast place My scramble comes out and the waitress who brings it to me looks at it oddly before serving it to me I ask her why she looked at it that way she said no reason I insisted there would be some reason to eye my eggs like that She showed me the eggs were under cooked and runny and returned it to the kitchenWhat she brought back was some sort of Frankenstein's monster of a scramble with stale toast  See picture for further reference."
202,Best black bean burger I ever had and the fried pickles were very interesting.
3659,I went to dinner here on 10/28/2010 What attracted me was the reputation the restaurant had for it's authentic food and the Mariachi Trio music on Thursday night  What a disappointment it was  The steak fajitas came out and they were served as a pile of mostly onions and some green peppers  There was hardly any steak in the pile and what I did find had very little seasoning and was tough definitely not top sirloinWe were also served chips and salsa  which were OK nothing specialSince we were still hungry after eating the fajitas we ordered sopapillasThey came out and again what a disappointment Hardly any flavor to them and very little sugar coating on the outside The honey syrup didn't come in a serving decanter but instead in cheap peel open packages you would find at a fast food restaurant As I looked around i thought the only people that would eat here are tourists(who will never come back) and people who don't know what authentic mexican food tastes like.
1641,We fell in love with OHSO immediately and we've been coming to OHSO regularly for some time with our kids for their $10 beer brunch on the weekends I love their breakfast burrito on the beer brunch menu On the regular menu my favorite is the brisket burger with a pitcher of something local or regionalOHSO is a great example of a locally owned restaurant supporting local breweries (while working on their own) and other local community organizations.
4845,"I have never encountered such horrible customer service I have very long hair and have been thinking about cutting about 10 inches off and before I did wanted to try out a wig to make sure I wouldn't hate the short look on me I went into wig land hoping to find a wig I could test out for a couple of weeks but the lady working said I couldn't try on most of the wigs because my hair was too long So when I asked what I could try on and told her my reason for wig shopping she told me I couldn't try on anything and that her wigs are ""not for play"" and if I want to cut my hair to just cut it Even after I tried to explain that I wanted to buy a wig she just keep saying I couldn't try on anything She was extremely rude and I would never recommend this store to anyone."
4704,It's a Friday at midnight The Vig Uptown has 4 stars on YelpHOW COME THERE'S NO ONE HERE Where is everyone Why is it so quiet I was very confused- it looks like a place where there should be a ton of people But no empty Sad.
1886,I'm not an expert on New Orleans seafood by any means but the mixed seafood grill was very good  Everything was cooked perfectly which is quite a trick especially with the variety of meats on the skewer  I would have saved some for leftovers but my hotel room doesn't have refrigerator or microwave :(The only thing I could have wished for is wild Pacific salmon instead of the Atlantic salmon but I guess that would make it less authenticI dined on the patio so I didn't much of a feel for the ambience inside but it did seem rather loud as I passed through the lobby.
1832,I've driven by this place numerous times and finally decided to stop in and see what the heck was going on in there  I had heard they had food to go or something like that  I discovered they had a few tables and I could eat in so I ordered the turkey meatloaf with side of mashed sweet potatoes and a side of garlic kale  Faithful Companion had a salmon cake with a side of garlic kale and a side of butternut squash chunksThe food was very fresh and well prepared  All the veggies were al dente and seasoned just enough  The two entrees were also very well done and neither left any oily residual on our plates  And all of that for 12 bucks and change Wow I'm going back as soon as I get hungry again maybe tonight about 3AM.
4787,"REI you had such a good thing goingwhy oh whySometimes an event lives great because it offers so much more than it intends When it's a store putting it on for the sake of it's customers (and I'd like to think as a thank you for loyalty) it goes far beyond a vehicle for making a saleWe have loved the Garage Sale that this location put on for so very long We would get in line at 5am with the other die hards and laugh at the people waking up in their sleeping bags (while secretly wishing that we had the cojones to do the same since they were going to get the VERY best deals) A couple years running Krispy Kreme came across the street with boxes of donuts to cheer our early morning waitBut it was the people that made it We'd hang out in the early morning hours with other outdoor enthusiasts trading stories and secrets about local trails lakes and camping sitesand then with nervous excitement we'd charge into the parking lot like mad men snatching up sleeping bags and hiking shoes for pennies on the dollar thanking the REI gods that we the chosen few the members would have such an opportunity to feed our equipment cravings at unheard of pricesFlash forward to yesterdayI evidently missed the memo that the ""new and improved"" garage sale was happening in the store up in the clinic room Clutching my 20% off coupon we made our way through the crowded parking lot J with visions of using it for a new bike seat while I ready to fight him for a chance to restock my hiking sock drawer at 20% savings We walked in to signs advertising the garage sale and  a very long line of people waiting to go up stairs for their finds of the year J got in line and I went to hunt for new feet cushions Several minutes later he found me to let me know that he had to get out of line to get tickets for the sale but was assured that it was a 30 minute wait and he was going to  the bike department until our numbers were calledI was dubiousthe line looked like it was for an E-ticket ride at Disneyland and the people in it weren't looking any happier than if it was 98¬∫ with screaming kids at said park Long story shortit was 2 full hours before we were called to that upstairs secret clubhouse Once there we were told we had a very generous 10 minutes to shopwe picked up a few things set them down in frustration when neither of us could get to the clothes and walked out of the store empty handedREI management this is an epic fail in my opinion You turned a wonderful community event into a vehicle to hold your members hostage in hopes of their making full price purchases while waiting for a disappointing chance to make the killer buy that we dreamed yearly aboutand worse yet you didn't even make the sale that we intendedyou didn't sell the $53 bike seat you didn't sell the $1795 socks but you did manage to piss off a couple of members who have been on your roster for 25 yearsSometimes a sales event is more than the sum of the profits or in this case the decluttering of the returns bin Sometimes it's a way to show your customers the loyalty they've shown you we heard repeatedly that this was much easier on the employees and management than the old parking lot sale This was much harder on us as consumers and so unsatisfying to wait two hours for a 10 minute opportunity The parking lot sale was  one day of chaos for the employees a couple times a yearis that too much to ask from a store that we've been loyal too for half our lives."
757,Awesome view and great place for a wedding My friends got married up in the church at the top of the hill and we had a great picnic table dinner served by the fire they made Open bar friendly staffwas fabulous experienceOnly downfall is wish the town stayed open later.
3942,I am a big fan of locally owned and operated family type places But this one is over rated over priced and the food leaves much to be desiredFrom the too busy to acknowledge you at the door to the self absorbed wait staff overall disappointingAnd to think I went twice in hopes it was just a bad dayNope Just a bad placeAlthough it looks like a usual for the hangover crowd.
523,What's with long lines to get breakfast Very disappointing.
2944,I love this subway It's clean fast and I always leave happy Krystal who is also the manager is always sooo friendly Ex: I told her I was dieting and she gave me all kinds of tips She removed some of my bread  loaded up on  my fav veggies no cheese and also gave me light mayo packets so I could measure exact calories I always appreciate great customer service I am loyal to this particular subway just because of that.
843,My husband and I went to Grimaldi's last night and there was a bit of a wait for a table so we grabbed two seats at the bar After the bartender Hannah talked to us we decided to stay there to eat She was super attentive and really friendly and the bar was actually more quiet than the main restaurant We had a bottle of the Layer Cake Primitivo shared a salad and had a pizza with red peppers and meatballs The pizza (as always) was cooked perfect Love their thin crust and fresh mozarella The manager heard that we had a young baby at home so he came over to talk about his kids and ours with us He even comped our dessert Both he and the bartender were really engaging and fun to talk to without being overbearing They made our experience a wonderful night out--which is important when you only get one a week We've been there with a big group as well and got our own little dining room that felt like we were all together at someone's home (without having to have someone cook or pick up).
1143,I love coming to this place The food is delicious and alway consistent If your lucky enough to get a table out side u will have the pleasure of watching the private plans take off and land Hopefully soon they will be able to expand so it isn't so crowed Best breakfast spot in C-town However the service isn't the best But I've had worse at other Chandler hot spots.
2250,Gotta love the Sno BallsI have never been to New Orleans during the warm months - all my trips have been late October - early January - so I have never tried a Sno Ball in it's natural habitatThat saidI have a bunch of NOLA friends - and they all assure me this is the real deal While I have to take their word on the authenticity for now - my own taste buds tell me this is GREATSure - most of the flavors and the concept is similar to a snow cone But the ice is shaved so much finer - it's an amazing texture - not at all grainy  Really like the Rocky Mountain snow I grew up with in northern New MexicoOver 50 flavors to choose from - check out the website or better yet - go in and get one (or 5)Great for kids 2-92.
4444,A married man drives up in a shiny mercedes Benz he's dressed nice and ready to unwind from a hard day at work  He walks right in and directly to the left he knows where he's going: to a booth to watch an adult movie  he selects which one he wants to see and puts his money in  this is what we call an adult arcade  He's playing monkey balls the adult version  The other people walking in just think its a sex shoplube adult toys leather and videos  I went in there with my boyfriend one time and that was the last time  This place gave me the creeps  Walking around the arcade and knowing that there wasn't just one person in the booths guess they were just playing a two player fighting gameI try to keep thinking that to myselfremembering it is just an adult arcade and shoppe  If you're going there for the innocent thrill of buying items to make your love life betteryou're in the right place  Just don't play in the arcadeit's not the kind you're used to as a kid lol  And of course you can't go in without buying somethingI bought a key chain  :p.
4688,Would give them a zero star but can't  Pizza is at a two starbuffalo wings were okay Service was a 2 out of 10 ten being the highest Front desk guy was rude STAY AWAY.
2345,"This place is by far my favorite Mexican restaurant in Scottsdale They have a great wait staff great food and great drinks You cant go wrong here My favorite are the Tinga Chicken Tacos and I like to wash it down with a Cadillac Margarita If I'm with my girlfriend we like to share the ""Gigante"" with is a 56 ounce margarita for $20 I take all my friends here who come to visit."
3460,"These are horrible pharmacy people they would not fill a pain prescription for my dog who has cancer and needs his meds every 72 hours Manager even got involved and still would not fill it even though I have been to other CVS pharmacy's in Tempe near my work Would not call other pharmacy nor my vet to do her ""research"" Ended up having to drive 60 miles round trip to Tempe to get it filled and spent over 3 hours  My dog suffered horribly that day and night because it takes 8 hours to kick in which I told the pharmacist and almost had to make the decision to put him down Luckily this morning because of the great Tempe location he is feeling better But all could have been avoided if the lady pharmacist at this location filled my dog's prescription and did her ""research""."
3274,Stopped in here today and figured I would give it a try as I pass it all the time First thing is the smoking section is right in front of the place so you have to walk through it to get inside I get splitting migraines from cigarette smoke so I had to hold my breath once in side there was a sign saying please seat your self  so we did and figured they did not see us come in because it took for ever to get service the booth was dirty and the window sill had a inch layer of dust with some old fries and about five dead flies on it it took forever for the food to come which is odd because there was only five people in the place and three outside smoking the food was nothing to brag about just plain bleh Not sure how they stay in business must have cheap drink on the lounge side and if you are wasted you don't care about the rest place should shut down.
77,The antithesis of Starbucksindependent coffee shop at its finest  Bungalow with slacker types on Macs board games and dudes with dreadlocks on their fourth quadruple espresso latte for the day (and it is only 1:30 pm)  Americano was unbelievably smooth made me swear off corporate coffee for almost a week (until I had no choice).
4988,"I went to the grand opening of the new location of Primp and Blow with high hopes They sent me an e-mail for the kick off event advertising free eyebrow waxing and make-up applications The e-mail was quite timely because I was in need of having my eyebrows waxed When I got there about 5:20pm they seemed quite busy and disorganized Which honestly I can understand for a grand opening so I tried to cut them a little slack When I asked the girl at the front desk about eyebrow waxing she seemed unsure what I was talking about said she would write down my name and ask that I should check back with her in 10-15 minutes When I checked back the next girl I talked to had put me on the list and said it would be about 15 minutes to just come and check back at the desk After another 15 minutes I checked back and got the same response This happened a few times I finally was taken back to have my eyebrows waxed around 6:20pm Yes an hour after I got there Thnakfully they had some yummy food and good music for the grand opening so still trying to give them the benefit of the doubt here The girl that took me back never introduced herself so I do not know the name of the person I am reviewing At the very beginning I explained to her my brows are very simple I just do a little underneath and a little in between my brows I told her I didn't need shaping just keep the shape I have and clean up the hair underneath my brow The first thing she does is put wax ABOVE my eyebrow As you know once wax is applied there is only one way it is coming off :-( So she waxed the top of one brow even though I specifiaclly told her just underneath and between Yikes but can't undo it nowThen she does between and underneath does a quick pluck of a few strays and says she is done Um okI've never had them not hand me a mirror when they are done bad sign So I hop up to look in the mirror only to find out that she went way thinner than the natural shape of my brows Way thinner than I ever go When I mention this to her she say ""wow and I never shape I just follow the line of the brow"" Wellthat's not true because mine are now scary thin =( Nothing I can do to get them back but just wait And hope they grow back in the way I used to have them So while I was clearly not happy with my thin brows (even though I am still trying as best I can to be nice at this point) I didn't even receive an apology from her Nothing I was very disappointed in my experience here and will not be returning to have anything waxed in the futureOn a side note a few friends went that night for blowouts and make-up applications They were split A couple liked their hair and not their make-up a couple liked their make-up and not their hair And one friend left nearly in tears because she hated both her hair and make-up so much Not so great for opening night when you are trying to do your best to get return customers."
3163,My husband and I went to Wingstop for our first time tonight and boy do we regret it The wings and fries were horrible and the sauce left a nasty taste on our mouths We had higher hopes for this place and we are not going back again.
775,Cambodian food is so good and I'm very happy to see a restaurant is available in Phoenix now  Otherwise I'd have to visit California   The soup basil stir fry papaya salad and lemongrass chicken are all good choices here.
4404,Do not go to this place if you are hungry  I am very disappointed with this Arcadia Farms  I have never had such a horrible experience at one location  Some friends and I went here for breakfast on a Sunday only to find out that they stopped serving breakfast at 11 am  This doesn't make sense  We decided that we would stay for  lunch  I decided to split the California Turkey Club with the potato salad  with a friend  After 45 minutes later we finally got our food  The server did stop to tell us that the kitchen was behind but made no offer if we would like some bread to pass the time  The California Turkey Club was very disappointing  It was all bread and nothing in the middle  Very little turkey on this sandwich  I wish the server would have said how the potato said was made  It was covered in mayo which did not sit well with our stomachs  I have been to Arcadia Farms before for breakfast and had an amazing entree and service  This time the food and service were really lacking  We received our bill and noticed that we got charged $3 for splitting our plates  I did not see this on the menu or  the server did not mention to us when we placed the order  $3 for a can of Diet Coke  Why are you upcharging for a can of soda  I love supporting local places but this place has lost a customer.
4408,One year ago I would have rated the place a four out of five  Since that time the staff has gone straight to crap  Front desk girls are typically either rude or indifferent and some of the trainers are jerks  Also as another individual mentioned the towels they switched to are cheap and wouldn't dry off a 90 pound female  The showers and men's locker room have always been relatively gross so that hasn't gotten worse over the last 12 months but it hasn't gotten better either  After they went to the 1999/month plan (around the first of the year) they completely oversold their membership  So not only is it impossible to maneuver the locker room it is also now impossible to manuever the weight room  Not to mention if you plan on incorporating bench work or squats into your workout you can count on waiting for a bench or the SINGLE squat rackLastly the clientele of this gym is weak  I've never seen so many fake hardos in my life  Guys wearing sunglasses while they work out etc etcAnyway the last straw was today when I had to wait for a locker to open up  You must be kidding me Gold's Gym  Cancelled this afternoon and will be taking my money to Lifetime.
2554,"This place is awesome This is the first Fogo I've been to but I've spent some time in Brazil and have had ""real"" BBQ As with most Brazilian BBQ places the strategy is to stay away from the salad bar and just load up on meat Having said that their salad bar is very fresh and is loaded with some pretty interesting items The asparagus was cooked perfectly (something I need with beef for some reason) One of the drawbacks from places like this is overcooked meat I prefer Medium rare to rare for high quality beef and the servers are more than willing to find you steaks that are cooked to your liking You're not going to get anything too exotic to choose from like you would in Braziliechicken hearts but it's a nice place in a convenient location Of course this is in Scottsdale so you know it's more upscale than it probably needs to be and that's fine with me."
3150,This restaurant has been shut down before I could eat their delicious food Alerting Yelp management.
1115,Went in here without knowing much about cigars and the person working was very helpful and pointed us to affordable delicious cigars  The shop itself is very nice and brand new and features a bar and a room to smoke in as well with large TVs  Great place.
3597,"I have been trying to get in to have the show dog test done It is hard for me to do so because of my schedule Tonight I was able to get out of work at 7 I went straight to the Tempe location with my running shoes in hand First no one even acknowledged me for about 20 minutes then when I finally do get acknowledged the sales person says that they cannot perform the shoe dog test on me because it was close to closing time and there were two people ahead of me It was 7:30 pm on Feb 162013 I asked if they could make an exception because I had just gotten out of work and didn't know when I would be able to cone back I said I needed the shoes by tomorrow She said "" Well we can do a quick analysis""  I told her to forget it I need a good test because I'll be running in a marathon I would've bought 3 pairs of shoes and possibly more running gear and clothes I said forget it I'll go to another store She just smiled and said ""Ok"" I was VERY disappointed I will take my business elsewhere then Seems the employees were more about getting out of work on time than making money."
544,We had my grandmother go to Advanced Health Care of Scottsdale and learned that this is the most unprofessional place it's a complete joke They have no idea what they are doing they over medicate their patients and can't even keep track of their patients They beyond over medicated my grandmother She was completely out of it didn't remember anything was very aggressive was not her sweet loving self at all We continued to tell them that she isn't herself and something is wrong They completely ignored us continuously and even told us she has Alzheimer's No sorry you do not just get acute Alzheimer's in a week What a joke Come to find out that the doctor had prescribed her Valium talk about making a sane person crazy She was hallucinating out of her mind and they couldn't figure out it was the valium My family knew right away once we found out they were giving her valium They even had us hire a home health person to come in their facility and take care of her at night (basically do their job) So here we are paying all this money for extra care when they were the ones making her this way My aunt who is a doctor found out that she was on valium and told the head nurse as medical power of attorney for my grandmother she wanted the valium stopped immediately Did they stop it Nope They told her they did and then continued to give it to her You hope to have your loved ones in a place that they are being taken care of properly and this is not the place Overall this place is a complete joke and I would NEVER send another person I know there.
2206,In a word pathetic I can only comment on the brunch they presented on Sunday  Took a relative visiting from New England that wanted to eat at a Beau MacMilan restaurant and boy was it disappointing Here's the low lights:1 Menu You can pay a lot of money for the brunch or a lot more money on top of brunch to have an entre No option available just to order an entre Already strange 2 Selection Seems like whatever was left in the kitchen over the weekend turns into brunch Maybe Kitchen Confidential  was right Rice and miso soup in the left corner with a small bowl of hummus (no pita) in the right corner Omelettes on the west side Greek orzo on the east side  If you are suffering from an identity crisis you may as well serve up some classics (roast beef or ham with eggs) and take the hit that you are boring 3 Service Abysmal Our smarmy French server Daniel had an excuse for everything that he failed to deliver After 10 minutes of waiting for soy sauce for the white rice I walked into the kitchen myself and within 20 seconds came back with soy sauce Just a thought but when you take a plate with utensils it would be wise to replace them  I can steal them from the next table over myself (which is what he did) Unlimited sparkling wine comes with the buffet if you could get a refill Eventually we tasked one of   the more helpful bussing staff to fill in where the server failed which was at nearly every task and its a buffet  4 Management At one time the  manager made a stroll through the dining hall but never stopped at a single table to ask how things are going  Probably because he already knew His major accomplishment was getting more Coronas from downstairs 5 Bill Kids under 7 eat free until the bill shows up Now I've got to go track down the non existent server to dispute the billIn the end someone spent millions of dollars to build a beautiful restaurant on the side of Camelback Mountain only to fill it with unqualified staff to create sour memories for eager out of towers but at least it's expensive Highlights the table bussing staff and valet Both very nice and hard working.
3165,Very disappointing bland food burnt pizza crust Only reason we didn't walk out was the lovely food server Vagana Will not go again the end of a family tradition Time to pick a new italian restaurant for next year.
2853,Absolutely love the food that Switch has to offer me I don't think I've ever tried something on the menu that I wasn't absolutely satisfied with Oh wait I remember one thing their martini but I'm pretty sure I'm just not a martini drinker so that's why I didn't like itI love that they have monthly specials and I make an effort to try them out once a month Their daily $3 drink specials is so awesome The service has always been good to meIf you haven't checked out Switch yet then you are for sure missing out so get your butt over there and dig in.
3534,Dingy dining room poor rushed sevrice Lobster bisque not fresh at all Chopped salad was all wilted as if it had been plated hours ago and then dressed All the veggies were wilted Chicken dish was rubbery served with overcooked broccoli and 2 dull potato wedges Quite pricey at $24 for a 6-7 ounce  chix breast Even the bread was subpar It was  torn pieces of ital bread not terribly fresh Being used to superior italian food in NYC and LA this place will never see me again.
110,This place is great Wide open spaces and wholesome food that is more palatable than most For the record--Any place that offers whole wheat substitutes is more than just alright in my book--and The Pita Jungle doesI ordered a Veggie Garden Wrap which consists of zucchini broccoli cauliflower eggplant yellow squash carrots onions tomatoes brown rice mixed beans ginger herbs and garlicon a whole wheat pita of course Based on the price of about $7 I assumed it would be of modest portions but I was only able to eat one half Bravo Pita Jungle you have my heart.
1281,I'm amazed at how friendly everyone here at Liberty Market is Everytime I come here the staff are all so happy and friendly The Liberty Potatoes are the BEST potatoes I've ever tasted The quesadilla is amazing also.
1023,closed.
566,"There are way to many amazing places to go to Bandera  When calling in to make a reservation I was informed ""they don't do that"" when asked what their corkage fee was  The place had a normal busy Saturday night crowd but it seemed there staff was not trained for that  We had multiple servers where we had to ask for menu's silverware drinks & plates At one point even stopping a cookThe food was ehh and no I would not go back  Because like I said before there are way to many amazing places in the valley to go here."
4966,$13 for a bland large cheesesteak $13 for a bland large cheesesteak with 5 pieces of mushrooms that we paid extra for $13 for a bland large cheesesteak that we ordered with fries -- we got about 10 pieces for that $3Absolute and utter rip off Semi-friendly cashier who seemed hell bent on rushing us through our order even though there was NO ONE BEHIND USNONEVEREVERagain EVERIf I could give this place zero stars and burn it down in the process I would It was shiteous Absolutely shiteousAm I making myself clear I think I am.
527,I enjoy eating at Grotto Cafe several times a week I like the Iced Coffee Their salads are very tasty and always look so good i have tried the Monterey the Southwestern and their new Eggless Cesar Salad which is my new favoriteThe Grotto Cafe has great employees who work very hard to make their customers happy.
4796,This place is closed and therefore crushed my soul RIP Cinnabon I looked all over for this place only to find that it was permanently closed :(.
1630,Every time I am in Scottsdale I come in here at least once The food is fantastic and the drinks are great too I love the space & the dark wood beams against a light wall w/ dim lighting make it a spot for any occasion The staff is very friendly & accommodating & they will ensure you enjoy your visit I HIGHLY recommend the Chopped Salad & the duck (if available) but all the food is wonderful I highly recommend to anyone.
4008,Says they have 24hr automated postal service Perhaps they do but you would have to make it past the locked doors after hours to find out Staff is typical USPSrude don't care attitude and doing as little as possible to be helpful I bet they wonder why the USPS loses an approximated $25 MILLION dollars a day I hope the USPS goes BANKRUPT and every single one of them lose their job.
107,Sorry folks this isn't working  We tried a variety of dishes from the menu and nothing was more than meh  Barely there uninspired and overpriced for quality and quantity  Plus our server was one of those folks that maybe should be working in computers not hospitality  Beautiful patio too bad the food doesn't measure up  That said we tried Barrio Cafe at the airport and had a rockin' meal with great albeit slightly wack service  Quality control folks or maybe the Scottsdale crowd just doesn't know the difference :).
217,"One of the best sub shops hands down Love the way they steam the subs make them taste freaking deliciousReally there isn't any sub on the menu you can't go wrong with Average prices and the ""Welcome to Firehouse"" never gets oldGive it a go and head to Firehouse."
3874,This was not my first time at this restaurant but it was my last  The food did look appealing and the waiters were friendly but lost my appetite shortly after seeing a COCKROACH in the dessert section  After bringing it to the attention of workers who laughed during and after disposing of it I did pay the check in full and left  No apologies or excuses were made which left me to believe this was not the first incident like this.
2636,A native San Franciscan in Arizona for grad school I have searched far and wide for a place comparable my beloved Axis and Ritual cafes At Lux I found my home at a place with the best desserts in the desert.
1207,"I continue to go to this location because its the closest to my home however today is my last day there There is an employee who is so RUDE (she refused to give me her name) I asked her for a marker and she said she didn't have one She's always on the very far left SHE'S SUCH A B***** So then I said ""it's a post office and you don't have a marker"" So then I asked the sweet looking employee next to her for a marker and she was happy to lend it to me So then I come back to other this rude employee and told her ""you really couldn't just ask someone for a marker"" ""How hard was that""  I asked to speak to a manager and want to know what the manager said to me She said ""do not disrespect my employee"" OMG Anyway before with the white lady on the very very far left she has short hair She's such a bitch."
562,I'm pretty sure this is the best pizza I have ever had  We split the bruschetta plank which was good nothing spectacular and the garlic pizza  The crust was cooked perfectly thin and had delicious flavor  The ambiance was very nice as well.
2497,What A cultural store in the state of Arizona You mean one besides the touristy Native American ones on every cornerIndeed you heard me correctly For the longest time I never even knew this store existed It is somewhat hidden located in the courtyard next to/behind Fatburger on MillI have been in there twice and I was amazed within the first 10 seconds the first time I went in This shop is very unique very interesting They have stuff from many different countries the man will tell you that when you walk in He will also give you a tour of the small store I got one both times I went it was great I remember in particular the little things carved out of nuts it's weird yet utterly amazing They have so many different things jewely purses beads rings trinkets doo-dads thingamagigs etc But seriously it's great The next thing I am going to get there is some kind of Elephant purse/handbagAbsolutely a great place to stop by if you are near Mill Ave Very interesting and an awesome place for those of us in in the Valley that actually admire Culture.
1445,well been going here for yearsstill go at least 2 or 3 times a monthmy youngest son is in the armyand ever time he is in town the first place he wants to go is rolando'sand the last place he goes when leaving town is rolandosalways the same carne asada burritode carne asada tacos are great toif and when you go hereand if you dont try it you losetry something carne asadaand if you do not like it i would have to say do not ever order carne asada any where because you just dont like carne asada yes it looks like a dumpbut guess what they made the deans list the last two times they went therech 5.
1425,This has always been one of our go too restaurants  On our last visit as we were enjoying the last bit of a bottle of wine  Servers picked up 1/2 full water glasses and swarmed our table they wanted us out  we were a party of 4 had enjoyed our dinner and we were just finishing up  This was just flat out rude and very disappointing  Since when should you feel rushed to finish your bottle of wine  Not sure we will go back  I expect great service  There are plenty of great restaurants here in Scottsdale.
4009,We have an issue with All Stars Sports Bar Make that twoFirstly just because you are one of the few liquor licensees within the airport it doesn't give you permission to stock only the cruddiest of beers Coors Bud Light and Sam Adams Oh pleaseSecondly the Wendy's fast food next door serves equal or better food than All Stars for half the price and twice the efficiencySo here's how I came to the above two conclusionsSunday early evening at PHX It has been a long week in AZ and I desperately wanted a beer and dinner before getting on the planeJust like when you're at any sports venue I do expect to pay through the nose for that beer at the airport But given my recent experiences that beer does NOT have to be a cruddy mass commercial brand Take note PHX - tiny little PDX serves local micro brew brands right at the gate So does SFO That is supporting local businesses and leaving your visitors with a wonderful last impressionNext the food My expectations were low I'm totally cool with burgers hot dogs and fries But when the burger patty came out it honestly looked like a fast food burger vs something I'm paying $15 for That didn't bode well given there were plenty of fast food options I could have gone withThe server was nice enough but not very efficient She was holding my plastic silverware (oh yes everything is served on plastic) WHILE talking to another customer I was puzzledBottom line: DON'T EAT HERE Grab a to-go from the fast food or sandwich places If you must have a beer then go ahead it's more about the experience of chatting with fellow travelers vs getting an interesting beer.
4011,I am honestly shocked by the good reviews but I guess I am glad others have a better experience hereHadn't been to this location in over 3 years due to mediocre service and food Went today to see if anything has changed NopeGave us tots instead of fries Made the Slush Floats were ordered weird it's suppose to be a slush with ice cream inside UNBLENDED If this is how they make them now um alright They did not add my mom's petezel dog despite telling them the order repeatedly and when we pushed the button to correct this we were met with nothing but some rude guy Pretzel dogs with bacon and cheese are suppose to have bacon bits They gave us a big ole slice of bacon across the dog Makes it harder to eat Why I am not surprised that they are too lazy to cut up the bacon slices like in the pictureGoodbye forever Sonic.
2210,Just had a wonderful lunch at The Herb Box in DC RanchThe atmosphere is hip trendy and casual They had a great looking patio that I'm looking forward to sitting in when it gets a bit cooler They did have misters out there though so it's tolerable with the heat   The service was great no complaints at all I had the Turkey Apple Swiss Wrap  Wow it was super yummy   The wrap had bacon bits and cashews in it  They served the wrap with sweet potato chips  I'm not a fan of sweet potatoes but these chips I loved  We couldn't stop there HAD to have a dessert  We debated over everything they had and decided on the Lemon Meringue Pie it was very good and is the perfect size to share  Price was good  I split the bill with another and total came to $25.
1124,You will never have a better sub then eating a sub at Firehouse.
2785,Don't let the outside scare you Hole in the wall type of place but the best darn donuts in town You have to get there early because they are usually out of donuts by 8:30am The Donut Lady is as sweet as her donuts She is there every day but Sundays  I call ahead sometimes for the croissants because those run out first The place looks run down however in this day and age where people are losing their jobs and businesses God bless the Donut Lady for keeping her Making it in America Entrepreneurial Dream alive.
1042,Aaaaamazing~ such an awesome new hang out spot Here are a few highlights:The prices are great I really recommend the happy hour from 1 to 8pmServices was very helpful helping me pick a wine that I would like The guy even let me sample a small amount before I bought a glass- and of course I ended up buying a bottle The decor is beautiful You can write on the chalk wall The only thing I didnt like was the sign out front But there was no way I was going to dock points for that You NEED to try this place.
1615,Lizz just gets it  She knows exactly how to cut and manage my crazy curls and helps me incorporate enough 'edge' to feel current but not out of my comfort zone  Liz has been working her magic on my hair for almost 10 years and every single time I feel like a million bucks  But it gets better  Not only is her technical skill fantastic Lizz is truly one of the nicest people I know  Not to mention a fashion goddess  5 very enthusiastic stars for this wonderful woman and stylist.
906,One of my favorite spots in Phoenix The service is always excellent and the bruschetta is delicious Some favorite bruschetta choices are Brie & Apples with Fig Spread Tomato Jam & Fresh Sheeps Milk Cheese and Burrata Bacon Arugula & Tomato Happy hour offers $5 wines although ends early at 5pm.
2059,I've never had a bad meal here  It can get crowded once you taste the food you will see why  We love the entire appetizer menu  You could also try the vodka penne de parmiaeverything is so good  Last time we went the waitress told us that it is ALL DAY EVERY DAY happy hour from now on   YES  I wish we lived close  We would be here all the time.
2717,After being in Texas for the past few months coming back here flooded my tongue with so many great memories The egg rolls were pure bliss just as i remembered The vermicelli with beef and shrimp paste was very good They never cease to amaze me.
4258,Workers are always in terrible mood They are rude and negative I prefer to go to 19801 N 59th Ave Glendale AZ.
188,I love everything about crescent ballroom and I wish every band in phoenix came through here Seriously Everything is great Perfect Awesome I love crescent.
4543,I can't rate this place because it's not there they moved miles down the road to a different location who knows how long ago  yelp won't let me give zero stars for a non-existent place.
223,If I was stoned out of my mind This place would be the bomb  But I was not So it wasn't Just a complete disappointment Clean the place up too I feel like I need a tetanus shot after leaving this place Gross.
1116,Great to finally have a high end NIke store in town This store is smaller than Niketown locations in other cities but they pack a lot into the two-story space Most of the square footage is allocated to golf tennis and running but the basketball training and Nike sportswear sections provide ample variety The store carries a majority of the current hot/limited releases and an abundance of color ways of the most popular running basketball and training shoes The clothing selection is great at well and I saw lots of t-shirts shorts jackets etc that I haven't seen elsewhere I'll definitely be a regular at this store.
1212,Great quick mexican food Had ground beef burrito and the ground beef is cooked to order which usually pre-cooked awesome.
303,I love ducking in here for a great glass of wine and some live jazz  The ambiace is cool and classy  The decor has that old world feel  The staff is knowledgeable about their wines and should be so  I have enjoyed the flights they offer better to taste a few at a time  There are so many wines to chose from doing the flights is the idealic way to go to  Enjoy yourself here and be whisked to another world for a few hours you'll be glad you did.
1263,My husband & I went there on a Saturday night after I left a bridal shower we were in town for  I picked up my hubby @ the hoteI for a little bit of a romantic date & found Fleming's on YELP  We arrived about 9pm & sat at the bar  WHAT A DELIGHT  They have an amazing wine list on ipads for you to peruse  Very informative & includes numerous pairing possibilities for every item on the list  The small plates are perfect for a late night bite & more than enough for me as an entree' We paired the dessert with the reccommended port & all I can say is it was heavenly  Our server was absolutely fantastic  Attentive & personable  Such an enjoyable evening we can't wait to go there again.
4599,It may be cool and trendy but the service is not all that great the lobby is kind of dirty and the glass that separates to the bar/restaurant to lobby is kind of dirty the only thing it's really spectaculars  is the pool and then the view from the top of the roof that would be about it.
3132,I will never ever return back here again Over charged me and I almost puked when they brought out my soggy greasy sourdough bread burger out  Plus soda machines were out and still got charged for my disgusting drink I honestly can not believe I didn't just get my money back and walk out If you love burgers hit up  fat burger 3 miles down the road.
2160,I like this Safeway although I don't shop here very much  Prices on household goods and hygiene products are much better at Wal-Mart  The store is always spic and span and the employees are pleasant and helpful   A tip to other shoppers-go early in the morning on weekends to avoid the wasps (ie the Brophy and San Xavier) momsThose ladies in matching sweater sets are crazy drivers with their carts and their Suburbans  in the parking lot  They stop in the aisles and chat with each other oblivious to others trying to get around them.
1896,To start offI am not a big fan of burgers It is about the last thing I will pick as a food option given a choice Well we came here for a burger one night and wow I was impressed The burger was delicious We both got the BBQ Bacon and Cheddar burger The best parts of this burger were the haystack onions and the bacon I got the BBQ sauce on the side The burger was SO juicy The fries were delicious The staff went out of their way to be super friendly and helpful Now if given the choiceI just may pick a burger as an option to eat so long as it is at a Smashburger.
1516,Excellent place Excellent Pizza really really good And the waiters are  all of them so so nice  The owner is frequently there asking if everything is allright  We have gone different days different seasons  always really great.
1065,I absolutely dug this place  A very modern bar with an outside bar and seating area was perfect company to the awesome weather  The decor was pretty cool too  Can't wait to go back  The bar manager was also very welcoming and pleasant.
2722,I have only had good experiences at this location  I went once in the morning with a scheduled appointment for an extensive fasting blood draw  I waited fewer than five minutes in the waiting room and was happy to have a friendly professional tech do my blood draw  There were quite a few people in the waiting room clearly mornings are busy for fasting draws  Just make an appointment and you shouldn't have a problem  I just went again this afternoon for a simple blood draw  I didn't make an appointment just walked in around 3:45 in the afternoon  There were only three people in the waiting room  I got a different tech he was also friendly and professional  I was out the door in under ten minutes  Both times the techs found my vein on the first try with no trouble  Can't ask for much more than friendly staff and quick efficient service.
892,I recently moved to Phoenix and needed to find a new salon after going to the same high-end place in Glendale  Well yelpers the reason I went to Ide Mania was more than just because it was down the street  The great reviews from previous clients lured me to the salon  I had a great haircut from Lettie  She nailed it the first time  I'm going to become a regular  Love the salon and the Aveda products they use  The owner even came up and introduced herself and welcomed me and made me feel at home  Love this place  Thanks for being there Ide Mania  I'll be seeing you.
2952,Very disappointed to find out our favorite pizza joint is now closed this saddens me seeing as how Nick's has the best pizza I have had Don't know why they closed they had the best everything.
1493,Jager my 6 year old bull terrier has been seeing Dr Allen since he was 10 weeks old She is nothing short of wonderful In fact the entire staff is comprised of the most compassionate people I've ever met and they truly care about my dog Over his 6 years mischievous Jager has gotten himself into some pretty precarious situations (run-ins with cacti frolicking in broken glass and of course  attempting to digest shoes and socks) The folks at Indian Bend Animal Hospital always make him good as new with as little pain (and expense) as possibleThe cost is much more reasonable than other similar facilities in the area As a full-time working single [dog] parent I really appreciate that they are open on Wednesdays from 4pm to 8 pm Dr Allen has always been patient even with an annoying first-time dog owner such as myself I can't imagine trusting his care to anyone else.
1176,Lots to do great for people watching huge sports stadium ample parking beautiful fountain.
3742,"The food is ok for takeout but the restaurant service is not so good   Their pizza has a thin crust and the sauce is tangy and the cheese is tasty  The pasta dishes are average but the Penne Alla Vodka needed more sauce and less pasta  The chicken dishes are not recommended  The chicken piccata and marsala are both made with a thin sauce not too much flavor and the chicken is overcooked  The restaurant service is slow  The last time I went it was a Thursday night and the entire restaurant was empty  I was glad because I thought that meant we would have fast service  The waiter took our drink order and then didn't come back with the drinks for almost 10 minutes I think he was folding pizza boxes   And the worst part he didn't bring the wine my mother ordered  When she asked for her wine his response was ""Oh we ran out of that kind of wine""  You think he would have came back to the table sometime in those 10 minutes to tell her that they don't have the wine she ordered  (by the way there were only 3 white wines on the menu)  He never even offered her a different kind of wine    My husband and I both ordered our chicken dishes with sauteed veggies and both our dishes came out with spagetti instead of veggies  They brought the veggies out for my husband but I never got mine The waiter didn't seem to care about anything   Because of the lousy service I would not eat in this restaurant again."
2222,Delicious food large portions- reasonably priced Our waitress Debbie was outstanding Super friendly and gave us great recommendations  We will be back.
4109,"After a day full of meetings I gathered a friend and we headed out to eat some Mexican I had visions of chips/salsa and margaritas We headed to On the Border on Stapley near Baseline but found that this location had closed Egads Then we remembered The Salty Senorita across the street And thus begins the saga ""Hi are you here for happy hour"" We said no but were seated in the bar area anyway At least we got a booth Lucky us huh Joe ""lots of product in his hair"" brought us menus and took our drink orders He was pushing a certain type of Tequila and I took the bait with the stipulation ""on the rocks with salt"" My drink and my friend's water arrived and we ordered The chips and salsa AND our dinners arrived at the same time Really Joe product Chips with the meal FYI chips and salsa here aren't complimentary you have to order and pay for them It was then we noticed ants had taken over our table At first we thought it was just a couple but noooooooo My friend brought the ants to the attention of Joe product and he feigned concern but did not offer to sit us at another table Now my friend is getting annoyed It's hard to enjoy yourself when you are swashing ants off the table Our booth was by a window but we didn't see any influx from the window of ants so we're not sure where they are coming from but they don't stop Friend mentions it a second time and then again with feigned concern he offers to move us to a different table By this time we are almost done eating and I just say let's finish and get the hell out of dodge Our bill comes we pay and my friend asks for the manager Hell he's even younger than Joe Product and looks like he just woke up thus we'll call him Bed Head Bed Head offers to buy us a drink on the house Really That's your solution He said he'd make sure other patrons aren't seated in this area Egads no thanks we just wanted to leave We weren't after free food but the offer of 10% off or some kind of compensation for sharing our entire meal with ants would have been appreciated A free drink Heymaybe one of those $6000 margaritas would have made everything alright As far as the food goes-I had the chicken antchiladas (get it lol) with beans and rice and they were dry I like my enchiladas with oodles of sauce and cheese and these had very little sauce with a little design of sour cream on them My friend had a steak and avocado salad He said it was ok This is a never return place for meAnd a note to Joe Product-chips and salsa should have arrived WITH the drinks and before the mealReflecting back we were there on Earth day so perhaps having ants share our meal was relevantThe margarita gets a 7 out of 10 limes as it was pretty good."
3769,"If it weren't for Yelp making me give it at least 1 Star this place would get ZERO that's right ZERO stars  I have had one bad experience after another with these guys  The pizza is great IF you ever receive it after they tell you it will be a 30-min delivery then you call back after 1hour and they tell you ""the driver is on his way"" then you call back after another half hour and they can not locate your order WTF have you ever heard of a COMPUTER system where you LOG orders when people call  I know what a fantastically high-tech concept but then maybe people would get the pizza they ordered  I am finally writing this review because i just had the same experience at a Domino's in Phoenix ( I live in San Fran and usually order from there) (COULDN'T BELIEVE IT) so this seems to be a widespread problem  I will never again give Domino's my business."
1756,I sure hope my trainer Bill Crawford at Basic Training doesn't follow my reviews  I know I shouldn't be eating Bundt  Cakes but I don't care  These cakes are so moist and scrumptious there is nothing like them  I recently had the blueberry one and it was really tasty  My favorite is red velvet it is rich and has cream cheesy icing on top Seriously if you need to impress thank or present someone with the best cake everthis is the place   I wish I had a wedge now.
1783,"I am a self proclaimed ""Trader Joe Hoe"" lol I don't care what anyone says Trader Joes is the BEST grocery store EVER The Arrowhead location is one of the best I don't see why people are bitching about it I shop at this location on a weekly basis and sure sometimes it's a bit crowded but it's nothing unusual from Walmart Fry's ect I've been a Trader Joeaholic since my days in Los Angeles The store locations are very limited in Phoenix but I'm just so grateful they even have stores out here Trader Joes carries so many foodie friendly products no other grocery store can compare A few of my top TJ products areTrader Joes Meditteranian HummusTrader Joes Dolmas (they even beat restaurant dolmas)Trader Joes GuacamoleTrader Joes Dark Chocolate Covered CranberriesAnd the list can go on and on Trader Joes carries a lot of vegetarian products as well which is pretty nice And for everyone taking stars away from this remarkable place due to the fact that it's not near or in your darn backyard  go take a hike to the nearest preservative packed Walmart and load up on pork grinds or something sheesh Trader Joes also has a raffle if you bring a reuseable bag when you shop They always have had many lanes open when I go and the wait is never long enough for me to remember it being long The cashiers are always really friendly I love Trader Joes Always and forever 5 stars baby :)."
3039,The food here was really bland I'm not sure why there are so many good reviews And yes we tried the pizza muffins Maybe I was expecting a real Italian restaurant but it was extremely casual For example the salad is iceberg and the dressing comes in a to-go container with a lid and they use the red plastic baskets for everything  Not what I had in mind I wouldn't recommend going here if you're looking for great pasta.
299,Great Japanese sushi restaurant  Food is awesome   Just about everything on their large menu is great  They have a lot of other choices other than sushi or seafood  We tend to over order there because everything on the menu looks great  One of these days I am going to try their pork belly.
1518,So we got off the plane checked into our hotel and walked over to Cowboy Ciao for dinner  I was expecting a bar/grill for some reason  But was pleasantly surprised at the upscale fine-dining atmostphereWife and I had the chopped salad  It was very good  I am lactose intolerant so the waitress held out the cheese  I have to say the reviews are right on with this one Delicious  I could totally eat a salad by myselfThen came the pork belly over waffles appetizer  Wow  I've always liked pork bellies being Asian I love fat  This is amazing  Salty smoky fatty deliciousness that melts in your mouth  The waffles just adds to the experience  It's rave in my mouth  :)For my main course I had the pastrami-style short ribs  Jeez  Wow  BIG plate with succulent juicy perfectly cooked short ribs  The meat is smoky tender and falls off the bones  So so goodDefinitely a must-eat in Scottsdale.
4699,We always try to find a local business to support and found good reviews on yelp for Pat's Pizza Plus Geez I have no idea where the good reviews came from The pizza had zero sauce on it it was lukewarm upon pick-up and the salad was being stored on top of the pizza so it was lukewarm as well We won't be trying this place again We'll stick with Spinato's.
3057,"I pride myself on being 'that girl' that tries out every restaurant I come across It's practically a hobby for me For YEARS I kept saying ""I want to go to Cowboy Ciao"" but we never made it Then thankfully the hubs' best friend had a big birthday dinner there so we just HAD to go (Thank you hubs' best friend)I have to say that the service was incredible and the menu was almost overwhelming There were SO many interesting choices but I had to stick to the tried and true chopped salad - everyone and their mother has told me about this salad and I wasn't about to miss out The hubs ordered the Tenderbelly Pork Shank The chopped salad has earned its reputation That thing is de-freaking-licious The Pork Shank dish was fabulous as well but I couldn't get over how great the salad was AND the server always came over to make sure that my wine glass was never empty Seriously can it get any betterFor dessert we ordered the spumoni- I have had better (no offense) but I'm not sure anything served after that salad would have made me happy :)I'm very glad we finally made it to Cowboy Ciao and I look forward to going back - SOON."
1758,"I call this place the ""G"" spot (and I know I'm not alone)  For good reason  It is amazingly delicious some of the best gelato I've ever had Sooooo fricking YUMMYYou can try as many flavors as you want too  So naturally I try no less than every flavor available- haha- (they are more than happy to oblige you) whenever I go  I have gotten pints to take home it's that good  It's a wonder I don't weigh 500 lbs  I try to exercise some self restraint or I probaly would be  But hey isn't gelato supposed to be better for you than ice cream Something about the density so you eat less  )Try it you won't be disappointed  I've only been to the Camelback location although I'm sure they're all good."
1082,Best Quiznos ever Chris and Christine are the 2 nicest managers of any restaurant I have ever been too They are there every Thursday and know what we like and greet us with a smile Quiznos has great food for the price but I go to this place for the service outstanding Thanks Chris and Christine.
4482,Gross This tastes nothing like Mexican food Tastes like they heated up some Jose Ole in the micro Never going back I didn't even pay for this meal and I can't think of one good thing to say about this place.
3541,MY REAL STAR RATING IS 0 STARSI will make this review very quick I wasn't expecting this food to be bursting with flavor and just out of sight delicious I was expecting it to be good average Chinese food I was totally wrong I called in my order for delivery and I ordered sweet and sour chicken and the Hunan beef with an extra egg roll and it came with crab puffs Lets first start off with the sweet and sour chicken It was drenched in sweet and sour sauce and the sauce was way too sweetit had huge chunks of pineapples in it it was soggy and disgusting I prefer to have my sweet and sour sauce on the side The Hunan beef was nasty it was dry and cold and it wasn't spicy at all The veggies were Blah The crab puffs were soggy and the egg rolls They weren't even egg rolls they were more like spring rolls but they still sucked They were horrible The worst egg rolls I ever ate in my life I would prefer Panda Express any day over this place The rice was dry and disgustingThis food made me sick After eating just a couple bites a few minutes later  My body immediately rejected it and it upset my stomach really badly I ended up releasing the food immediately through a bowel movement My body has never reacted like that before It felt like I had rocks in my tummy I felt weak and nausea and I believe I had a very short case of food poisoning Thank God I only ate a few bites  or I probably would have been sick for a couple days My suggestion is that they need to be closed down THEIR FOOD IS HORRIFIC RUN FOR YOUR LIFE IF YOU WANT TO LIVE.
835,Very delicious Naples-style pizza This pizza is serious stuffVera Pizza Napolitana  Crust cheese ingredients--everything was tastyWe had the margharitta first and then we went crazy with Bufalo pizzaThe dough is like eating a cloud and it has the most perfect leopard spotting they cook it in less than two minutes and you can taste the complexity of the wood-fired oven styleThese people are PROSThe food was OUTSTANDING as was the wine selection I felt like my bill was very fair and will definitely be back when I'm in town again.
4041,I used to go into this location as a kid and i loved it everyone was so nice to me and wouldnt hesitate to offer suggestions to help me improve one time they talked me out of buying a new kickstand for my mountain bike because they said it might fall but more recently i feel very ripped off every time i go to landis I was charged 40 bucks for them to install a bike computer(the mounting was already in place) and it took them ten minutes and three zip ties and even more recently i went in for brake work and they said they were going to do an entire brake job and they were going to replace all of the brake cable housings when i got it back i realized that they had only replaced two of them but bumped up to cost of each so it was still the same ammount of money it is sad that this place is now about profit versus genuine customer service and for that reason i will be taking my bike elsewhere (slippery pig etc).
3301,"went at about 3:30 wed trying to beat the crowdonly waited about 10 minutesim glad we didn't wait longer because it definitely wasn't worth waiting formy wife ordered shrimp scampi and had to send it backthe shrimp were tough as rubberi had a 12"" pizza that was no big dealit was nothing special at allthe place is very loudif only the food was as good as the servicewe wont be back."
1564,took my mom grandma and the mrs here for the kickoff to my birthday weekend my family doesn't experience much downtown (they're *gag* scottsdale) so i chose cibo as the perfect introduction to the wonderful cuisine and atmosphere cen pho offers went at 6pm on a friday night and the wait wasn't bad - maybe 15-20 minutes it wasn't too crowded in there so we managed to huddle around the bar and have a drink and chat for a bit before we were seating i had almost forgotten how absolutely charming this place was - you feel very at home inside and it makes for a comfortable meal and dining experiencealthough the service wasn't as good as i expected it to be - our waiter disappeared for long periods of time and didn't check on us very often - it wasn't bad enough to the point of knocking the place down a star first up came the bread and olive oil and when we asked for butter we were denied because they didn't have any what restaurant doesn't have butter we ordered two salads to share - the house salad and the pear salad both were superb the large chunks of parmigiano  on the house salad were tasty as was the balsamic dressing - not too much and not too little - just right we went with two pizzas a red and a white the capriciossa and the other one i forgot the name (it had fontina cheese and pepperoni and it's not on the online menu) the white pizza was definitely  my favorite as i am not a fan of pizza with a lot of toppings i just can't get over how delicious these pizzas are - the crispy wood-fired crust and the cheesiest of cheeses - cooked to perfect we couldn't leave without desert and settled on the nutella and fresca both were to die for i prefered the fruitiness of the fresca to the somewhat overly sweet nutella oh how i heart your pizza cibo no need to try pizzeria bi-crappo you treat me and my taste buds perfectly.
1592,I eat a lot of Asian food (of different sorts)  Asian is actually my go-to cuisine since I have a lot of food allergies  This place deserves a thumbs-down unless you love Americanized Asian  The food was bland breaded and just not worth any money  Next time I'm in Phoenix I definitely won't eat here.
4573,I'll start with the good: the happy hour drinks and the patio are pretty freaking awesome The bad: Ordered the turkey burger because the waitress highly recommended it I love turkey burgers so I was SUPER excited She promised that it was like omg SO good It wasn't It was horrible  I am convinced that they were trying to get rid of soon to be expiring turkey or that she gets some kind of turkey burger bonus The ugly: we ordered nachos for the table  They brought the nachos out and we started eating They came back a few minutes later and said that our plate was actually a special order for another table  THEY TOOK OUR PARTIALLY EATEN PLATE OF NACOS AND GAVE THEM TO THE RIGHT TABLE  I wish I was kidding but thIs actually happened You could tell that our plate had been picked at as well  That has to be the craziest thing that's ever happened to me at a restaurant  None of us could believe that happened  So gross.

1711,We love Peruvian food--the simplicity the flavors and the way it seems to naturally bring friends and family together  We are very happy to have found ContigoThis very unassuming restaurant sits quietly in a suite of a typical suburban strip center  I learned long ago never to discount such places and I encourage others to do the same You will otherwise miss little delights like ContigoWe were greeted upon entering the door as if we were family  It was no surprise to learn that Contigo is a quintessential family business and one of the quintessential American dream--a family leaving their ancestral home in Peru for the promises of the United States and opening a business doing what they do best:  preparing authentic Peruvian food and creating a warm inviting atmosphereand it all begins with the Pisco Sour  This national drink of Peru uses Peruvian Pisco as the base liquor and the addition of lime (or lemon) juice syrup ice egg white and Angostura bitters  DeliciousAll of our usual favorite dishes were present and accounted for on the menu and since we were with our own friends and family we passed plates and tasted everything  We whet our appetites with a nice variety of fresh ceviches which perfectly led us to delicious main courses including Saltados (lomo pollo and mariscos) Tallarin Chaufas and Suprema de Pollo  All exceptionally prepared  All extremely reasonably pricedSo make your way to this nondescript corner of this nondescript strip center in suburban Chandler and enjoy this exceptional gem of a restaurant  It's comfortable casual and very much like you're dining with a warm and welcoming Peruvian family--because you really are.
3511,I have a couple basic guidelines when it comes to restaurants First any place which actively advertises is probably not very good If it doesn't sell itself by word of mouth there's probably a reason Second Indian restaurants which offer a dinner buffet aren't very good I see it as an act of desperation to save a failing business Still I figured I'd give India Oven and their dinner buffet a tryMost things on the buffet were below average Nothing stood out as particularly good and a few things were pretty terrible The worst offender was the rice It was so hard and crunchy it was inedible This problem was compounded by the fact that we waited forever for our naan Naan is thin bread cooked in one of the hottest ovens used for cooking food it takes less than a minute to cook Once we got it though it was pretty decent The tandoori chicken was ok but it had a sour taste to it like it had been sprayed with lime juice and left to soak it in The chicken didn't taste super-fresh either so it might have been cooked and rewarmedAs for the service it mainly consisted of about 10 people milling around the small dining room refilling water asking how the meal was and being confused about what went where I'm still looking for a great Indian place in the valley but I've had much better food at Royal Taj in Tempe and Star of India in Ahwatukee.
1422,"""In a wordSerene""What can I say about the Hyatt Regency Scottsdale Resort and Spa @ Gainey RanchIt was our first trip to the Phoenix/Scottsdale area and if you enjoy the simple luxuries of a short-refreshing weekend to get away from it all this is the place to stay The property is secluded but yet a short drive to the main area of downtown Scottsdale The service is wonderful there were check-in kiosks and plenty of receptionists (it was a mid-afternoon check-in) The rooms were clean modern and typical of business style hotel as most hyatts sheratons and other hotels of the sort What stood out to us was the setting The hotel as you drive up has a large fountain in the middle of square (yes not circular) driveway and the hotel is just plain open You can see the large sitting area (where at night people gather to drink mingle and even roast marshmallows) Beyond that is what is a large pool area (1 adult only pool and a general-large all ages pool area) More about that in a minuteIf you veer to the right of the pool area and behind it is this small yet peaceful garden and beyond that was a full golf course Now the piece du resistance (for me anyways is the expansive pool area) The pool has the typical hot-tub poolside bar but beyond that it has small basketball hoop two volleyball nets a sandy beach section a couple of waterfalls and a 3 story water slide (excellent) Now could it have been the weather was beautiful (80 degrees in late October) combined with one of my favorite pluses to a hotel a large pool area honestly a pool area to either bathe in the sun sip a lovely beverage or dip in the pool to me that's a holiday (even if it was a short weekend getaway) holiday none the less Right the pool being expansive yet it didn't feel too large or overwhelming with tons of other hotel guests doing the same because then I would've gone to the adult only you would expect the pool area to be popular rightFor checkout there are two major pluses 1 it has a computer with printer so you can print your boarding passes for your flight home and it has spots for rental care return As for the spa my girlfriend's sister made use of it's services and for me I stepped into the reception area for nor more than five minutes with the combination of near whispering of the staff the soft gentle music and the rock laden water fountain I wanted to sit in of the comfy chairs and fall asleepBut you don't have to take my word for it In essence if you stay in the Phoenix /Scottsdale area whether for a short weekend or long holiday this has to be one of the choices to stay."
642,Great food and drinks This place has a great atmosphere for any occasion The guacamole is off the heezy.
2715,My typical dish of choice is Orange Chicken with Fried Rice  It's AMAZING  I wish I could afford to eat every meal thereI no longer live in Laveen but I will be travelling back to Laveen (and who wants to do that) just to have lunch/dinner at my favorite chinese place in PhoenixYUMMY.
4651,Yes I have been here beforeNow for a person who has been to Italy and has worked in restaurants for years I think I can give a pretty fair review:My Girlfriend and I went there very hungry on a Friday night they were not busy nor slow about average for October in Phoenix We called to make a reservation and when we came in we were seated without menus Now working in restaurants this is almost un-heard of but like I said we were hungryThe waiter came over and asked if we would like something to drink (A little rudely) but like I keep saying we were hungry Since we didn't have any menus including a wine menu we asked the waiter to see some menus He proceeded to only bring a wine menuAfter we made are choice we laid the menu down in clear vision of the waiter (A definite sign to come back to the table) He then proceeded to take the other tables' orders (Perfectly fine) Oh and they had both food and drink menus as this comes back later in the storyWe waited for a solid 10 min before trying to flag down the waiterNOTHING We decided to try to flag him down and he was having none of it We then got up from the table and left Walking right passed the so called manager (Older lady with short brown hair) she told us to have a good night as if we just had a great dinnerWe were so hungry we needed to go somewhere else On the way to a much nicer and hospitable establishment I called Cristo's and asked to speak to the manager The lady who told us to have a good night answered and told us she was the head manager and then proceeded to tell us that not giving people who sit down at a restaurant menus unless they ask I had never been so offended in my life A straight up LIE I could not hear any more Hopefully the owner reads this and make this right I am not seeking anything free I just don't want this to happen to anyone else  EVER AGAIN.
3703,"Was in town for the gay rodeo with a friend from NY hoping his first rodeo experience would be hella fun Being country dancers we were hoping to tear up the dance floor every night we were in town All we got was more and more frustrated at the entire experience The country dj completely out of sight or reach had no clue the concept of playing to the crowd or even knowledge of country club music Meaningknowing the difference between a 2-step shuffle shadow west coast swing or east coast swingwhich btw not only did he only played 1 east coast swing all night Saturday  but ZERO waltz's The song selection although current top 40 hits (surprisingly because the line dances all but 2 were from the past 20 years done to the even more tired original songs from 20 years ago) was more like a bad juke box no format whatsoever and the transitions were horriblecutting off songs before they ended as the next song was abruptly forced in Upon making requests we were told ""ok I think I have it"" yet we never heard them Now I can understand club Djs not taking requests but in all the country clubs I've been to and this includes rodeos and other gay country dance events for the past 15 years requests are very crucial to keeping and making your guests feel welcome and included Especially if they are songs or dances that will show the locals something new they might like to try Now that's just the music The dance floor etiquette was non existant They have let the drunk queens take over the dance floor way before the music even switched over not caring one bit about the couples or dancers trying to menuver around them Only once were they told not to bring drinks to the dance floor but never to get their drunk asses out of the way before they get intentionally plowed into by people that are fed up with it The patio was useless for non smokers The dance floor is way too small for a club that brings in as many people as this one does What a wasted use of space where the volleyball court is That Should be the dance floor The only saving grace was catching up with old rodeo friends and the taco truck So this club along with the no dance floor and ridiculous all day entertainment at the rodeo grounds has reassured my friend and myself will NOT be returning next year."
62,I had heard about this place for years but never went Tragic I know Just recently I discovered that it was literally walking distance from Jester'Z Improv where I work Oh how i must now make up for lost timePop the Soda Shop is a true place of brilliants They have a fantastic selection and a very knowledgeable staff When you come to pops that is what you are looking for product And they have the best selection in town A couple of recommendations Doctor Eli's Blueberry Jackson Hole Huckelberry or really any thing in the Birch Beer section.
2483,I LOVE this place it is so addicting It is always pretty busy and the space is small but it is sooo worth it The  Tortas are THE perfect sandwich their meat is so flavorful and the bun that they use is soft and toasted with mayo lettuce tomato their homemade salsa and onion My husband and I usually share the chicken Torta a bowl of their AMAZING pozole and a couple of Carnitas tacos Flavorful affordable delicious Enough said.
927,"08/30/12Was here for Stephen Chbosky's Q&A and book-signing event for _the perks of being a wallflower_  I've only been to three book-signing events and the two most-fun ones were held here  My first ever was Elizabeth Gilbert's _Eat Pray Love_ event which was VERY engaging and entertaining so I had a feeling that Chbosky's event would be just as pleasing  The space was packed with an eclectic mix of teenagers young adults and professor-types  I suspect a large percentage of the audience were writers themselves individuals who aspire to become writers or are curious to learn more about the creative processes of writing acting and directing  The author was funny very approachable empowering and confident  and yet very humble  The long excerpt he read was from an audience member's well-used book with a jacket that did not resemble any of the two current ones (a lemon-yellow one and a movie cover)  After the reading Chbosky opened the floor to questions each of which he answered in depth and with a lot of humor  At one point a young mother had to rock and coo her baby to stop fussing but the author immediately put her at ease with an ""oh no don't worry"" and that he had a three-week old daughter at home and so knew what the mother was going through so ""just let the baby cry and do her thing""  I thought it fantastic how he encouraged aspiring writers to not listen to those who limited their creative processes but to find their own ways their own voices with which to express their thoughts  Questions were asked on what inspired him to write certain poems in the book (the protagonist Charlie writes poems and diary entries that address the audience members as if they were reading the entries themselves as opposed to being narrated to) how it was to direct certain scenes and what it was like to work with the cast which included Emma Watson (Hermione in the Harry Potter movies) Logan Lerman (D'Artagnan in 2011's The Three Musketeers) and Ezra Miller (Kevin in We Need to Talk About Kevin)  He even had a lovely mention regarding actor Paul Rudd's participation in the movie I am looking forward to seeing the film which is coming out next month  :)I was first attracted to this book which I've yet to read when I caught the movie's trailer a few weeks ago and was frozen in my tracks upon hearing the honest eye-opening quote one of the author's favorite lines he's written to date:""We accept the love we think we deserve""  I cannot wait to delve into the book to find other gems  I already know I'll find the movie lovely  I thank Changing Hands for hosting yet another terrific book event- I had a wonderful time."
4849,So we ordered 6 pizzas tonight for my son's b-day party They got 2 pizzas wrong We went back to complain and got attitude from them and no apologiesAre we ever going back Nope.
51,"My first visit to Eddie's house was really an exceptional dining experience We were seated a one of the oversized wooden four tops overlooking the patio from one side and peering into the kitchen from the opposite I was facing the kitchen and enjoyed watching the action and seeing all the enticing entrees and apps coming out It was also cool to see Chef Eddie doing his thing back there and working just as hard as any of his employees The decor of the place reminded me of a southern country club: dark rich colors nice but not pretentious and comfortableWe started with two orders of the Mo'rockin shrimp one per couple because they were so highly touted After my first bite I was so thankful we had done so Firstthey tasted incredible So many flavors in one bite- I could lick the plate and die happy Second there are only four shrimp per order and no one deserves only one bite of those delicious little morsels I questioned the biscuit balls at first glance but after splitting one in half and sopping up the remaining sauce on the plate I understood how tasty and functional they were My side of the table split a Caesar  salad that had great dressing but was a tad hard to eat for me because it was not chopped I made lots of noise chopping it myself but still managed to make it work My other half was not pleased with the chopped olives sprinkled on top but I liked the extra favor acidity they added For dinner I had the whole portion of sea bass and it was literally perfect I can't say I have ever had better It was served with some gorgeous and just as tasty broccolini Sharing is a common occurrence among the four diners who were present so I got to taste a little bit of everyone's My guy had ""what's in my steak""  which looked like a giant edible softball on a plate but tasted like a big sweet hug from grandma Comfort food extraordinaire  It reminded me of something Willy Wonka would make Crazy looking but scrum-diddily-umptious The tuna and halibut from ""east meets west "" were both excellent and the golden beet slices that accompanied the scallops were delish Finally for dessert the birthday boy in our group chose the ""chocolate pot du creme"" Holy mother of all that is chocolate This was amazing It looked and tasted like liquid fudge It was incredibly rich and decadent and perfect to share All of this deliciousness accompanied by two bottles of La Crema Chardonnay  plus my lovely dining companions equalled a five star review and a lasting memory of a wonderful night."
2248,A) The place was so dimly lit I couldn't even see to the other side of the restaurant B) They skimped on the Italian vinaigrette on the salad but I feel like they were doing me a favor because what I did have on my salad wasn't very tasty The bread was okay but nothing to write home about The oil used for dipping the bread into tasted like the stuff you get in gallon jugs at Costco/Sam's ClubC) This was my first time to dine at Carrabba's so I went with the classic spaghetti and meatballs (if you can't do that right I don't trust you to do anything else right either) The meatballs weren't bad but it was a $3 upcharge to add three of them and they were pretty tiny meatballs The standard sauce that comes with the spaghetti isn't even as good as the canned/jarred stuff you can buy in the grocery store My father and I both agreed that it tasted nearly-identical to the Michelina's frozen spaghetti dinners you spend less than $1 for at the grocery store Summary: I won't be going back on my own accord.
3228,Just terrible I ordered fajitas expecting chicken cooked over a grill nope I got pan fried flavorless garbage The waitress was a ditz that couldn't be bothered and she forgot to comp the free chips and salsa Oh and it was ridiculously loud we had to sit next to these old ladies playing majong and it sounded like a combine was driving over my head every time they scrambled the pieces I officially hate this chilis the only good thing about the meal was the chicken enchilada soup which must come out of a bag otherwise I can't see how it doesn't suck like everything else Bad food bad service way to loud why is there no negative star rating This place gets negative two stars If the sign on the door didn't say chilis I would have thought I was sitting in a dumpster behind the circle k that serves food next to a jet engine testing facility Thanks Chilis for making burger king look like fine dining.
3677,I agree with Danielle I have been going there for years without a problem and I recently went there expecting the same service The place has changed I dropped a uniform off that I needed to pick up the same day so I made sure I was there before 9am when I went back to pick up and they told me since it is being laundered it won't be ready until tomorrow I showed my tickets that said current date by 4pm she then told me it's wrong how they don't do it like that anymore and how it would be too much work for them to find it for us but offered up half of the uniform I guess they don't understand the reason for a uniform How do you argue with someone with that kind of mentality.
3809,The best thing I can say was that the food was good  Then it went down hill from there  The hostess scowled at us when we asked for a booth  The waitress never smiled  When the food arrived (there were three of us there) all we could do was gasp and laugh at the puny portions  Then when the bill arrived - we were still hungry and it was $60 for lunch  On the upside the manager was called over and they brought out some extra food to 'make up' for the small portions at no charge  That would have put our lunch total to $90 for the three of us   Eek Me thinks not  I will never go back there  Oh yea we arrived at 11 am on Monday and got the last parking place  For me the Yard is totally ridiculous.
3264,"I am just going to hit on the new ""Mill Avenue's New Year's Eve"" since most of the year Mill Ave is exactly what you would expect so you should know if this is the kind of atmosphere you want to visit or not Because the Fiesta Bowl didn't find hosting the NYE block party as profitable Tempe was left to execute the event alone starting 12/31/12 Previously Mill was barricaded off you had to pay to enter and the block party included a variety of stages and outdoor vendors you could visit while mulling around the crowds or visiting the Mill Ave shops/bars At the north end of the party was a stage that generally included a well known music performance Now that Tempe has taken over the only significant difference between NYE and any other night on Mill is the crowded sidewalks Now while I have a hard time faulting a non-profit for backing away from a losing venture in the case of the Fiesta Bowl an organization that has proven to be a private circle jerk for Arizona's most-connected individuals where their organization benefits heavily from public support well beyond their NP status they seem to only find losing ventures as those which do not provide the most value to the Fiesta Bowl members personally The city of Tempe's 2012/2013 event was enough to make sure I don't return next year Honestly I don't even give one star reviews but there is nothing to savor about the event as a whole It's free and you get exactly what you pay for -- crowds of people crammed onto the sidewalks so pedestrians can't move and traffic can't make it through the crowds that saturate the crosswalks There is no organization so each bar is doing it's own thing (except more crowded/expensive than usual) and all the while the only ""entertainment"" is the same burnouts who always sit on Mill with their drum music trying to engage pedestrians for money  But should you still decide to go next year -- because the city's PR department will tell us that they've made it better than ever -- don't say I didn't warn you."
3898,With 4 stars on yep I was hoping for a tasty breakfast but after a long wait I got a plate of overcooked eggs weird tasting greasy bacon completely undercooked potatoes (how hard is it to cook taters until they are brown) and the toast they served tasted just like the greasy grill terrible It was all really inedible as was the Menudo that my girlfriend ordered Disgusting Also people are in there at 10am drinking large beers very weird place Is it a restaurant store bar Not sure I am sure it sucks though and I will never go back.
1705,After growing up in SoCal and having Tommy's chili burger whenever we wanted it was a shock when we moved to AZ 9 years ago to not be able to have a Tommy burger anytime we wanted {or needed like after a night of drinking} Well I think all that has changed now that we 'discovered' Chili Billy's I think it's as good as Tommy's but my wife thinks it's even better than Tommy's He definitely has an excellent recipe and the chili works so well for a chili cheese burger I can't wait to go back  I almost forgot the fries they are the some of the best I've ever had anywhereThe owner was very friendly and talked with us about how he started and other items he had on the menu the pastrami sounds really good {Sorry but I forgot his name}.
4468,"The ONLY thing I like about this dinasour is entering through the kitchenUnfriendly bartenderS two of them food is ok but let's not go crazy here it's not great  Just another ""institiution"" that gets a free pass becauseI don't know why they get a free passThe red-flocked wall paper is older than dirt so are the waitresses  Just so mediocre  So many other places to go."
3194,Came in and was seated before a party of six we were 3 adults and 2 babies The party of 6 was seated next to us The hostess took our drink order and I told her I was ready to order she said the bartender would be there soon to take our order( where's the real waitress) after waiting 10 minutes we finally got our tea and next to us got there drinks I once again reminded the hostess and bartender we were ready to order now another 10 mins went by and the bartender went to the table next to us and took their order and completely ignored us Horrible we all got up and left.
4929,Yes Abu J I will elaborate Just for you$6 burger Fail  you probably cost 35¬¢ to make and you were coldSoggy french fries Fail  How do you F up fries SrslySprite lacking Co2 Fail  It is NOT hard to reattach a new tankCustomer Service Fail   I don't appreciate being scowled at while handing over moneyAnd honestly I never liked this place its crap IMO.
1368,Amazing ServiceAmazing food Must try everything at least once We almost did tonight Lol so flavorful and portioned just right.
3283,Over-rated over-priced and where's the filling Tastes like flavor-less boxed-cake with sugary frosting Can't believe the owner judges Cupcake Wars and doesn't change her recipe  I want some filling in the middle with a ganache icing for that price Lines out the doorI don't get it.
2304,"Bosa you've been dethroned I don't know what miraculous alternate dimension Golden Donuts warped out of and frankly I don't care What I do care about is a quality donut and on that Golden totally delivers Perfect old fashioneds French crullers without that all-too-common weird grittiness Amazingly light perfectly glazed raised donuts Cinnamon swirls that actually taste like--get this--cinnamonThe stamp on the box boastingly proclaims them to be ""The Best Donuts in Arizona"" and I can't disagree The only donut I can even begin to criticize is the long john and it's not even bad it's just that I prefer mine a little taller than Golden's flatter (but still quite delicious) version."
4017,Very little value  We had been customers for the past 15 years  Under it's current management it's a complete ripoff.
891,Greg() had my car running smoothly in a snap Thank you so much.
4550,"We got seated quickly but waited 15min to place our drink order In the meantime a group got seated next to us they were greeted them follewed by another server telling th about their ""team service"" Too bad we didn't get any of that team service' We ordered the crab crusted tilipia they forgot the broccoli (and when they bring it it tasted like rubber) the dish was disappointing They were nice enough to take it off the bill Overall the service was poor and food was sub par I hadn't been to Red Lobster is some years and not I remeber why Next time I'm in that area i'lll choose to go elsewhere."
2642,Well another AMAZING time at SwitchThank You for the perfect service from Tim Lotthe is the BEST in the businessWe took a new friend there last Saturday and she had a blast  Relatively new to Arizona from LA she was impressed with the urban vibe eclectic menu and great service from Tim 2 for 1 happy hour great apps non stop attention who would not be happy   Well I could not say anything that has not been already saidjust GO Ask for TIM and enjoy.
1871,A Big Breakfast with a small menuNote: this review is for the vegetarian optionsSmall cute restaurant in the middle of a neighorhood area that ALWAYS seems to have a line Words of advice- WAIT IN THE LINE Service- we sat at the bar which isn't huge (I think there were between 12-15 stools) and the  server was very friendly very helpful and very nice Our food was brought out promptly water was refilled before we could get close to finishing and we were checked up on every 5 minutes 5 starsAtmosphere- Really cute place that's always full It's not huge but it's not tiny either Everyone seems to be in a good mood and its a wonderful BRUNCH location It's fairly loud so not a quiet date location but great to come with 1 person for good food or with a small group for brunch at the tables 4 starsFood- And now for the best part The food They have a small menu which I don't mind because everything is well thought out and creative The cheese omelet (with Wisconsin cheddar of course) was well-cooked didn't have too much cheese to make it goopy and went very well with the sauteed onions The made-from-scratch Belgian waffle was DIVINE Every bite was delicious and the REAL maple syrup it's served with is delicious Don't drench the waffle so you can taste the amazing batter itself and the syrup to compliment it 5 starsDrinks- ORDER THE FRESH HONEY LEMONADE Wonderfully refreshing on a hot day fresh homemade taste and sweetened with honey to add that kick at the end 4 STARSBottom line- come early wait in line with good company try 1 thing with syrup 1 without and order the lemonade Go home happy.
616,I used to train in this dojo as a teenager a couple of years ago Ray Hughes Sensei has got to be one of the best role models in the Martial Arts community Both Hughes Sensei and Tyler Sensei are incredible with kids they keep their attention make the classes fun but most importantly they properly teach their students how and when to defend themselves The programs are not only for children but for all ages including adults In fact there are several intense seminars dedicated to adult training focusing on developing both the mind and body to properly defend itself Basic class setup: Starts of with stretching cardio basically a quick warmup Next a quick meditation (the dojo is a stress free environment meditation is to help calm your mind) Then you go through basic form drills (to ensure you have correct footing hand placement and momentum) Towards the end there might be sparing drills (safety first all students are required to wear padding for arms legs and a mouth guard) Class is finished off with another meditation to unwind the body The main focus of the dojo is teaching Wado but there are other floors dedicated for Jujitsu and other Martial Arts Programs Great clean facility Near the Ice Den so plenty of parking Located in a safe area Quality wooden floors in the smaller rooms and padding on the main floor to ensure maximum safety Clean cold water fountain Air conditioned fans to circulate air Well lit Spacious locker rooms clean bathrooms Well stocked inventory with padding and gis (uniforms) for all sizes No contracts just a monthly payment if you dedicate yourself to the classes and really want to learn then it is well worth the money.
2597,This is one of my favorite burger placesand it doesn't hurt that they make some fantastic martinis to go with :)The sweet potato fries are the best in the city - if I say so myself (and I think I've tried them all)  Sometimes you have to wait here but it is always worth the extra time.
1989,"What is up with crappy customer service in this town  I am giving this place 1 star based on the fact that my dinner companion and I couldn't eat more than 1 bite of the Mahi curry dish because it was so hot  Don't get me wrong I love spice we have a multitude of hot sauces chili paste and spicy oils in our home collection  My companion loves loves loves things spicy but when we both take a bite and can't actually taste any flavors of the dish just burning lava well it is simply to hot  When we called our server over to let him know that the dish was way to hot to be palatable he asked if we wanted it boxed up  Um no please just take it away  He didn't even ask if we wanted something differentHere is the kicker when he brought our check the dish was still on it  I called him over and asked for him to remove it for the obvious reason that we sent it back  His response ""Ohhh sorry  It does say spicy on the menu""  I couldn't believe it  I got charged $1495 for a dish we couldn't even eat  Totally lame  A manager didn't even come over to try to smooth this issue out  I left nothing for the tip considering they were ok to rip me off  I won't be back."
2002,I agree we should have tried it a lot sooner  Great food  Every thing is very fresh  The chicken gorganzolla is made with a real cream sauce you can taste that clearly  The fried calmari were tender and delicate  Very friendly and competant service.
3476,scary unless you are homeless stay away disgusting unsanitary hole in the wallmanager is a crazy lady who yells at you and watches you to make sure you dont take any food hometables sticky bathroom is similar to ones you find at a truck stop pealing paint and unkept  carpet has holes in it and appears noone has cleaned it in a while.
4449,"""Why am I here"" was the only thing I could think of while standing on the handicap ramp in a very crowded very poorly chosen location I've thought about the positives: Expansive craft beer selection relatively quick service considering the space constraints and crowd size live music and lots of guest brewers coming in (shout-out to Four Peaks) But after considering all of these positives I was still standing on a ramp with a $7 Brewdog IPA (which is amazing) in hand questioning why in the world they would put this great of a concept in this terrible of a location I can't help but to think that World of Beer Inc saw an opportunity to capitalize on the craft beer culture that has been pioneered by the likes of The Roosevelt Tavern Four Peaks Papago Brewing and Taste of Tops (among others) and forced their corporate concept on to Mill Ave in to whatever space they could find It should be noted that this Florida-based company is being run by the former management of Outback Steakhouse At least I hope the franchisee is a local and has better bona fides than the corporate Outback crew If you really are in to craft beer support your local proprietors."
4730,Lets start off good and work downward shall weI loved the salad bar THE BEST APPLE AND CHICKEN SALAD I ever had  Mozzarella Boccochinis the best asparagus  I have had ever Not crazy about the Prosciutto (no taste very blah) but the smoked salmon superbly sliced and Fabulous Let me not forget what ever was on the table in the pop over bread thing OMG that was a highlight for me Now I like to see my wait staff work hard as I tip off that idea These Guys were on their game quickly as if they were riding a horse they came to the table with swords of meat and sliced accordingly to my desired cook level After sampling every meat  (or most of them) I dawned on me that somehow they all tasted alike   The saturation on herbs and the distinct flavor of lemon smothered each meat   Now I like lemon of lamb and pork but not everything  I did PIG out and I was sorry that I could not afford the 1450 for a glass of wine nor the 850 for a cup of coffee  I love meat and meat loves me but I just can't be that glutenous  Sorry I could not be more support of.
1220,I tried Torched Goodness yesterday at Techiepalooza at Skysong in Scottsdale I bought the vanilla and the sea salt caramelThe good: Eric was polite the portion size was reasonable and the price was affordableThe really good: The creme brulee was delicious The top was caramelized and crunchy the custard had a lovely texture and an equally lovely flavorI hope to track down the truck around Thanksgiving and try the pumpkin flavor If it's anything as good as the vanilla I'm in for a treat.
2402,This place has the best bratwurst I've ever eaten My husband and I tried the currywurst and the venison brat and they were both excellent The flavors are simply amazing Also I think they make their own saukraut we loved it And you must try the german potatoes The poutine was just ok but I'm picky being that I'm from Montreal Would come back here next time I'm in Scottsdale.
856,"I have been to this place about 15 times and each time I have gotten the roasted turkey and stuffing (their specialty) and it is so good I have not tried any other sandwich that they make I'm sure their other sandwiches are good but when I go in there to eat and I see people ordering and eating other sandwiches and it actually kind of infuriates me to the point where I have to take deep breaths and refrain myself from getting in right in their face and screaming ""What the %$"
1308,I'm always happy to support local businesses and was happy to see something new opening instead of closing on Mill Ave However Poppa Maize's popcorn is well how do I put this horrible We tried the chocolate peanut butter and cake batter last night and threw out full bags after a couple of bites Even my kids wouldn't eat it and they are usually like human vacuum cleaners The texture was like styrofoam and both flavors were oddly bitter I don't know if the popcorn was old or if it's always this bad but I don't want to try it againHoping they can somehow fix their mistakes sounds like they have some fans and are capable of much more than what I tasted.
1961,"Five stars no doubt for Brian the store manager I know you can't seek him out for everything because I'm sure he's busy Last night my husband had to have a water heater replacedGE agreed to replace it but had us take it to home depot and then have home depot call GE I thought it would be a nightmare and they would look at him like he was a nutBrian got right on it Had someone from the Customer Service desk call while he searched for the water heater (which was hiding btw he found it though) My husband doesn't go in to details about his experience at storeshe's just not that interested but he raved about BrianBrian helped us once before in the lawn and garden dept He was honest about the product and offered something more effective He must have taken some crazy advanced Customer Service class or he isnotfromthisplanet Seriously he rocksThere's a woman that works in plumbing tooI don't know her name I think she said her family owned a plumbing business at one time She knows her shit If it not for these two I wouldn't even rate that store because my mother always said ""if you can't say anything nice don't say anything at all""."
4836,If you like your hairdon't go.
1442,Gross  Their tortilla soup tasted like vomit  After two spoons full I proceeded to throw up in the bathroom  NEVER EATING THERE AGAIN.
1948,This is a very nice store I have to say a bit more helpful than the one in ScottsdaleThis location knows what Nordstrom is known for Great Customer ServiceThis is a few days after Christmas now and there is still major mall activityMore I think than before ChristmasBut Nordstrom is still nice still easy to be there and to deal withI had to return a pair of shoes I had gotten for Christmas WhyBecause I just did not like them Nordstrom is great with returns as well They took them back  credited the account and I was on my wayPlus they are the nicest decorated store in the mall.
1211,I use to work here about 5 years ago and now I am embarrassed to have said that  We went to eat there during the week and there wasn't hardly anybody there  We ordered a couple of appetizers and they were horrible  I ate the Pasta Milano and it is usually great especially when I worked there  Now this crap is garbage  My wife had some rigatoni stuff and it was terrible  I asked the server what the hell is going on  He said that the people that own Planet Hollywood had bought the Macaroni Grill brand from Brinker International  They don't even wear ties anymore and they wear jeans They don't have a store manager there anymore This one is garbage and their food sucks If you don't believe me then go there yourself  Food use to be so much better years ago.

44,Chipotle Fast Healthy or not (depending on what you're in the mood for) I love the consistency of service and quality across locations I grew up in Colorado and have enjoyed many meals at the original location by the University of Denver No matter what location visit you will receive delicious food made with quality ingredients I was always a chicken burrito with extra rice black beans corn salsa lettuce and cheese kind of gal Most recently I've fallen in love with the salad Romaine lettuce with all the burrito toppings you prefer My latest creation is chicken fajita veggies pico de gallo corn salsa with a tiny bit of cheese hot red chili salsa and dressing on the side I take this creation home put it in a big bowl toss everything together and devour The marinade from the chicken and the juices from the salsa and veggies create an awesome dressing I dip my fork in the side of salsa and vinegarette before each bite providing just the right amount of tang and spice The combinations are endless I dream of Chipotle.
3871,"I went back to Darque Tan yesterday to freeze my membership since I'm going to Europe for a few weeks  The gal behind the counter informed me that the last day to freeze an account is the 10th of every month even though the credit card on file is not charged until the 16th of every month  I told her I'd most likely cancel then and proceeded to tan  When I was finished I came back to the counter  She asked ""So what did you decide""  I told her that I'd decided to cancel and she promptly printed out my cancellation form  It was dated 07/16/08  I asked her if my card would still be charged since the cancel date was the 16th instead of yesterday's date  She nodded and informed me ONLY THEN that the last day to cancel without a charge would have been the 10th  It would have been nice if she had told me that  So then I figured well shoot I am paying anyway maybe I should just keep the membership so I'll have a tan package when I get back  I asked her if it was too late to cancel  Her answer ""Well sort of  It would be really hard and I'd have to call my manager to do it""  So I left and I don't think I'll ever walk through those doors again  What a shame  If that clerk wasn't too lazy to reverse the cancellation Darque Tan would still have a good paying customer."
1309,Contacted Real Fast about tiniting the windows in my new car  Joe and his guys price was much less then the dealership and I was very happy with the resultsWe noticed some to the tint peeling up and Joe's guy came right out and resolved the issueVery good service.
2468,I've used Dutch Girls off and on for years They were always great to deal with but I think they must have sold because the new counter person is not someone you'd choose to interface with the public I can't say for sure but I strongly suspect that they failed to send out a leather jacket I left for dry cleaning meaning they may have charged me for something they didn't do That would never have happened with the prior owner In the meantime the quality at the laundry at Thunderbird and 40th Street has come up substantially and they're much cheaper so I don't see a reason to go back to Dutch Girls.
1972,All I know is that they make the best al pastor burritos and tacos in Phoenix They are just sweet enough just savory enough and I always want 50 more of them When it's sunny and not smoldering hot outside the picnic tables out front are a great place to have lunch Parking can get to be tricky when it's busy but you can go next door and thrift shop it up while you wait for your food to be ready.
697,I have been stopping in at Phx Ale since it opened it doors  I stop in about once or twice a month  The place is small little tasting room connected to the brewery/warehouse  They have continued to make the tasting room better - added an actual bar top put in a few TVS but it is a very low key place  Management really supports the local community so they have local artwork displayed around the tasting room  It fills the plain walls but I could see this as being a little overwhelming or tacky  You come here to try their beer there is no food but there are food trucks that will park in the parking lot on certain days  The beers seem to be getting better as the brewery expands their line-up  I believe they are up to seven beers they originally had three  The Ironwood Imperial Porter is legit  Even if you are not one to drink darker beers its worth a try  This is my favorite as the beers are more English style and I prefer hoppy beers and the Phx Ale Camelback IPA doesn't really do it for me  It is good just not what I look for in an IPA  Another plus is that you will order your beers from the owners (usually)  They are very friendly knowledgeable and laid back I highly recommend Phoenix Ale Brewery don't have high expectations in regards to aesthetics but it is all about experiencing the beer.
2668,good food their tortas and chimichangas are delicious :Danyone know what oil they use on their meats/breads thanks.
15,I can honestly say this is the most I've laughed at a dinner theatre The cast is witty and very funny I have seen two of their shows now and always wish I had invited more friends I'm so glad they have started shows on the west side too My only discretion if you're looking for a normal conservative show this may not be your best choice It's more out of the box and the interactive but that's what I love about it.
1717,this place is great small fantastic service a dang good bar food met a couple of friends there for lunch today excellent fish and chips the girls had salads nice leafy mix greens good size portions and like I say GREAT service.

2285,Loved everything about this placeread my tips.
4485,We were staying in Chandler AZ and saw this restaurant across the street from our hotel   So we tried it out for dinner and what a mistakeFirst off  we ordered a pitcher of margaritas which was shared between the two of us    After drinking the $20 pitcher we came to the conclusion that there must have been about one shot of tequila in the whole thing I ordered the Steak fajita taco salad  That was my second mistake- well I guess third mistake if you count walking in the door to the place  This Steak fajita taco salad was a disgusting fried shell with a small amount of steak and onions in the bottom covered by about five inches of old dry lettuce     When it arrived at the table the bottom portion was just a nasty juicy mess that could barely be eaten The juice was not any sort of sauce It must have been the oil that the steak and onions were cooked in    The part of the shell that was not submerged in this grease even tasted like very old frying oil and nothing else  My girlfriend had the spinach enchilada dinner  There was no taste of spinach in this enchilada  All of the taste was some spice that they had went overboard with  We like spicy things but this was not a good thing  It seems that the Mexican restaurants around here do not re-fry their beans which is fine   These beans in particular tasted like absolutely nothing-  which may have been for the better  The only thing edible on the plate was the riceIt's a good thing I live in Illinois so I don't have to look at this pace again    I really feel ripped off     You can't even count on your $20 worth of margaritas to have enough alcohol to make the food seem good.
195,"I'm not a big ""organic"" kind of guy  I could care less about hormone free this and BPA free that  For me it all about flavor and service - it has to be better than I can make it myself and you have to take better care of us than I canHaving said that I'm HEAD OVER HEELS in love with the food at Tryst  Service is family oriented too  They treat you like a regular on your first trip in the door and burgers are to die forAs a die-hard burger man this is my default stop  It is close to the house in a pleasant shopping center and has the best burger I've ever eaten in Phoenix  I'd give it an extra half star if Yelp would let me  This place is that good."
2890,I tried Yogurtlogy as part of a gluten free foodies tour (
4653,"Horrible service I walked in and waited The restaurant wasn't that busy and I could see there were tables available  The lady in front of me had 8 in her party the manager seemed very stressed when she told him the size of her party  He had told the lady I don't think I have a place for you because I don't have a full staff  This was on a Saturday morning and right before the holidays  He saw me standing and waiting by the door while others were coming in to dine  He said somewhat rudely ""You can sit down and wait  I'll be right with you""  I never once was  rude to him and I was waiting patiently while he assisted the lady with a party of 8   I was shocked by his tone and so I walked out Never eating at that Coco's  I found a local cafe down the street and so glad I did."
1103,"I write this because I actually care about this place Gameworks opened in 1997 I was actually part of the opening crew I only worked there about 6 months but I loved it so much I would make it my weekly haunt for several years  At that time Gameworks kept up with the gaming market which of course has gone down severely since console and computer gaming has become more popular However Gameworks was never a game room or an arcade For the first year that it was opened you could have money deducted from your paycheck if you referred to Gameworks as either one of those in the presence of a manager Gameworks was an experience It's originating concept was what would happen if a bunch of 90's tweens were to find an old abandoned building that was powered by ""Surge"" soda The magical new super caffeinated mountain dew alternative for tweens living the extreme  The credit system they used was supposed to be easy on parents and tweens alike Mom or Dad could buy a card that could be used in every part of Gameworks excluding the bar That way a kid didn't have to carry around actual money and could play games get a burger and fries drink some SURGE ectect  Video games had cup holders and fries were served in cups so kids could snack as they played Upstairs there was a coffee bar a regular bar and a full restaurant They had leather couches and chairs in parts of the bar and coffee bar They had an area for retro 80's games Most importantly they had two special attractions known as Vertical Reality and the INDY 500 In the middle of the upstairs they had a professional sound and video board with some of the latest equipment available at the time They had actual DJ's that were called Play Jockeys controlling video and audio feeds to the 5 different quadrants of the building During the initial year of opening I witnessed lines outside the door of people trying to get in the door  They had over a thousand people riding the indy 500 hundred  each week during the summer They had contest with great prizes like Superbowl tickets Harley Davidson and one Halloween they gave away a stand up House of the Dead arcade game Now the decline-Every company has a vision and talking points that they pass off as their do's and don'ts Gameworks always wanted  to have staff available to assist people The first notice of decline of course was under staffing No longer were people greeting others giving them a random free play on the games Instead of running multiple lines of Vertical reality which had multiple bays they would only keep open one or two  Instead of having announcers always stationed at indy 500 a sign was put in place that said see attendant for assistance  Secondly the one golden rule they swore they would never ever ever EVER BREAK Gameworks will never have redemption games Tickets were considered evil instead they had a gift shop where you could buy things like shirts shot glasses and all kinds of other crap you could possibly find as prizes at other places  They day I walked in and saw the first game spitting tickets and the words redemption I felt I was kicked in the nuts The final straw would be the multiple changes to the bar Certain liquors beers ect were gone Certain specialty drinks gone Great bartenders gone Happy hour host and play jockey's gone The music is now a loop the play Jockey audio and visual station is not used Last time I was in there the bartenders were using jigs had no flair and most importantly were more concerned with trying to  get the one girl who was in the bar to talk to them instead of making money by serving drinks up selling and keeping conversation with multiple patrons Gone was the once warm inviting atmosphere and instead I felt like I was having a drink poured for me by a 21 year old holding a liquor bottle for the first time At this point the once great establishment that I have spent thousands of dollars at between 97 and 2007 has become a poor depressing shell of what it once was You could actually close the bar get rid of the restaurant and put a pizza place upstairs and they could probably pull off a chucky cheese gig and be more profitable then what they appear to me Opportunities for improvement-It is my firm belief that Gameworks has the chance to reinvent themselves if they would try a radical approach  At this time they have at least 3 or 4 great spaces that they could potentially use for LAN gaming and console gaming It would very easy to set up multiple consoles and a internal LAN and do a pay for the hour or day thing Much like Howie's game shack in mesa riverview They also need to go back to the night club ambiance after 8pm Bring back the play jockeys and the hostesses Bring back that feeling of warmthUpdate as of  7/21/13Attraction rides have been taken out Many of the non-redemption games looked in horrible shape Seemed like nothing but driving and redemption games "
3914,So I'm catching up on all my reviews an sorry to say this place being right across the street from me I probably won't go out of my way to go again The food is decent but the service is horrible more than one occasion myself and my party were ignored and I mean for almost an hour one time At one point I finally got up went to the bar and order than was looked at like what the hell are you doing up here go sit back down I almost threw a fit until my friend told me let it go Another occasion we sat at our table for over 30 mins and not one person came by yet servers kept passing us every 5 mins finally had to ask for a Manager but never showed than a server came along and finally took our Order I really hope they get/got  new management and let go most of the staff and get new blood who knows what they are doing.
2282,This spa is amazing The staff was very friendly and the services I received were outstanding  You can add on services to your treatments that are all great such as a hair dew treatment hot salt back scrub aroma therapy and many more There signature massage is a Blissage75 (a 75 min mass for $150) and their facial would be a Triple oxygen facial which is also 75 min long  All the technicians are trained well and are very professional   In the lounges you have fairytale brownies crackers cheeses cucumbers lemon/cucumber water  You will be very satisfied with your services at this spa.
4973,We show up to watch the Cardinals game for breakfast with the kids and this joke of a place had only two TVs in the dining area showing the Cardinals game The tables are all saved by people crowded around the two tvs this is an Arizona sports bar Really Meanwhile they have all this Cardinals signage up We always go here for games and their food is amazing but why did my fam and I have to drive to three places this morning until we found a decent place to watch the Cards game So pretty much don't go here if you want to catch a local team game on Sunday but Raiders and Steelers yep they've got thaton multiple tvs.
726,Awesome awesome awesome My mom and sister and I were on vacation in Phoenix and happened upon this place I am so glad we didThe drinks were amazing the lamb appetizer to die for and the trout was unlike anything I have ever tastedOur waiter was so attentive I only wish I didn't live a plane ride away.
1321,My boyfriend and I were excited to try the new Vig and stopped in on Saturday night  The atmosphere was awesome and they really did an amazing job remodeling the previous space  The outdoor patio area is fantastic and I would love to enjoy it more as the nice weather is approaching  However we will never be back due to the terribly poor service we received  We started with a couple of appetizers including Ceviche  Our server never checked back with us after dropping off the appetizers so we flagged down another staff member and requested some additional tortilla chips for our Ceviche  And then the waiting game started  In the meantime our server dropped off our meals and said the chips would be out shortly  Someone eventually brought us some chips and at that time we asked for additional tortillas for our fish tacos as they only come with three tiny tortillas about the size of a half dollar  Well the tortillas never came and our server never checked on us again  We eventually had to flag her down after our half eaten food got cold to ask for the check  I would understand slow service if it had been extremely busy that night but it wasn't  We were blatantly ignored by our server and got no apology  In fact it was almost as if we were a nuisance to her  And by the way the food is mediocre at best  There are way too many other great places to eat downtown to give this place another chance.
2650,By far the best Mexican food place around I have been going to Valle Luna since I was a kid and the food is always up to par You know what you are getting when you go Sometimes the service can be streaky but overall one of the better places to go Last time i tried their Cheese crisp extraordinaire It was freaking amazing I love when you pile steak bell peppers cream cheese onions and more into a cheese crisp.
179,Amazing food quality I am not eating grains or dairy for a little bit so you'd think I would have suffered here lol but on the contrary I found there was plenty of choices for me to choose from and what I ordered turned out to be DELICIOUS To start I had a side of Veggies which were Balsamic Braised Carrots & Broccolini They were cooked and seasoned perfectly The carrots were my favorite I would have eaten a few more orders of those had I been wearing elastic waist pants I made a mental note ) My main course was a TLC Salad It was composed of arugula spring greens beets pears smoked almonds & fennel with a citrus shallot vinaigrette I had them hold the pecorino & add chicken This was one of the most scrumptious salads I've ever had With every bite there was a different burst of yumminess The beets (of which I'm a big fan of now) and pear really made this salad The chicken was cooked perfectly and was not the least bit dry which I'm always afraid of I am glad that I added the extra protein because the salad size is not large so I would have been starvin marvin within an hour without it The service was excellent There's lots of parking in the back Both booths and tables are available and there was an outdoor seating area that faces Central There's also a drive through which is really uncommon for a non fast-food place lol & from what I hear you can order kegs to go ask more about that if you're interested because I didn't probe for details I was too busy imagining someone receiving a keg through a car window :D.
417,We love Sa Bai and have been coming here since they opened we are very lucky to have such a great place in our neighborhoodOur server always remembers us our drinks and what we usually order to eat  The food is fresh-fresh-fresh  Everything we have tried is excellent and they are very accomodating to special requestsWe heart Sa Bai and hope they thrive in our neighborhood for many years to come  We are so happy to support an excellent independent local restaurant.
659,Horrible Pharmacy Expect to be waiting at least 30min to wait for an auto re fill prescription Costumer service is non existent I am going to avoid this location from now on.
4692,"Over priced Stop for a quick bite before a flight out of town Never heard of the restaurant before and would never recommend this place now  I was charged for the""complimentary"" tortillas and guacamole - $395 for one person The sirloin entree I ordered was tough and dried out and was only about 5oz The majority of the $1795 entree was room temperature refried beans Save your money and go to Taco Bell."
2110,"Such a Disappointment I love Fox Restaurants so I was uber excited to finally check this place out We started with the Guacamole It looked amazing but was bland and flavorless I ordered the ahi tacos and they were ""meh"" Now my guy and I LOVE desserts but were so disappointed with what we had why bother hitting a disappointing trifecta Great decor great service boring flavorless food."
2031,Fantastic location for a nice dinner and a great place to host an event The food is awesome and the atmosphere of the restaurant is darling It's a great place to bring out-of-towners for a good meal with some Southwest flairWe had our wedding rehearsal dinner here and reserved the Cocktail Patio Admittedly it was hard at times working with John who is the group events coordinator However the extra time and patience does pay off because our rehearsal dinner was a very fun evening in a beautiful area reserved for just our party with great food The service was just okay we had much better service when dining normally at the restaurantmust be because of that automatic 22% event gratuity Some standout dishes:- Three Sister's Salsa & Trio of Hummus: They both come with the same AMAZING fry bread that is a must I personally thought the salsas were on the bland side and much preferred the trio of hummus which were more like thick brushettas as opposed to traditional hummus-  Entree Salads especially the Harvest Salad: These are the biggest salads I've ever seen The Harvest Salad is exceptionally - tons of macrona almonds fresh fruit delicious cheesea really refreshing and filling salad- Vegetarian Gemelli Pesto Pasta: Delicious vegetarian entree There are a good amount of vegetables bathed in a wonderfully creamy pesto sauce It's a very satisfying dish- Ancho Chilli- Rubbed Filet: My husband loves this dish He says the flavors are amazing and the meat is cooked perfectly I can attest that the side dishes it comes with are delicious.
4636,It's hard to use so many great ingredients and still have the food come out bland but the Donkey pulls it off   Perhaps there is some special process that bleeds the flavor from Hatch Green Chilis that only the Donky know aboutThe tort of  enchiladas was thicker than the quilt grandma made me up In Minnesota  The beans were tasty all 2 ounces of them     The bar waitress was so unattentive I had to call the restaurant on my cell and ask for a watiress to be sent to my table   Gotta love those empty headed Scottsdale bimbosAll in all I would say it is a great restaurnant for Scottsdale gringos who have no idea what real southwestern food tastes like and don't care or about freindly service so long as the building is fancy and they can tell their friends they went to the latest trendy spotThis one will be GONE in a year.
4116,"This location sucks balls One of the guys walked off in the middle of taking my order because I didn't instantly respond with what drink I wanted for my combo I literally glanced up for a second to see what they had and apparently that inconvenienced him He handed the order slip to another guy standing next to him and said ""Here you finish this order"" and walked off The guy taking over wasn't a doll either He took my cash gave me my change and closed the screen door on me without any ""thank you"" or anything On to the food Now I never really like Pete's to begin with but I'll go because my BF loves it I think mainly because he grew up eating Pete's so it has become somewhat a childhood nostalgia I don't like their fish at all but I find their shrimps decent so that's what I usually get The shrimps I got here were over battered and overcooked though I had to tear off all the edges on them because they were way too hard to chew Bad food and bad service I will never come here again Go to the Mesa one or according to my BF the ""real deal Pete's"" on Central in S Phx."
1687,Breakfast or brunch at lon's is consistently delicious Good service Great ambience Solid menu Priced right for food and experience  Go when you have time to relax and take in the experience.
907,The person above with 'duplicate review' has a link to a different restaurant  This is Hana Japanese Eatery on 7th StCorkage byobThis is my favorite sushi/japanese restaurant in town right now  Unfortunately they do not serve alcohol but you can bring your own sake wine or beer (just stop at AJ's on Camelback and Central on your way in)  Incredibly fresh and delicious sashimi and sushi always fabulous specials on the board and interesting items like fresh halibut or red striped bass really make for some great sashimi  Service can be excellent to horrible (had a very bad server at lunch once) but is normally excellent this is a family run business and the Japanese influence is seen in the fabulous dishes  Make sure you order your favorite sushi rolls or sashimi even if it isn't on the short menu  They are glad to make anything you ask for if they have it available  I had one of the best salmon skin handrolls i've had anywhere in the world here  And the tuna tataki with crunchy roasted garlic was out of this world  I'm a sashimi lover but these specials on the board have to be ordered because they are that good   One night they had a special seaweed with lemon peel and green onions that I will order any time I see it available amazing flavor and texture very japanese  mmmmNot open for lunch on Saturday or Sunday closed on Mondays  Regular hours through the week.
351,Possibly the best burger I've ever had--definitely the best I've had in PhoenixI get the classic which comes on brioche with a choice of cheese It's the only thing I've ever ordered there because it's so damn good I can't pass it up AND they get their beef from humanely raised grass-fed cows And beer selection and the fries with aioli Well others here have told you how good they arePro tip Throw a little of that aioli on your burger too Oh and come hungry--it's a generously sized burgerIt's a little pricey but Delux is a really delicious treat.
4254,Food was Pretty good beer was cold but service was shitty at best.
2186,"Wow Just happened to be on the East side and googled best breakfast on East side This place came up and after looking at the menu decided to try it out We are so happy we did BEST breakfast we have ever had And we've been to many of ""the best of"" breakfast places Such creative ingredients not the same old boring breakfast items that you see everyplace else Our breakfast took awhile to come out but we didn't care we were enjoying a delicious Bloody Mary Our waitress was awesome and apologized several times for the wait and upon paying the bill she gave us a complimentary muffin their signature bran muffin We split it for breakfast the next day and it was wonderful Can't wait to go back here LOVE."
3091,"Service ApocalypseTo the feather flying' fedora-wearing I'm-going-to-wear-a-vest-and-long-sleeves-even-though-it's-still-hot-out and-it's-not-1922 hipster server:Go to your local library Pick up some literature on proper etiquette Might I suggest Emily PostUh Oh  Too much text for your weary hipster eyes Spent all day giving customers the stink-eye didn't you OK I'll break it down for you:1 When people sit down at a table try to greet them If you're super tied up between checking up on other tables and checking your appearance in the mirror then maybe just let that table know that you are busy and that you will be with them shortly Because after we were seated at our table almost 10 minutes went by - no waiter nothing We were beginning to get worried We thought perhaps you had been kidnapped We called the authorities but we had little information to go off of since you never came by and said ""hi"" We described you as a tall malnourished hipster wearing teen-girl skinny jeans an overwhelming ensemble of man accessories and air of mismatched cocky arrogance for a 30 year old dude at the lower end of the service industry Unfortunately that description did us no good in the neighborhood of CenPho  but luckily when we were just about at our wits' end you showed up hunched over scowl on your face (if this is in preparation for your costume as a zombie you are rocking it)2 When you serve people drinks let them finish said drinks before hastily removing them from the table If they kindly ask you for their drinks back try not to be an ass 3 When customers order dinner try not to take so long so as to confuse them into thinking it's breakfast 4 When the food is served maybe don't go MIA Maybe check back in with them Maybe they want dessert for  wait what time is it now lunch  OK I'll stop there I know how valuable time is to the pretentious staff at the Windsor Those cigarettes aren't going to smoke themselves Well congratulations From now on we will avoid your restaurant like you avoid a real job."
1067,I've been here a handful of times already since they've opened I believe in June or July At first I was skeptical about the place they seemed a tad unorganized (but every starting business is) their lunch menu isn't too bad they have THREE sushi rolls for only $10 ( although there is a list for you to choose from) the sushi here isn't too bad but yet I haven't tried anything too fancy The only time I had lunch here it wasn't too busy I was taken care of pretty well by Vivi although I did need to ask her to fill up my glass a few timesThe next couple of times I've came were all weekends HECTIC I went there Friday night and they were slammed Good thing my party did make a reservation ahead of time ( highly recommended ) even though we did have to wait a few minutes to be seated it was definitely better than the hour wait that some people had There was a huge crowd in front of the door and it was pretty hard to spot the hostesses to check in but it eventually happened Tiffany which seemed to be the only hostess was very accommodating and helpful and sat us fairly quick As we were seated we were greeted within 2-3 minutes by our wonderful server Kathy I ordered the Ocrean Trio which included lobster tail scallops and shrimp for $36 and it also came with soup and salad fried rice veggies and two pcs of shrimp I say that's a great deal Our teppan chef David was very funny and entertaining and cooked everything to order Our server Kathy was excellent She was very good with refilling drinks there were times that I didn't even know she took my glass to refill it I never had a half empty glass Even though she was slammed with other tables across the room she always came and checked on us with a smile Restaurant itself is very well decorated bathrooms were tidy you can choose to sit in regular dining or teppan side Atmosphere is great eventhough it's a tad crowded on weekends but that's what makes it funThanks TonyI definitely will continue coming I hope this great place will last in Mesa.
1969,"Went to eat there after hearing about how good their strip steak was We were staying at the pointe and had our two kids and two of their friends with us  After being seated by a nice host we were greeted by our server She seemed some what rushed although there was no wait tonight After letting the kids and my wife order I requested the strip steak I was informed there was none left  I was given no alternative or substitute which left me with a choice of doubling my meal price to a 24oz rib steak or something else Well the only reason I chose this place was because of the steak So after I gave the server some time to offer an alternative she just left with everyones order but mine  After no service for around 10 min I finally asked for the manager He was nice but offered no solution other than I order the $46-$48 steak or I could wait while he gets a steak from another restaurant  Which was nice but meant I eat after my family was already done eating I suggested giving my the rib steak as a half portion and he answered me with ""then what do I do with the other half of the steak"" I could not believe he actually said that So with my wife and  4 kids finished eating I was just getting my meal When the bill came is expected some sort of courtesy (maybe comp some of the beverages)  nope In fact we were charged full price for everything and had a 18% gratuity added to the bill already I was hoping maybe it was just a server having an off day but when the manager see's fit to make a comment like ""what do you expect me to do with the other half of the steak"" I am convinced it is more about poor leadershipOverall the experience was very bad the service was poor and we will never again eat there In fact I will be telling everyone that I know not to eat there We will eat off property during our next stay at the pointe squaw peak."
2283,Coldwell Banker has been instrumental in our transition from Mesa AZ to Sturgeon Bay WI Our Coldwell Banker Marc Maryland in Mesa referred us to Doris Bodener in Sturgeon Bay to help us purchase our new house She has our best interests at heart After several showings and some of repeat showings we finally found our home Thank you Coldwell Banker for an outstanding job.
169,If you enjoy (and really who doesn't) amazing and fresh produce wild caught meats etc then definitely check out the Old Town Farmer's Market every Saturday from 8am to 1pm We've been a few times already and need to get a 2nd produce only fridge in the near future as we come home with way to much each time McClendon's Farm is the main produce provider at the Old Town Farmer's Market and some of the best produce I have seenIf you go make sure to bring your reusable environmental friendly bags to put all your produce into If you forget they have plastic bags Really fun walking around to meet the other local vendors try out their delicious foods and get outdoors in downtown Scottsdale.
2677,There are deals a-plenty at the Peter Piper Pizza during the lunch hour on weekdays at this location  While traveling through the Grand Canyon State and checking out the Ice Den practice home of the Phoenix Coyotes (nee Winnipeg Jets) I stumbled upon this hidden gem in the desert  This is well-kept and clean pizza place  And the deal for all you can eat pizza salad and cinnamon twist with drink cost less than $7  There is a bar here and had the Blue Moon on Tap  Folks for all of your nostalgic needs there is PBR (Pabst Blue Ribbon) on tap too  Jarrod the restaurant manager served us promptly and efficiently  The pizza was not bad as it hit the spot after watching the Coyotes practice  Beer is served cold with an orange garnish well-cut and placed on top of the foam of the beer  That's cool if it is cut right  Surprising all of the games worked and was surprised that the selection of prizes were pretty good  Lighting was sufficient and there are ample tables and booths available  It was too cold to dine al fresco that day  At this location there was a steady stream for lunch as there are businesses close by the restaurant  This is a place that is great for kids  Even if I don't have any young tykes running around this deal is hard to beat  I shall return.
2837,This place really sucks I went in there to rent equipment and the staff acted like they didnt want to help anyone out I mean I know working sucks but come on it's your job So I give this place one star for the staff being rude and the fact that i had to go to the Ski Pro in Mesa to rent the clothes that fit me In the end I wish I had rented everything from the Ski Pro in Mesa Mesa Ski Pro is a lot more polite and will be more than willing to help you find what you need.
3496,Well guys I dont have much to say thats gonna be nice about this place My dinner here was like someone used my tortilla as toilet paper threw some cheese in it rolled it up and stuck it on my plate Just in case I was not sure of the flavor i was experincing the stuck a nice big spoonfull of what was in my tortilla on my plate and called it beans The only thing mexican about the food is they say its mexican and perhaps they keep their tortillias in the bathroom (kitchen) to use as toilet paper and cut down their cost and staffing of a real cook.
626,In September 2008 I went to a pastry cooking class hereIt was at nighttime  55$ a person  from 6-9pmWe show up and the pastry chef was the pastry chef from Cowboy CiaoOMG IwassoexcitedI'm such a huge fan of the pastries at Cowboy Ciao since they're unique and weird and awesomeOk so the class was super fun  We had like five or six different recipes  We broke off into groups and each picked the recipe we wanted to makeWe made them with the help of the chefIt was fun we were all talking  They provide wine and iced tea and water to drinkThen OF COURSE  Once they're all done YOU EAT AND EAT AND EAT until you can eat no moreAwesomenessI really had a great time  Really.
2971,Amazing  We stayed at the Biltmore over Christmas with an all-inclusive package  With this package we were able to try a large variety of items on the menu  The staff was incredibly friendly and recognized us by the 2nd day  The first day we started off with the smashed avocados  Great flavor - def not boring  We also tried the pulled pork empanadas  Not too much flavor but not bad either  During our stay we tried the pizza (late night and the pie was HUGE) the Burger (awesome taste) and the chicken and goat cheese flat  All were very well prepared and had great flavor  So maybe the reason the cheese pizza was incredible was because it was after cocktails but really not bad for a resortDefinitely need to try the FF prepared in duck fat  We tried this one and the sea salt fries  They were both good but the duck fat fries had just that little something extraWe ate Christmas dinner at F&A's also  Very good again  The best part was the table-side smores  Overall our experiences were wonderful  Even though most of our meals were eaten here there is still more on the menu I'd like to try.
4259,Tried calling last week and the phone number was disconnected but the website was still up  Tried the website this morning to try to contact them again and it's now gone  Those of us who still have certificates from buywithmecom are out our money  From the sounds of the reviews I wouldn't have much cleaner of a house had they come out anyway.
1519,Never been here before You walk up and order It was fast The burgers were unexpectedly great and the 'Turtle Sundae' was off the charts Kids that work there are polite and smile Makes me feel warm and fuzzy.
2925,They have awesomely flavored ice creams But that's not even the best part about this place It's always clean and cheerful inside the store The workers are kind and friendly and it comes from a genuine satisfaction and pride they have from working there My family loves going to Scooptacular because we always have fun there There was never a time that we were disappointed at all I would not be surprised when my daughter becomes an adult and looks back at fond memories of her childhood Scooptacular would be definitely be a part of it.
1490,Finding the address is easy (just follow 7th Street) finding the restaurant a little trickier as you have to drive past the entrance to the hotel first and not be tempted to nab one of the open parking spots - you've got a ways to go yet Keep ascending and eventually when your car has almost given out on you you'll find Different Point of View Valet was free and friendly Up one flight of stairs and you'll find yourself in the bar Up one more flight of stairs and you'll find the restaurantD√©cor is classy but a little dated Of course not many people will be looking at the furniture when they see the view A floor to ceiling glass window facing south with downtown Phoenix in the distance We were lucky enough to get one of the tables by the window as we had an earlier reservation (6:30) in order to see the sunset There is a patio outside which would be a great location to sit and watch the sun go down if only it wasn't 110 outsideThe wine list is very good and expansive There seems to be something for everyone from multiple thousand dollar bottles of Premier Cru Bordeauxs to more affordable domestic wines The only comment I would make is that there wasn't as much variety in the by-the-glass selectionIn addition the the regular menu they offer a three course prix fixe deal for $40  - select the options that are printed in red and the selections were surprisingly good The second prix fixe option is the Chef's choice seven course meal for $79pp with the option to add a wine pairing for an additional $29pp The table next to ours had the Chef's choice and it seemed to be a great deal We weren't that hungry and the OH wasn't drinking so we chose the 3-course menuFor apps the OH ordered the watermelon salad which was good but a little boring A slice of seared watermelon and some mustard greens or rape I ordered the lobster bisque and thought it was excellent but would have liked to have seen some lobster meat instead of everything being pur√©ed It had a great flavourFor entr√©es I had the daily addition which tonight was Beef Short Ribs - delectable melt in your mouth amazing She ordered the Trout which was perfectly cooked and served on a bed of shrimp and enoki mushroomsDessert was Classic Tahitian Vanilla Bean Cr√®me Brulee and Chocolate Turtle They were both good but the cr√®me brulee was in a league of it's own You can see why it is their signature dessertService was very good and my water glass was never close to empty Luis was our server and he told us he had worked there for 11 years he said there were other servers who had worked there for much longer His service was very professional although a little pandering at timesSummary - This is a great place for a date night It's romantic the service is good the food very good and the view spectacular You should go.
4494,"There are much better and cheaper options for gyms in the tempe area  My biggest complaints are the lack of cleanliness and the overall condition The lobby and general areas all look nice but I've often found the locker rooms to be dirty Additionally the cardio machines are often sticky and sweaty GrossOn the plus side the pool is great and it's large enough that finding a machine isn't a problem My biggest complaint has come after I cancelled my membership I get almost weekly calls letters and emails asking me to re-join I've asked to be removed from their mailing list but it doesn't seem to work Somehow the message of ""Leave me alone I'm happy with my new gym"" isn't getting through."
2144,Words cannot describe how much I adore this place Over the past month I think I've been here at LEAST once a week John and Dave are the best bartenders around - always so accommodating and friendly My friend is Italian and has grown up drinking negronis (I'm not a fan but she is) and is pretty picky about how they're made John does is perfectly I always get either a Moscow or a Gin Fizz - they're always delicious The tots and duck fat fries are delicious I mostly drink when I'm here but I've had a few things I've tried their pork belly BLT toopreeetyyy damn good It's not a super busy place and I'd prefer it stay that way I probably shouldn't even be reviewing this place since I don't want a bunch of people there crowding my space and I really don't want the Scottsdale douchers coming through here.
4587,I went to eat here today because I was in the mood for something different and did not want to go far I should have stuck with Cheba Hut I ordered a burger and fries The burger meat was probably OK but whatever cheese they use on their burgers was disgusting It tasted like the $099 cheese that you but when you are a few days away from payday and need something to go on your bologna sandwiches I would highly recommend that you avoid this place I have never been somewhere that screws up a simple burger this bad Never eating here again.
2751,This might be an odd review because I didn't actually go on a ride with them but I want to give them a positive shout out for solid customer service  Long story short I work in media as does my wife and we each did a story with them  They were very helpful and the customers I spoke with were very stoked on the ride and with them  That's part one  I was SO impressed I bought a gift certificate with them for a present for my wife  We had bad luck such as super high winds (cancelled) and emergency surgery ( cancelled) then I had a job transfer out of the area  We were in a very unique situation and we were able to work it out and I just want to thank them  A solid group and businessif something goes awry I feel confident they will work with you  That's it.
3220,I haven't yet tried Takamatsu Korean food so this review is strictly for their sushi The honest truth is this place has the WORST sushi I have ever had in my life It was a disappointment to say the least even for an all you can eat place (which aren't very good most of the time) The sushi had way too much rice three times the normal The fish was not fresh and the mix of flavors were weird One roll I tried was the volcano roll which was four pieces of thinly sliced riced with a small center of cream cheese sitting in a pile of pungent garlic oil and had an off sour taste to it We tried four rolls and most did not contain all the ingredients mentioned in the description so I don't know if they ran out of ingredients or what The reason for only trying four rolls is because those were the first round and after trying them we were so disgusted we couldn't order more We also tried the shrimp tempura and I think they used the wrong sort of batter because it had a soft and chewy texture to it The gyoza dumplings were very greasy and had minimum filling Overall I wouldn't recommend the sushi here to my worst enemy This is a Korean restaurant and they should stick to what they do best.
3674,Doctors are Great- and have been for my kids for the Past 25 Years BUT the STAFF IS not only Incompetent- Now Days But also LIARS and I withdrew my son from being a patient there-  I was told I cussed the staff out   What    My oldest is now 25 and had gone there also since he was a baby.
4469,What a rip-off After looking on line at times and prices I bought 5 tickets to bring my kids here They say that the park opens at 10am but that is just mini golf Rides don't open until 5pm We wasted an hour drive and $150 to not be able to go on any rides.
2204,I LOOOOOOOOOVVVVVVVVVEEEEEE Frances There is no better place to find unique gifts for others or for that most special person yourself They have such a wide range of beautiful things here (some of my favs include: Kamibashi stationary and stickers (oh so many cool stickers) jewelery by local artists unique baby and kid stuff yummy smelling lotions Anthropologie-esque dresses) and hello vintage clothes yay How cool is that Having 2 kids it is nearly impossible for me to really shop in here for very long I am considering hiring a babysitter just to go in here for 2 hours and pour over everything I heart Frances forever and always PLEASE shop here and support a wonderful local business I can't wait for that light rail to be up so I can ride it to FrancesEdit: I forgot to say that Frances is also a great place to go for a gift for the man in your life (well maybe not if the man in your life is your dad) but for virtually any other man in your life go to Frances they have great guy clothes and manly toiletries.
3441,Just came back from that festival I don t want to be bad We are from Europe This is a real joke Between charlemagne ( 8th century) the elephants and the renaissance it is almost 600 years between  You pay 20 dollars for what Park your car maybe in rocksyou must pay everything inside 1 dol to 6 dol at least Just for rides Family of 6 It hurts + food(awfull) drinks( I am not sure they put any alcohol in the cocktails($6 each) Go once and never go back Good luck.
2058,For a Bar Zuma has some excellent food Not the typical bar menu We try to eat at Zuma when we are in downtown Tempe or before events/concerts etc the Management and Bar Staff are very social and friendly etc  Love the bottomless Mimosa specials on weekendsHave not been there for the nightlife/late night but I hear they pack em in.
1682,I have to give another yelp out to Jeff and A 1 Minute Key Service Jeff changed out my locks earlier this year (see previous review) and I recently needed his services again I locked my keys in the house on a Saturday while my husband and I were outside Jeff was on his way to another call and then came straight over He let us in and even fixed a lock that had been sticking due to the warming weather while he was at it I can't say enough great things about him and his services He's the only locksmith you'll ever need.
1218,This is by far the best tanning salon I have ever been a member ofThe staff is friendly and helpful and their salon is beautiful and totally customer oriented  They REALLY don't skip out on anything with their customersYou'll be happy to find some Hempz lotion in the bathroom for your convenience to use after you tan - complimentaryThey're prices are incredibly reasonable and they don't try to screw you over like a lot of tanning places do  I have nothing but great things to say about this place  I moved from Chandler 2 years ago and have been to 4 other salons in Tempe and now Los Angeles where I live and never have any of them met the same standards I experienced hereVery very sad to have left.
204,Thank you yelpers  I was looking for great Mexican food and you guys and gals were great  We came here Friday after a game and I was impressedTo begin it is not a sit down restaraunt  You place your order at the counter then find a table  I ordered the carne asada tacos and they were awesome  They had onions and cilantro  The slasa was great  These little tacos were a great way to end the day  Now if they sold tequila it would be perfect  But I do recomend it for those who want delicious tacos.
1186,Well I debated writing my review for this place because it happened a few years ago but I still boycott it to this day so here goes I went here to meet some friends and bought a quesadilla Nothing special but still good I paid with my debit card and tipped the waiter $1 on the receipt I was given to sign After looking over my checking account a week or so later I discovered that my tip had magically gone from $1 to $700 Now ordinarily one would think there was a mistake in my handwriting however I had also totaled the amount on that same receipt for the cost of the food and the tip so there was no way my math was off by $600 I contacted the bar several times and gave them copies of my receipt that I signed and they did nothing about it They never returned my calls or offered to refund the money How big of a deal do you make over $600 I gave up but vowed to never return to this place again If you do go do NOT under any circumstance use a debit or credit card and if you do watch your bills like a hawk for unscrupulous accounting errors.
1203,"This place is just hands down exquisite White Salmon Start to finish I can't say a bad thing about this place The decor is impressive and the drinks awesome They have a $360000 Seafood Tower appetizer if you have that kinda cash I gotta say though if they ever offer it to you as a special ""White Salmon""  Get it It was like candy Never had anything like it UNREAL Now I'm hungry."
702,Chicken quesadilla chicken fajitas - sucked The chicken was flavorless and dry In fact it tasted as if it was microwaved/ pre-packaged And waaaay to expensive Will not eat at this chain again.
3569,My husband and I love pho We are new to the area and have been trying out different restaurants Last weekend we decided to try this place for lunch The one star is for the awful service We were seated fairly quickly but it was at least 10 minutes before we were brought menus We waited another 10 - 15 minutes and still no water no one to take our ordernothing The restaurant was steady but not busy The employees seemed to be completely unengaged I can't remember the last time we walked out of a restaurant but after waiting close to a half an hour we decided to cut our losses and try another place We ended up at Saigon Pho which was wonderful - excellent food and service There are too many great places to eat in the Phoenix area to ever give this place a try again.
3755,Great hotel with a superb bar and restaurant (Sushi Roku) but our stay was heavily tarnished by our experience of the poolUnfortunately the W has cashed in on the Vegas party pool idea and lets wannabes who aren't staying in the hotel turn up and reserve the loungers This meant that I had to pay $50 for my gf and I to lie in the sunYou would have thought that paying guests would get priority but it seems like every skank and db in Scottsdale is more important.
2784,"Nostalgic trip down memory lane We went there early June of last year for 5 days Beautiful upscale resort with gorgeous landscape Having a daily view of the Camelback mountain right at your window was just splendidand prob gave this place an edge over all the others The resort is so huge it's like its own little suburbia They  have little ""golf carts"" to ride members to their room pool  lounge areas the spa or simply the parking lot out front A car is a definite must  Not that you can't walk around the compound We did a nice hiking trail up to Mummy Mountain (see pics) The rooms more like private units were incredibly spacious with king size comfy beds Equipped with regular TV small fridge and microwave Honestly I could have stayed inside our casita all dayHad great dinner at BLT steak restaurant Side bread consisted of a huge popover Gruyere Steaks were juicy and full of flavor Service was top notch Dining facing  a drop-dead gorgeous mountain view What more can you ask for from life Our last morning also had an amazing breakfast at Rita's Kitchen on the resort We frequented the famous Spa during our stay Very calm and serene We didn't get any fancy massages but we did lounge around the pool Felt like I was living the life of a celebrity Will always cherish this resort since we got engaged during our stay there Lovely memories."
2603,I really love PF ChangsAnd no I don't think its really authentic and that is not even a reason why I love this place So without further ado my four favorite dishesFirst: PF Changs has the BEST chicken noodle soup EVER Forget the egg drop forget the hot and sour try this delicious soup It's a lemony spicy-ish chicken broth with cherry tomatoes mushrooms pieces of chicken cilantro and these weird looking noodles It might not sound good but TRUST ME it isSecond:  the fried green beansYUMMY Super crunchy and delicious and the dipping sauce is phenomenalThird: shrimp and candied walnuts OK I never thought I would like a dish with melon balls in it [unless it was like a fruit bowl] but this has definitely changed my mind Basically battered and fried shrimp with this creamy sauce with candied walnuts and melon balls I can't convince you it's good with any of my words you just need to try it lolFourth: Dalhi Chicken It's super spicy [spiciest dish] with sliced potatoes If you don't like spicy DON'T GET THIS Try the chang's spicy chicken instead [which is not spicy to me] lolYOU'RE WELCOME ].
3920,"I am sitting in the parking lot writing this review because the service and quality of food annoyed me so much that I didn't even want to wait until I got home I understand that it's a weekend and busy but after waiting for ice and iced tea to be filled/brewed given an attitude by a server when I asked a question and waited 30 minutes for my to-go sandwich I think their ""it's busy"" excuse is void Here is my experience with the restaurant inside the QC Olive Mill:There are signs on the wall stating that orders are made fresh and take time so I didn't want to be pushy about my sandwich But when I noticed about 5 other people pick up their order who had ordered after me I decided to finally ask Oh don't worry it had only been sitting on the line for the last 20 minutes because they ""lost the ticket"" Hello didn't you see a customer standing there patiently waiting and looking slightly confused Did you think to ask if the sandwich was hers From someone who worked in the restaurant industry lack of a sense of urgency is unacceptable When I finally got my order all they gave me was a ""sorry"" and a $1000 sandwich that resembled the size of a hockey puck All in all I'm mad I made the drive out here and should have just stopped at the Firehouse Subs I passed on my way."
2594,BEST PLACE EVER I love coming here love the selection and low prices.
3833,"HORRIBLE SERVICEWe can't go back there Went there for the first time tonight and was expecting great food We walked in no one came up to greet us Instead they stayed back behind the counter and told us to sit anywhere without any kind of courtesy or etiquette Our waitress definitely did not want to be there and had an attitude We picked a table and sat down They were slow to give us our menus We got our food quick enough and it was tasty but definitely not better than Lolo's The waitress never came back to ask if we need anything else or to fill our water or lemonade glasses We had to shout across the dining room to get her attention for more lemonade The absolute worst was when we went up to pay they never handed us a bill and overcharged us The old man at the register didn't even know what we ordered and when we told him just spat out a number ""$3316"" without doing any kind of math He was very rude to my boyfriend who tried to pay with a credit card Instead of just asking my boyfriend if he had cash he barked ""Didn't you see the sign We take cash"" We didn't make a scene but it really pissed us off Their signage is confusing There was a broken machine sign on the wall but the menu said ""we are now accept credit and debit cards"" Also the place is filthy Dirty floors walls and windows The bathroom smells like hot ass For some reason the bathrooms don't have AC but the rest of the restaurant does Absolute worst We've had great food and service at Lolo's They definitely know how to make you feel welcomed I love the servers at Lolo's they are attentive friendly and helpful I can't believe the two families are related WE WILL NEVER GO BACK."
903,Mucho Gusto has the Best Fish Tacos in town From the moment you are greateted at the door you can feel the lively energy that radiates from this place Great tunes & great ambiance with a friendly & hip staff If you need a thirst quencher for the Hot summer Mucho Gusto has the most delicious Margaritas & Iced Tea to cool you off I will for sure be returning to this place soon to get my fish taco fix.
3069,"Was in the area so my friend and I came here for lunch  I ordered the Korean dish bi bim bap  It was sooo good  Just like my mom makes it  The only difference is the red chili paste sauce they give you is far less spicy then it would normally be  They modified to satisfy those who are not used to the ""ethnic hot"" as I like to call it  I wish they had a location closer to me  I crave the food here all the time."
756,I was a bit skeptical of Postino because I had heard so many great things about it and didn't really understand how bruschetta could be that great but now I'm a believer It's the whole package of the location the vibe the constant crowd and of course - the amazing food I ordered a board of bruschetta planning to split it with my friend but then remembered she is unable to have gluten It was so delicious that I finished the whole board by myself I just couldn't say no to the brie apple & fig or red peppers & goat cheese or prosciutto fig & marscapone or the burrata bacon arugula & tomatoes My fave of these four was the brie apple & fig Deeee-lish.
47,So excited that Rita's has finally come to the Valley  I grew up on Rita's in PA and always thought it would be a hit in the Valley since we have year round fantastic weather  The staff was extremely nice and were also excited when I told them I grew up with Rita's italian ice  The mango gelati is still my favoriteyummy.
2027,Never Again My husband and I decided to try this place because we were in the area and wanted hot pho on a cold night My pho was terrible The broth tasted like it was ramen noodle broth which if you've had good pho you know should never be the case And then to make the experience even worst a cockroach started to crawl on our table and almost into our food The server who I believe is also the owner came to check on what was wrong and when we told her there was a cockroach her suggestion was we move to another table But at that point we had already lost our appetites We paid and left The server/owner apologized again as we were leaving but I was surprised she didn't comp our meal being that we didn't really eat If you want pho I suggest you go somewhere else where there is some attempt in making it taste authentic As for the cockroach wellI know Vietnamese restaurants are kind of notorious for being dirty so that should be your call if it's a deal breaker.
1889,Purchased a LocalDine and was anxious to try the place  Went on Fri 5/24/13  to find out that their contract expired on 5/20 so they would not honor my July expiration coupon  Food was very mediocre and not impressed with any of our three choices  One slice of turkey in a $9 sandwich  Yikes  We will not return.
2050,I love Fuddruckers because I can put my own toppings on including gooey melty fake cheese  Also they have frings (a combo of fries and onion rings)  Very tasty.
248,Great little space Go see the Christopher Jagmin show right now His colorful slightly loopy encaustic paintings are a great reminder that life is fun dammit and art can be too.
353,Aside from the couple of negative reviews that I have read this place is as good as it gets for a combination of good people good service good food good entertainment and good prices  I especially enjoy their Karaoke on Tuesday night  Very friendly atmosphere where everyone knows everyone else  I highly recommend this restaurant for an all around enjoyable evening.
746,What a day brightenerSleep deprived and in a post-delivery fog upon coming home from the hospital after the birth of my daughter I was the recipient of a gorgeous assortment of flowers and an adorable stuffed animal from Flora Unique FloristThey were definitely unique and fun and are still going strong a week after deliveryI hadn't heard of this florist before but I will be using them in the future when it's time for me to send flowers to someone locally for sureThanks FUF for the awesome surprise and thanks to my work team for sending them too :).
3970,THEY'VE CLOSED Such a huge disappointment Made lunch plans with a coworker today who suggested we try it out since we liked The Grind (next door same owner) The place was empty at 12:45 on a Friday Glad it wasn't crowded but it could have been a sign of things to come We had a pleasant waiter who seemed excited to see us We started out by ordering the Stuffed Biscuit Bites because the description seemed great: Chorizo Manchengo Cheese Garlic Cream Sauce and Herbs We were told it was taken off the menu because it didn't really taste very good So we decided to try the Fried Pickle Chips instead I ordered a pulled pork sandwich with a side of chips and my friend ordered the pulled chicken and a side salad Let's start with the Fried Pickle Chips They were terribly sour dill slices cut way to thick with the batter sliding off each one Just dreadful When the sandwiches arrived we were taken aback by how little meat was on each one At $8 we could have used a few more ounces It was probably less than 3 oz of meat The barbecue chicken was flavorless and oddly textured The pulled pork was slightly better but very bland They were both pretty dismal Luckily our waiter brought over some Madison's Habenaero sauce by a local bottler It is very tangy mildly hot and a bit sweet If it weren't for this the sandwiches would have been left uneaten.
1917,Whenever the need arises to wash my vehicleAnd I'm in the mood for delicious slow roasted brisket ribs or pulled porkAnd I need to pick through the convenience store-like grocery case for some Nestle's Strawberry milkAnd I want to watch international soccer games in the car wash waiting area after the pulled porkwith a flavorful Starbuck's-like coffee creation from the coffee bar while my vehicleremember my vehiclethe one that needed cleaningis getting cleaned I come hereTom's Thumb Fresh MarketWhere I can satiate all my worldly needs in one fell swoopsave for getting laidBut I'm guessing if one got really creative he/she could throw-down somewhere on this huge property If you are going to have a go at it I wouldn't use the men's room thoughIt smells kind-of weirdcould sour the mood From this reviewer's perspective the only thing missing is a place to take a nap after getting laidA short nap after a furious jaunt is always refreshing and I think the proprietors could have thought through this a little more carefully when building their business plan because had they done so this place would be perfect in my book A place to get my truck washed eat barbecue drink a beer watch soccer drink latte's along with a fuck and a short nap followed by the attendant tossing me my keys Now that's the shitI'd like to summarize by suggesting how this place may very well be a mere fuck and a short nap away from heaven.
1831,"This review is not in reference to Bink's food or service it is in reference to being lied to by Bink's employees My family stopped by for lunch yesterday with our new tiny poodle puppy in tow and requested seating on the patio Our puppy all of 3 pounds would stay on my lap the entire time We were told no only service dogs allowed on the patio due to ""health codes"" Now I 100% support a cafe owner's right to make their own policies regarding dogs on patios but it angers me to be lied to because (as a dog owner) I know for a fact there are no ""health codes"" locally in Carefree or state-wide about this within five minutes of Bink's turning us away we were seated on the patio at Carefree's sundial cafe surrounded by family's with dogs about to have lunch Kevin man up and tell your employees not to condescend to the public and tell the truth about your policies."
3235,"Disgusting If I wanted reheated food I would have got a TV dinner for cheaper My beans were burnt around the edges and you couldn't pick up the bowl it was so hot Also our ""waiter"" waited on us twice to take our order and get payment We waited 15min for him just to bring the check."

4785,very sad this store went out of business.
1456,I figured there would be a bunch of college chicks drinking beer here There was not They had Left Hand Stout on draft which is alright Where the hell were all of the college girls I didn't get to creep any of them out.
119,We are definitely regulars at this Nello's location  The service is friendly  We almost always get a nice cozy booth to sit in  The pizza is great and so are the sandwiches  They are really  accommodating when it comes to making special requests  Their house dressing is not just good for salads - get some to dip your sandwich and pizza bites inGood beer list and inexpensive prices You really can't go wrong with Nello's.
4230,The Vine Tavern (i'll omit the word Eatery as i'm fairly certain this term can't be applied to the food they serve at this establishment) is a vortex sort of culmination hang-out for low-brow Fred Durst clones and future (day-shift) strippers With that being said this cesspool of a building hasn't burned to the ground yet so I feel compelled to warn others before they consider spending an evening thereBeing new to the Tempe area myself and a small group of friends decided to drop in to check it out  As we approached the-dimly lit building I began to have second thoughts: my bloomy sense was tingling (more on this later) As we entered we were greeted by a lovely bouncer type gentlemen who begged us to pay the 5$ cover seriously We were seated towards the back near a group of teenage mothers and their burly counterparts We ordered foodThe food arrived in a timely manner it may have been poisoned but i was too hungry to care I ordered the mushroom/swiss burger 9 dollars-ish If Mcdonalds ever begins selling their products in the frozen food aisle of grocery stores it might taste something like what they serve at The Vine I had immediate food regret my only consolation was the 1$ you call its and the poor old man behind the mic with his acoustic guitar wrapping up his set Surreal   We regrettably paid and escaped out the back Good: Cheap Drinks   Bad: You may be stabbed.
4148,I called ahead and made a 3:30 appointment for a haircut so I wouldn't have to wait I arrived on time and told the receptionist that I had an appointment with Kelli Rather than tell Kelli I was there waiting this arrogant woman ignored me and continued to talk on the phone for maybe 10 minutes before I got angry and left No way would I go back to this business They are obviously unable to hire front-desk employees with a minimum level of competence.
1108,Stopped by for lunch today and loved it Quick attentive service and the food was excellent I had the sushi lunch with a salad added Simple salad and the dressing is sooo yummy - just perfect Spicy Tuna Sushi was the best I ever had Hubby chose the tempura and a salmon and avocado sashimi - he thought it was spectacular I am sure we will be there again and again in the future - what a find.

2954,This is the place you go when your looking for a band tee or poster or stickers or hats or anything else you can possibly think of that you might need to buy your band stuff on haha In all seriousness this place has everything for the person that doesn't want the same cookie cutter bs clothes in the mall I love this place In all honesty I've bought my shirts here for the past 3-4 yearsonly here If your looking for anything dark rockabilly gothish different then this is the place for you They also have baby and toddler sized stuff too to rock your kid out hahaha.
3357,we went to STFK for the first and unfortunately the last time tonight I'm not sure if they hired an outside company to come up with this concept or they thought of it internally but they can save a ton of money by NOT remodeling the remaining stores and will stop losing long time customers like us  I always finished up with their chili but now it's an additional $349 and no more hot chocolate chip cookies BTW no more coupons either so it's time to look for another place to have a healthy meal.
4709,I don't get the obsession with this place The tortillas are fresh but other than that everything is literally dripping in grease but not much flavor Service is also slow considering it is set up as fast food Plus any place that closes on Sunday gets an automatic loss of a star from me.
187,OkMy experiences at Sam Fox restaurants have covered the spectrum but today North really delivered   The dishes and the execution were 100% on point  I started with the seasonal vegetable salad Beets Carrots Radishes Kale Romaine Dried Fruit Farro Marcona Almonds Pecorino and White Balsamic Dressing  One of the best salads I have had in a long timegreat flavor and texture combinationsand perfectly dressed  The Burger and The Spaghetti and Meatballs were also home runs  I would dare say Best Spaghetti in town  High quality thick pasta prepared perfectly al dente with a little chewiness and a lusciously rich perfectly balanced tomato sauce with herbs and parmesan  It was phenomenal   The burger was also fantasticgreat bun and flavorful toppings  The crispy potatoes  are wonderfully preparedget them  I would like to thank whomever created and executed these dishes in the kitchen at North for a lunch that surpassed my expectations.

494,"I really hope this is not what China tastes like  There are corporate chains that have better food and THEY are horrible   You can tell the ingredients are of the lowest quality and cost the owner the absolute least amount  Plain and simple just another ""don't care about quality"" place in a busy strip mall."
4183,Like the others below I ordered flowers through FTD and unfortunately the order was farmed out to Exclusive Flowers & Gifts It's pretty embarrassing when your CLIENT has to call you and thank you for the TERRIBLE DEAD MURKY ROTTING flowers that you sent to her in remembrance of her late father What makes matters worse is that when I requested a redelivery I was given attitude they insisted the original order be returned (because that's exactly what you want to do - inconvenience the RECEIVER of the gift to have to do something) and then the second batch was even worse than the first I'll never order FTD again and I highly recommend you avoid this shop it should be called EXCLUSIVELY CRAP FLOWERS & GIFTS.
3995,I had a very upsetting experience with Tony there  I negotiated with him for an iron table with a glass top and showed a high level of interest  He agreed on his price he suddenly said that I would have to buy the glass separately  This is crazy - why would somebody buy the glass separately if that is what the surface is already made out of  Shady approach to doing business and poor customer service  Getting nicer quality and better customer service at AZ Iron Furniture.
274,I have been dining at Serrano's for years  I rarely change my order which is chicken burro enchilada style (red) rice only  They offer complimentary chips salasa and hot BEAN DIP  Its worth it alone to have the bean dip never had it better anywhere else  Luckily Serrano's is all over the valley and if you're in a neighborhood for a period of time you can count on Serrano's offering you their amazing dishes.
1565,I Love Downtown Phoenix Why Well it's has lots to offer from Mexican food to Italian food The shopping is great (I love the modern bohemian charming Charlie and JoS Bank) the recently opened hotel palomar was also a great added bonus with a pool and bar And soon there will be apartments built next to the palomar hotel Can't wait.
2623,Always a long wait but the food is worth it  Their bacon is the best.
3996,What a disappointment I went here because of all the great reviews but maybe I went on the wrong day The greeter was kind no up-sell cashier was kind as well Problem is I came here to get my car washed as well Windshield left full of bugs rear seats not vacuumed rear windows had smudges and cup holders left full of crumbs Really No attention to detail or pride in the job they do.
964,"I had the exact opposite experience I spoke to Gilberto on the phone and everything seemed pleasant enough we set up a meeting for the following day so he could come and inspect the place and give me a price We'd been out of town for the summer visiting our parents as we do every summer as we are both teachers and don't work summers You can imagine our place was pretty messy but he overcharged me by about $100 dollars it usually cost but I let it slide as I read the last positive review here and wanted a cleanup job fast We agreed but he never showed up with the crew and when I called Gilberto back to find out what happened he hung up in my face These people are unprofessional throw out ""God bless you's"" to get you to think they're decent but you don't make commitments and then don't show and hang up on people Luckily Four Seasons landscaping was incredibly positive professional did a wonderful job and cost about 125 dollars less- and were incredibly polite (you can find them on Angie's List)."
3463,This restaurant is out of business I was really disappointed.
2685,Pizza & Hot Wings are EXCELLENT Great service & friendly staff Started going to this location because the one on Warner Ave & Gilbert Rd went to hell on the food & serviceworth driving the extra mile : ).
1697,Bookmans is the best  I cringe every time I have to buy a book anywhere else  The selection is huge the books are in great shape (and don't smell weird) and the prices are awesome.
4054,I really want to like this place but I suggest going somewhere else to eat Italian food in Goodyear like Dino's  My wife and I had eaten there several times and had so so service and food quality  We had a party for a friend where we invited people to come and eat and when everyone came (about 15 people) we ordered appetizers and then everyone ordered separately  When the time for the checks to come the server notified us that they were going to charge us $25 a persone  Some of the people and shared plates and no one ordered any alcohol  None of this was communicated to us prior to this event  We should have called the cops but we didn't this I regret  I have never even heard of a place doing something so idiotic  Our friend and I picked up the tab  So now I tell everyone to avoid this place  Oh and every time I ate there I go a case of diarrhea.
3588,Hostess is awkward and not friendly  We ordered jalape√±os on our burgers and instead of coming to tell us they were out she just put jabaneros on it and didn't say anything  A mouth full of fire later I ask wtf and she says oh yeah we substitute  Thanks for asking me   Additionally neither burger had the bacon we ordered on it Potato salad was good but served with plastic spoons Garlic fries were soggy Food was acceptable: I would try again Can't speak for the wings.
342,I love Sweet Tomatoes I can pig out on lots of good stuff here and with the ClubVeg coupons its very affordable.
4779,Shocker this place closed  This location was open for a long time and was great for a lot of it I don't know if owners changed or what but it went downhill fast The service got awful and the quality of the food got bad too I would be sad that this location closed but I had already quit going to this location months before they shut the doors.
4886,We have been here 3 times this year Like other reviewers we really want to make this restaurant a regular stop as we live around the corner We were in last Sunday morning for brunch with neighborhood friends Its always amazing that they are out of things that they should have ample stock This trip it was chorizo and diet coke  As usual the service is super friendly by the same waitress we have everytime Brunch menu was expensive and some of the items we ordered were not very good The waffles are served with whipped cream and whatever fruit topping you order They were extremely dry and should be served with some type of syrup Instead they make a point of telling you there is no syrup Some of the other items were very small portions and they couldn't have $ 200 in food cost but charge between 10-1400  As everyone in the restaurant is within 10' of the owner/chef you would expect some conversation from him Nothing The one thing he did do was to argue with a man and his family over an on line coupon Everytime we go there someone is questioning the charges or the discount entitled them from the coupon  Nice touch as we don't have one and are paying full price for poor food  One two three strikes your out.
1319,Sometimes you just want a good burger and fantastic service  Is that so much to ask  Burger a little pricey but so perfectly cookedThe service was so friendly attentive and helpful  It was my first time in the tempe/pheonix/scottsdale area and my server Jasmine was incredibly helpful in giving me ideas on what to doBrian the manager was fantastic in making sure we were well taken care of and everything was spot on  And their happy hour is fantastic  Home run and great first meal in AZ.
3984,Stopped by to try this place after work I waited to be greeted at the front for over 5 minutes  Finally a man (who I later learned was the owner) told me in a very abrasive tone to sit anywhere I want  Then a hostess came over and sat me near the back (I asked for a quiet table I began looking at the menu when the owner came back to me and told me that I could not sit there  He said it was too far for the waiters to walk to me  I laughed thinking he was kidding He continued to things like hurry up come on you are moving seats  He resat me near the bar and when on to harass another customer  I left before anyone else could talk to me  Crazy man.
2551,I parked in the Parking Garage got my parking ticket validated and still owed money for parking  The parking validation was worth $300  The charge for parking was $500 with $200 credit for the validation (not the $300 I was promised)  I paid the remaining $300 charge but then the machine wouldn't give me a receiptI am never going back to this location  It is off my radar from now on.
3231,Okay the Hot and Ready deal is a joke  They never have the $5 pizzas ready and there is always a wait  To top it off the last three times I have been there the clueless counter person has given away our pizza and bread to someone else making our supposed 10 minute wait closer to 20-25 minutes  While you can't beat the cheap price the service is seriously lacking.
3559,WARNING   This place has completely changed The only buffet they have now is the hot dog buffet with frys and drink that's it The all you can eat sandwiches are not included for any price You now have to pay for each individual sandwich Also the crab and prime rib is gone completely Of course before I came tonight I checked there website and nothing has changed there That is misleading as hell in my opinion This is my first time here and I won't be coming back The hot dogs are all cold and the buns are kinda hard Not good I will say the frys are very good and the guy behind the counter definitely felt bad about the changes The service has been excellent He gave me a free piece of chicken to try and make up for the changes     It was explained that they were bought out recently and the new owners were going to bring back some of the buffets but he didn't know which ones I recommend calling ahead before you come to find out.
2438,i have so many friends that love lush but had never tried them went to the store and was greeted immediately and not at all pressured i got exactly what i needed+ a sample of their hydratingg shampoo bar since i had mentioned that my hair was dry i abolutely love their stuff- i've been using it for almost a week and can already see the difference.
3248,"Where to begin I can't deny that the chef/owner is a reflective business man but to put it mildly he's lacking in customer service skillsI'd tried to get in to use a coupon I'd purchased for $25 dollars at least 3 times before I actually made it inAttempt one: ""We don't accept reservations this late"" (The coupon required a reservation) Attempt two: ""We're not open this late on Sundays"" (It was 7pm) Attempt three: ""We're not open doing construction on the patio""In each attempt mentioned above a man answered the phone and seemed to begrudge my attempts to patron his business with a tone in his voice and curtness in his replyThe final time I attempted to make a reservation a woman answered she was much more professional and customer-service oriented (Maybe she should be in charge of answering the phone Hint Hint)After arriving I was informed that my coupon had expired $25 wastedThe owner said he felt bad about it and gave us a few free drinks I was livid However I felt a little better after the pretentious European wine (very mediocre tasting) The salad was disappointing the cheese overpowered it I might have been happier with just a wedge of cheese on a plateThe friend a brought with me added chicken to his salad and got food poisoningI think I should be forgiven for the one-star review the rating is well deserved."
771,On my way to Yelp glory :) So I'm really starting to like this place  With the weather cooling off their patio is really cozy and they have a live acoustic band out there to set the mood  Really chill  Ambiance-So there is a more formal dining area in 1 part of the restaurant and then there is a dining area by the bar and some couches and chairs even for group gatherings  Then there's tables for dining outside  What can I say they have 3 cool areas depending on your crew and mood you are in  The bar has many chairs you can belly up to and the bartender that I encountered was so nice it caught me off guard Kudos to service there The decor is very much wine bar-centric and many cool pictures on the walls  A very relaxing setting  Cuisine-They offer 6 types of bruschetta as well as a variety of meats and cheeses with their antipasto selections  Great to pair with their extensive wine by the glass selections  Both I've had and they are amazing I can't speak to the entree's because if I'm trying different wines I'm  into more of pairing/small plate type of mood  Had the chop salad as an appetizer and that was delicious as well  Service-Right as you walk in the hostess is right there to greet you and ask you where you'd like to sit  As I stated above more of the formal dining area casual dining area bar or patio all open as options (if place isn't packed of course)  The wait staff and bartender are really personable and happy to address any questions regarding the wine or food  Service was very prompt as well  Overall I give this place the highest rating because all of the aforementioned criteria  If you feel likewise by all means check it out  Tell em Croft sent ya :).
2106,My  ex-hubby and I used to frequent this place in 1991 when it was called The Lone Star It was awesome thenand it's still just as awesomeI moved away for 20 years and when my ex-mother-in-law came into town we decided to give Texaz Grill a try not even thinking that it was the same place Boy Were we pleasantly surprisedNothing has changed Not the decorations not the menu not the friendly staff not the quality of the foodNOTHING Ok I'm lying There was a different picture on the back of the ladies room doorWe all ordered the Ribeye with the house salad/house dressing homemade mashed potatoes and cream gravy I've dreamt about those mashed potatoes The steaks were perfect Juicy tender flavorful cooked to order Chain steakhouses have NOTHING on this placeWe finished our meal with the homemade bread pudding with whiskey sauce Trust me you've never had bread pudding so good Full of cinnamon raisins and pecans with the most delightful whiskey sauceIf you live in Phoenix or are just passing through stop in at The Texaz Grill You won't regret it.
4997,This place is garbage First of all it was impossible to hear the employee through the speaker at the drive through Besides that I made a really simple order and even that was messed up Immediately noticed that part of the order was missing They took the bag of food from me to fix the order We sat there in the drive thru line for what seemed like ten minutes A six+ car line had formed behind me They finally came back to the window with another bag claiming that the issue had been fixed We did a quick check to see that we had the correct amount of food and it appeared to have been corrected When we got home we realized the order was wrong again/still and the breakfast sandwiches looked like someone sat on them They were extremely smashed The other part of my order was the coffee I asked for three coffee's Two regular one decafe The employee asked me if I wanted the coffee to be hot Yes of course I do He told me there was no hot coffee and that I would have to wait for a new brew To make a long story short the coffee was cold and watered down Avoid this location Horrible This was my first time ever going to this location and my last.
4677,I stopped by here recently around 9am and the donuts I got tasted like they were made a week ago Stale and old I thought they were supposed to make them fresh regularly I love Krispy Kreme donuts but this location seems to be run by a Dunkin' Donuts undercover spy hellbent on tainting the good name of Krispy KremeThis saddens me greatly.
928,"I feel sorry for Texans if they think THIS is good BBQ  Go to Joe's BBQ in GilbertWe were excited to try a new BBQ joint closer to our house since we normally go to Joe's BBQ in downtown Gilbert  Now listen fellow yelpers you have never steered me wrong  So I was convinced this was going to be good after reading all of the rave reviews and seeing a 4 start avg for this place  I cannot say that I agree with the good reviews of this place at allWe arrived at 5:45 PM on a Sunday eve and were cheerfully greeted by a young lady who helped us figure out how it worked  You grab a bottled beer or soda (or they have cups where you order for fountain drinks) and then order at the counter  No line and we got up to the counter and I decided on the moist brisket given the good reviews I had read on here  I watched them cut it up and throw it onto some wax paper and put it in our feeding trough (some crazy basket that they put all of your food into as there are no trays or plates)  I decided on beans and creamed corn and then the guy asked if I wanted white or wheat bread I chose white and he slapped 5 pieces of Wonder bread into the trough  I don't get the bread part and they give you way too much  Off we went with our basket of food and we found a picnic table to sit at where we didn't have to eat with strangers at one of the other long 20 person tables like on a cruise ship  We then checked out the condiments and I grabbed a paper container filled with pickles  Had both the sissy BBQ sauce and the hotter one and they both were ok  Nothing to write home about  The creamed corn looked and tasted like someone just took corn niblets from a can and put it into some cream  It was not tasty at all  The beans were not bad  But the moist brisketit was moist alright - it was oozing fat  I think 50% of the meat was fat  I was somewhat disgusted  My husband had the same thing and he did not like it either  Luckily he had chosen Lay's BBQ chips for his side Cannot go wrong there  Pretty sad when the best part of your meal is a bag of Lay's BBQ potato chips  I don't know what the big deal is about this place but I won't be back ""ya'all""."
2998,I know that this airport strives to be the friendliest Perhaps they need to share that philosophy with the people that work here Thankfully they have Blue Moon.
3053,We have been going to Mario and Ginger's place for some time and love it  It's a lot of Italy with a family atmosphere and the food is always perfect  We did a family event in their reserve room and the food and service was wonderful  The room has a projector for movies or special events  Going again tonight.
382,Pharmacy is the WORST  Waited in line for a flu shot  to be told to get in another line  After 15 minutes in the 2nd line we filled out some paper work and were given a beeper They said in 15-20 minutes when it goes off go up to the register  pay and get your shot  Ok after almost 1 hour at Costco later it goes off we go up to the pharmacy register with our little buzzer to be told to get back in line of over 20 people no thanks.
4424,"OhMyGodIt's been a loooooong time since I've been served food this bad before We ordered beef egg foo young honey garlic pork barbeque ribs and it came with white riceThe rice was good and was by far the highlight of our meal The beef egg foo young was some sort of high-density hockey puck (that was supposed to be the egg foo young) It had the texture of leather but didn't taste as good as leather It was slathered with a brown gravy that had pieces of beef but the beef was gristle-y and unappetizing The BBQ ribs looked very good but this was misleading One taste suggested this food had ""turned"" and we didn't eat any more for fear of getting sickThe honey garlic pork dish was tolerable It was small breaded pieces of pork in a sauce that tasted neither like honey nor like garlicThe white rice was good and sticky as white rice should beThe restaurant was clean to their credit including the bathroomI will NEVER go to this place again It's hard to believe a place this bad remains in business It wasn't even particularly well-priced."

3197,Lost orders no ice soda machine MIA miscounted change Pure chaos.
1404,It was a nice evening to go out to the Outback  Why not go and try out the new bar menu  Everything on the new menu was great  Between the cocktails and the apps  it was all awesome  So  the two flat-breads and the fried mushrooms were my favorite  Also the rum punch was my favorite drink  The other food they had were nachos and shrimp  It is always great to see friends that I know and meet new people at events  Thank you Lindsey and Outback for a wonderful evening out.
525,"Well the concept of this theater really appealed to me I still think the concept is great however thought in the execution seems to have been absentWe showed up at 9:20pm for a 9:45pm show We waited outside the ropes for about 10 minutes until we'd be allowed into our theater This gave a a few minutes to look around The theater is linked to both the Salt Lounge and Tanzy Restaurant with coordinated decor making for a very stunning and appealing sight with a comfy feel We had just came from dinner at Tanzy's (separate review) We ordered the Gold package and were told our server would take care of everything once inside the theaterOnce we were allowed to enter everyone entered the same door It wasn't until we were trapped in the line that we realized there was another door on the other side that would have sped up the wait to get into our seat Maybe if they were both open that might have streamlined seatingwe got to our seats got comfortable (more on that) experimented with the electric recliner and generally got situated Once our server showed we ordered My wife wanted a white wine The server highly recommended one of their Chardonnays We learned after tasting that 1) don't take wine recommendations from someone not old enough to drink and 2) iPic doesn't know a quality wine from vinegar The Chardonnay was easily the worst either one of us had tasted and we didn't finish it We ordered Chocolate covered strawberries and the Oreo Ice cream sandwich Our server didn't know they were out of the ice cream sandwich and told us when she delivered the strawberries Probably a good thing since that probably prevented another food abortion The chocolate covered strawberries were also horrible and unripe My bet is they're not made on premises but charge as if they were After just eating at Tanzy I wrongly assumed the menu would be similar since I believe they're owned by the same Menu was not greatat least the dessert menu with it's three options The other option was a Berries Sabayon which the server tried to push after our two previous dessert failures Not long into the movie my wife noticed her 3D glasses were dirty It took about 30 minutes before we saw our ""server"" again to ask for another pair The second pair was better but not much They reuse glasses and the high school kids working there probably aren't too into cleaning them wellComfort I was all set for a nice comfortable recliner Not There is a metal bar running across the middle of the back of the recliner that will be guaranteed to let you know it's there by the middle of the movie I spent the second half of the movie trying to avoid the bar to no success The only way I was able to minimize the bar in the back was with the foot rest down which kind of defeats the point of a recliner Since your feet won't touch the ground (and I'm 6'1"") that is an uncomfortable feeling as wellWhile the concept is fantastic the designers and operators really ignored the details If you build it they will come is not a good business model They may comeonce And once it will be We will not be back."
853,We recently went on a Friday night (the museum is free on Friday and Saturday nights right now)  The museum is very small but always has something interesting on display We especially enjoyed the Video Works exhibit  Always a great place to see some unusual art.
