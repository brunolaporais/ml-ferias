1570,1,We have been going here for about 3 years now  Everything from the food to the service is great every time  Our favorites are the orange beef sesame chicken generals chicken and their potstickers are amazing  The employees build a relationship with their customers and it's nice knowing we can walk into a restaurant and they know what we want and we know we'll be treated well.
3294,0,Dog Park Who are they kidding This place was crap and full of crap It looks as though people went in to this park just so their dogs could poop There were no clean up mitts and it was small and stinkyWhoever designed this dog park should be kicked in the balls No grass all gravel and the one water spigot That's right -  outside of the park Brainiack I wish I would have yelped this before I went What a waste.
1727,1,Loves me some Trader Joe'sOnly disappointment I have is their tortellini  Thank god I bought it for myself and not to make for companymore than half of it was garbage  Oh welleverything else here is great--including the staff.
3362,0,Given the option of being punched in the face and waiting in line at the Post Office I'd probably wait in line at the post officebut this particular location would make me give it a second thought  Inconveniently located slow as hell and ALWAYS full of people sending 20+ small packages to some random place overseas.
3204,0,Atrocious Consider the price point Dollar for dollar dining out just can't get any worse than this Grease laden obscenely over salted franchise food for twice the amount of money of your standard franchise restaurant  The service Poorly trained staff that has no idea what to do if a customer can't stomach the glop that just came out of the kitchen Why are bread plates on the table if you don't serve bread with the meal How on earth do you get off charging $750 for a short shot of Jack $625 for fake Guinness and $850 for diluted Citron This place offers nothing to get me back in there again It is awful and expensive Oh and one last suggestion to our server last night If any part of a dinner entree is categorically inedible take the WHOLE plate back to the kitchen and let the cook try to repair it Don't break up the dish onto those little unusable bread plates and don't return with the same crap that you left with.
4664,0,Can you give zero stars cuz that's all his place deserves Will not come back.
1241,1,You Have to try this place it simply amazing You won't get hard chunks of  ice like most snowballs These snowballs are powder soft and bursting with flavor Sweet cold and refreshing Jeff the owner is a super nice guy who is determined to find a flavor you will love There are 53 flavors to choose from and I plan on making my way through the list.
4354,0,"Bad food BAD serviceI ordered Cheeseburger Sliders and Tots The sliders were a joke and the tots tasted like they were fried in very old oil While I was chatting with my friends and waiting for the food our server came over and slammed my plate down in front of me which actually scared me and made me jump Later on I asked for hot sauce and when she brought it over she of course walked by quickly (without any eye contact) and also slammed it on the table Everything she said to us was lazy slurred and unclear On multiple occasions we would have to ask each other ""What did she say"" It was clear that she didn't want to be there There is no reason for that bad attitude especially since we did nothing that could have annoyed herTrust the negative reviews Don't go here."
3024,1,I did not stay here but I ate here for a Media Breakfast I attended with a professional society that I belong tooI won't comment too much because I know Hermosa Inn is indeed a hotel first but the banquet patio seating they gave us was simply outstanding It was a very gorgeous (and space heater supplied) space with a large center fountain and cafe style table and chairs complete with firepits and lounge seating spread out tooI absolutely loved the flower beds and large stretching trees planting about It was such a sight to see early in the morning The buffet style breakfast they servied was impressive too A large sampling of pastries mini jams muffins yogurt eggs potatoes bacon and sausage I mean we paid $15 each for it and it was well worth itWould go back here for a Sunday morning breakfast before a hike or something It was just so cute and quaint.
2999,1,Best cookies I've ever had I'm glad I don't live closer or my next review would be of the Biggest Loser ranch Awesome gelato too.
723,1,Always friendly clean & if there is a problem they will look into.
3111,0,I can't seem to understand 'why' many people rate this as a first-class sports bar because in actuality its one of the worst I've ever been in and I grew up going to the sports books in Juarez Mexico where their idea of a flat screen was a gabacho thumping the TV onto the sticky tile floor and looking cross at an hombre could get your eye cut out and fed to you as the special of the dayYes Majerle's is worse  Okay well no one in Thunder Dan's is gonna devour your soul but the place makes me feel like I'm sharing a pint with Florentines Catello di Rosso Gianfigliazzi and Ciappo Ubriachi in Dante's inner ring of the seventh circle of HellThe set up is terrible  The TVs are difficult to see from EVERYWHERE in the bar and they have it arranged so that if you are fortunate enough to view up to TWO SCREENS () at one time they are both showing the same game  This is a problem during major events like the NCAA tournament or bowl games  Moreover i would be kitten-hearted to ask a manager to change their programming to another game i'd rather watch  The bar is always crowded which makes it even more wondrous for me when i actually go in there and wait for a seat just to encounter no beer specials and terrible foodI wonder how large the bowl of crack the editors at Sports Illustrated were smoking to rate this anywhere near the top 1000 sports bars in the US.
3217,0,"I am forced to give this ""company"" one star but if I could I would do ZERO The person we have dealt with for nearly a year (Genette Edwards) has been lying to us since before we moved inMy husband and I chose a nice house in a gated Gilbert community to lease until we were sure we wanted to buy here now we wish we hadn't We are paying an exorbitant amount of rent for supposed all inclusive (its in our lease) landscaping and pool service (read my review for Poolman) They picked the crappiest companies they could find for this We are paying roughly $300 a month over market value for this rental and they are pocketing over $200 of that Poolman is worthless and the no name non-english speaking landscapers only show up once a month to raze the lawn to the roots or farther We have the worst looking yard in this neighborhoodThis woman told us she had had the locks changed before we moved in While my husband was out of town a few weeks ago and I was here alone someone broke into this house USING A KEY I had a locksmith who's been in the business for over 20 years come out and he told me the locks on this place (which has been a rental for years) have NEVER been changed They were the contractors master locks from when the house was BUILT in 2001 She then had the nerve to tell me the LOCKSMITH was lying to meAt this point they have violated our lease no less than 12 times in the last 9 months On the up side we never have to deal with them again once we moveHORRIBLE COMPANY DON'T RENT FROM THEM."
4178,0,"Have you ever had a florist call the person whom you've ordered flowers for to see if she was homeI love getting flowers  Especially when I am not told that I am getting them  Having the doorbell ring and instead of a salesman or a Jehovah witness there is a delivery driver with a beautiful bouquet of flowers makes me very happyApparently I am getting flowers today for my birthday  How do I know this  Because A Bloom Of Inspiration Florist called me at 2:15 pm to find out what my daily schedule is like and what time I will be leaving the address that was given by the person who lovingly ordered the flowers to be delivered to me  ""Umm I am a stay at home mom  I will be here all day but thanks for ruining the surprise""  On a side note:  There was a time frame of 10am-6pm given when the flowers were ordered  So at 5 pm when the flowers still haven't been delivered  I call and the owner gives me a hard time because they are 20 miles away and delivery was inconvenient  The flowers were ordered from 1-800-Flowers  It was 1-800-Flowers who contracted thru this florist to deliver flowers to an address 20 miles away  I have no idea why they felt the need to address this issue with their customer  This should have been taken up with the company they're contracted with  BTW: This florists website says ""Our delivery areas are GILBERT CHANDLER SUN LAKES MESA TEMPE SCOTTSDALE QUEEN CREEK"" I live in south Scottsdale on the southeast border of Tempe and Mesa  It is after 6:00 pm and the flowers still have not been delivered  The hours of this florist listed on yelp is Mon-Fri til 6pm  So at this point I have no idea if my flowers will even be delivered today  Bottom line:  This florist is unprofessional ruined the surprise delivered very late in the day (or maybe not at all) complained to their customers and didn't provide the service as agreed upon____________________________________________________________Update:  The flowers were delivered at 6:25pm and I was told by the driver/apparent owner (again) how inconvenient the delivery was and how she had to close the store and drive the 20 miles to deliver  The flowers are cute but are not nearly as nice as the picture on 1-800-flowers describes them  I included both pictures above  My family member who ordered the flowers was very disappointed and will never use 1-800-flowers again  Although 1-800-flowers appologized for the issues that we had they were unwilling and unable to take responsibility for their contracted florists mistakes  My family member learned her lesson  If you want to order flowers for someone you love yelp a local florist in the recipients neighborhood that has good reviews and call them directly."
3582,0,Don't be fooled by their 50% coupon I went in for highlights and walked out paying $72 (after the 50% discount) When I asked why it was so expensive after the discount was applied I was told it only discounted one service I was confused since I only got one service (highlights) but was told  hey charge $20 for a blowdry and $10 for a toner What kind of salon charges an extra $20 for a blow dry Shouldn't that come standard with all services My hair only goes a little past my shoulders and everytime I have ever got highlights the most I have paid was $75 at FULL price I went in thinking I'd end up paying 40 for highlights with my coupon This place charges way too much for their services No wonder I was one of 2 women there on a Saturday when most salons are usually jam packed.
1614,1,Phoenix is big but so is the reward you'll earn by getting across it to My Mother's You'll enter a homey-decorated time machine back to when food and drink were generous and scrumptious and service was authentic and personable In the latter function look for Teresa who presented our chicken-themed dinner entrees --- chicken tenders chicken-fried steak and chicken-fried chicken --- with ample sassy conversation And how about that fresh-most salad bar and the potent margaritas We were lucky enough to catch Mother herself on a rare visit from her place of retirement but once you've visited the place your return visits won't be rare at all.
2935,1,You've got to get the guacamole & pork shoulder  Cool atmosphere and great foodwe loved this place Service could've been a bit quicker but the quality of the food made up for it.
1671,1,I am no expert on Korean food and I will never be Oxknee soup How does one eat an animal's knee HuhWhatever What I had was wonderful I had beef in very hot boiling broth with cabbage and carrots Also had pork which was more flavorful than I was expectingThere's several items on the menu that was completely alien to me so I cannot vouch for the more exotic items they offer But if you like Korean and/or want to try something new (and really good) then check this place out.
499,1,We are staying downtown and had decided to go to Sunday Mass in St Mary's Basilica one of the oldest churches in Phoenix  From the outside it's an mission style stucco exterior while inside all the alters are adorned with statues of the saints and the pipe organ in the upper balcony is absolutely wonderful to hear  Mass was very old school in that it was sung from start to finish  It lasted 1 hour and 45 minutes  Considering the Church is downtown there were a large congregation present and not everyone looked like a tourist  It's a beautiful old Church worth taking a look at.
244,1,Love this store Clean store and has a large selection I hit it during the liter sales so I got real good prices.
4060,0,Let me explain the 1 star I've been to Scott's a few times before  LOVED IT I've sat outside ordered to go but never have I sat inside until last weekWas visiting with friends and we got a booth placed our orders  started to chit-chat and out of the corner of my eye I see something on the wall No Couldn't be Why yes it was your friendly neighborhood roach And he brought a friend We gals stopped talking midstream looking around to see if anyone else saw what we did Why yes our server saw the two unwelcome guests as she was standing at the food delivery window Guess what she did Nothing Until we pointed them out and rapidly moved to another tableHonestly we all were wigged out Talk about an appetite lost Too bad I had totally enjoyed Scott's up until then Most likely will not be back.
2052,1,Perfect place for a staycationTo be fair I chose Hyatt Gainey as my top choice for my bachelorette weekend primarily because of their spa (see my review for Spa Avania)  While I'd been to Hyatt Gainey years ago (before their renovation) I had never really spent time at this hotel nor had I stayed there before  So needless to say I was in for a treat  And so were my friends that came to spend the weekend with meThe service at Hyatt Gainey was top notch from the bell men to the reception the barista at the coffee stand the servers in the restaurant  and at the pool and of course at the spa  The room we stayed in was spacious and perfect for our group  We had four girls on Friday and planned for five on Saturday I  know you're thinking that there's no way that many girls could share one bathroom and you're right - we used the spa to shower and get ready instead of the roomWith all of our festivities we ended up not being able to see the live music that everyone raves about nor did we get a gondola ride  More reason to return for another staycation spa day or just a visit for drinks sometime soon.
1209,1,Hey - All the local construction guys eat here - so you he has good quality stuff at low pricesNice assortment of different Hot dogs.
1734,1,Always delicious and always there when I need it Here is another place that I am a creature of habit Side by side salad no pico and extra salsaFresh and tasty  The side by side salad isn't on the menu but they are always ready to make the exception and create my favorite meal  Lettuce mexican cheese sliced avocado grilled chicken drizzled with their green tomatillo salsa  Of course I make a visit to their salsa bar and add some hot red salsa lots of cilantro and a few squeezes of fresh lime  Ahhhhhh Baja FreshI Love you.
4182,0,No DD here  It's gone  I apparently can't find an actual DD near ASU.
1494,1,They do a great job  Staff is prompt friendly and helpful  I can get in touch whenever I need to - and it's all backed by a big-name company  I've know Tom for a long time and he is very knowledgeable when it comes to insurance matters.
2196,1,Amazing food and service  Went here with some of my guy friends and got our food fairly fast  I ordered the burger and loved it amazing chabatta like bread and unique but satisfying taste.
4039,0,To start with I tried 'Idli' (with Chutney and Sambar) The Idli was way off course and actually didnt taste like one The chutney probably had 10% coconut (as compared to 100% coconut that I have come across many Udupi Cafe's across US) and the Sambharabsolutely pathetic Moving to main course all the curries were highly reduced and were not that delectable I am keeping this review short and sweet because you cant write much about how pathetic food was for the price that I paid I am never going back to this place any time in my life.
3583,0,Oh my God Whoever the people are that are giving this place good reviews must be used to eating poop covered dog food Worst tacos I've ever had salad bar seemed like it was set out sometime in the 1970's pretty sure the mashed potatoes were soaked in urine instead of butter and the marinara sauce was cooked in a boot instead of a pot Couldn't wait to get out of there and go brush my teeth GOOD BYE RUBY TUESDAY.
1279,1,Owners are amazing All of their staff is friendly and very helpful They offer High-Quality products that do NOT fall apart after the first washing Very hip clothing that the owners hand pick Impressive Expensive Yes but quality usually is Thanks 42 Saint keep up the good work.
3787,0,They make their pancakes with peanut oilWhich makes me sad because I'm allergic to peanutsSo yeah until they use something else I literally can't eat pancakes here.
4479,0,Tried to eat here Finally ordered after 10 min in a line that barely moved and waited for about 35 min before we asked where our order was They couldn't even find it anywhere It wasn't on the screen or being madenothing Well considering I had other things to do I had to leave Won't be back.
2307,1,Can you say SPORTS MEMORABILIA But I have to say the food stands on its own I had trout my husband baby back ribs  Attentive service Festive energy Families couples golf foursomes Wander and enjoy celebrity photos autographed baseballs and bats.
404,1,Inta Juice is awesome The owners are friendly and consistently deliver a quality product Love my Sunshine Passion on a hot summer day.
4541,0,I read below that this restaurant is a great place to take your mom out for breakfast so hey I listened and decided it'd be worth a try My mom and I headed out Sunday morning to grab a nice meal and catch up Well unless your idea of bringing mom out to breakfast is causing her to have an aneurysm then this isn't the place for you Look I'm patient but when I walked into a restaurant and try to simply put my name on the waitlist and get shoved aside by other patrons that's strike 1 When the manager and his five unhelpful staff of chickens run around like their heads are cut off that also worries me Does it really take 6 people to man the front of the restaurant -- and by man I mean disregard customers Glad I walked out before being sat down because I'm sure the kitchen is in as much disarray as the entrance.
290,1,Giant Coffee is the newest venture from the creative genius who brought us Matt's Big Breakfast and Roosevelt Similar to these other hot spots Giant Coffee is ultra hip and doesn't disappoint While in town I met with a friend for an espresso and instantly fell in love with the space The coffee shop offers a modern and hip retreat from the cement jungle I am a sucker for ultra modern loft-like spaces so instantly I loved the vibe Giant offered While I was there they had the space opened up so we had the pleasure of enjoying fresh air while sipping the rich dark coffeeThe coffee was delicious I am happy to find a non corporate chain coffeehouse in AZ The baristas were friendly hipsters so I felt right at home =)There is a $5 minimum if you use a card for payment But use a credit card so you can check out the Square technology on their iPadThis place is top notch and a welcomed addition to my future Phoenix visits.
2417,1,I kind of wish everyone else wasn't giving it 5 stars  Now I have a 30-40 minute wait every time I go  But it is worth it  The coffee is terrific and my new favorite Banana & Nutella crepes are to die for.
2563,1,Just as great at the first timeWe had the tofu lettuce wraps and the chicken terriyaki rice bowl  Everything was super good and they even gave me a refill on my Arnold Palmer to go.
1841,0,Not good at all  Two beer selections on tap and only one bottle of the beer I decided on in the entire place  The meal was fatty and not tender  We overheard a server mention that it was under new management but that was over a year ago  This place needs help.
4380,0,"Thai rama ding don't go hereThere are many better options and the $150 you save is just not worth the shortcomingsService was lax the spring roll was hard and cold the rice was dried out on top and the dish lacked spice and a good flavorIt was a Wednesday lunch a11:30 and this place was already packed which is usually a good sign  I went for the lunch special Mango Delight $650 ""hot"" of courseThe cabbage soup that is included came out but to my disappointment it has chicken in it not veg friendlyOur meals finally started to arrive (about 5 min apart) which is annoying as I like to eat when my food arrives but I also have manners  On the plate there was a small portion of fried tofu with veggies and grilled mango while the grilled mango was nice the rest of the items were lackluster As I stated the rice and spring roll both had issues and the wonton chips were not the freshest If you really want to add an odd element to you meal there is the spicy caddy that has Thai chilies in an extremely foul smelling liquid Thoughts of that smell alone still haunt meBottom line at $650 the lunch prices are good but the lack of quality and taste lead me to go elsewhere."
383,0,Came here for Christmas dinner with my mother Big mistake 7 o'clock and they were packed I couldn't believe it We waited 20 mins for a table (which we didn't mind we were in no rush) After getting our drinks we ordered some guacamole and chips as our appetizer We waited and waited finally like 20 minutes later watery guacamole (it looked like pea soup) and the WORST tortilla chips came out The chips were so stale we couldn't finish our one bite they were also soaked in grease We spit it out and told our waitress She brought us new chips that were not much better but edible We kept the soupy guac as we hated to complainthey were so busy we just blew that off I got the bruschetta chicken pasta but asked for shrimp instead of chicken I don't do dairy so asked for no cheese Waitress said no problem Mom got a ribeye steak and shrimp with sweet potato fries The food came after 35 minutes My pasta with extra cheese Ughand 4 of the rawest shrimp sitting on top Sent it back because I can't eat cheese Waitress brought a new one without cheese I like my shrimp well done or at least cooked to a healthy and safe temp She brought the new pasta it was ice cold Then she took back the shrimp and left the pasta So the cold pasta was left to get even colder while they fixed the shrimp Then when she brought the shrimp they had to microwave my dinner to get it hot againresulting in it being dryer than dry Ekkk Moms steak was served in a pool of butter and grease Literally She used all the napkins at the table to sop it all up Some of her fries were wet and mushy from the butter And the shrimp was missing from her plate After asking several times they finally brought it Nothing special Just shrimp We used a coupon buy one get on free They charged us 6$ for my four raw shrimp It was ridiculous Yes it was Christmas but really This experience should have been better Even for Christmas night I don't think we will be back.
2883,1,Love it Great coffee and service with a smile.
4022,0,It wasn't for me I generally like middle eastern food  I got the sampler to go  babaganesh falafel taheni humus with pita Everything was very bland The pita and falafel were chewy I ended up throwing most of it out.
605,1,Very nice people where warm and you had a welcome feeling  The Paster is young and very nice.
418,1,I've only had the meatball sub and the italian sub but both of them knock the socks off the competition  If you've never been here you should just go and experience it for yourself.
4930,0,We went there last night had an almond joy milkshake which tasted terrible we shared a half size and couldn't even drink it The burger was ok in n out makes a better burger for a lot cheaper.
449,1,The bestperiod  Car Cleaners always does a fantastic job on my vehicles  Every service I have had performed on my vehicles has been top notch  This is the type of local business that is so easy to support they are awesome.
768,1,Some of the best Italian I've ever had It was pleasantly surprise The place doesn't look that great from the outside but the food makes up for it The martini's were expensive and not that great Pasta is made right at the restaurant Highly recommend getting some pasta Staff was friendly.
2088,1,Good price and big facilityno sales pressure just good workouts.
2178,1,I came her the other day with Abu J for a little stroll  It is peaceful and charmingly quirky all at the same time  Lot's of little paths to stroll on and whimsical architecture to take in  We will definitely be back for a bell soon.
4652,0,Rude management and office staff very slow response times from maintenance team (if they came at all) and ridiculous charges at move-out Thankfully I was able to talk them out of the extra charges since they were based on nonsense The complete lack of help from the office staff leaky roof frequently shut-off water and bad termite problem made living here a total hassle The only redeeming quality was the lovely Gainey neighborhood and close proximity to the Hayden Greenbelt No thanks never again and I don't suggest you rent there either.
1131,1,"This is my spot for a business meeting in North Phoenix I have also taken my family here a few times for our normal Sunday lunchThe place is really decorated nicely not ""over the top"" cheap Japanese stuff conservative and very nicely done Casual and comfortable The service and staff are awesome The variety of the rolls are awesome Want something you don't see The chef's will make it for you They know almost all the various names and ingredients of most rollsPrices are really good One catch - they serve canned soda (as of 742012) so refills are not free No biggie for me but someone reading this may careNOTE: I use this place all the time for business meetings Since I am normally there for 2+ hours I make it worth the wait staffs time and tip appropriately While we have never spoken about it they know that I will cut the meeting short pack up and leave if I see the place filling up (have done it a few times) I think this is common courtesy and wish more ""mobile-office"" people would do the same."
1735,1,I've been here many times Today they had a new menu I like seafood so I get a pasta bowl I tasted it and the noodles were chewy I mentioned it to the waiter and he spoke with a manager Manager came right over and explained that it was a new noodle with a very different texture He understood  I wanted a more usual soft noodle and replaced my meal without hesitation And that he would remind wait staff to mention the new noodle difference The replacement was great So kudos to great service and understanding  They also do still have the make your own bowl which I might stick with next time :).
1468,1,*Excellent variety * super clean store * well stocked * friendly people * Worth the trip     I had to find a party store and was at Banner Estrella Hospital  This Party City location came up in a search on my phone  I am not familiar with that part of town but easily found it   I was so pleased with how friendly and helpful everyone in the store was as soon as I walked in   They had a huge selection of themed party goods including candies that matched   Aisles and aisles of neatly stocked party goods gave me great ideas for both work related events and personal parties and entertaining   The manager Ed was the nicest guy and we chatted quite a bit   I read other reviews and don't know what they are talking about because this fantastic   I am very familiar with Party City and this was the most well stocked with huge variety and cleanest store I have seen   Prices are good - certainly no more expensive than other party stores While I was there 2 people came in for returns and they were handled without any problem  I heard the transactions - so I have no idea why someone said they didnt take returns    I will go out of my way to shop here even though it is quite far from my home   Thanks And I cant wait to visit at Halloween.
701,1,Great place for a casual dinning experience Good food at a good price and close to home My daughter loves it because sometimes someone makes her a balloon animalThis is family run restaurant a real testament to the American dream that sometimes the average guy (family) can make good.
2749,1,Cinnamon Carmel Buns are one of my favorite things to eat in the valley  Love getting them at the Tammie Coe booth at Vincents on Saturday  I regular get the english muffins for breakfast and cupcakes for special occasions at home.
4107,0,As with any landlord read the fine print Make sure you document and understand what fees they can charge you at their sole discretion If you dispute what they charge they will not listen and simply submit it to a debt collection agency Photograph and document everything upon move in They make considerable money soaking tenants upon move out I personally would find a more scrupulous landlord.
385,1,"""Ordinary food done extraordinarily well"" or something like that is their motto and you can take that to the bankJoe's Farm Grill is pretty inconveniently located for me (I am in north Phoenix Joe's is in southeast Gilbert) but every so oftenit's worth the tripJoe's angle is that it literally is a farm and much of what they serve is apparently raised on that farm This translates into basic diner faire of outstanding qualityTheir burgers and fries are out of this world and their onion rings are possibly the best I have ever had Homemade cheesecake lemonade pizza all kinds of things on their menu that you would see anywhere but much better than everywhere elseThe location is very clean and if the weather is nice their outdoor seating is gorgeous Even their bathrooms are something to admire (you'll see what I mean)I don't get out in that area much but when I do I always try to get out to Joe's Highly recommended."
1216,1,This place is awesome Dr Kessler and his staff do a phenomenal job I just found this place recently and will continue to make the drive to Scottsdale for all my eye care needs My only gripe is that the selection of frames is on the short end but I still found something I liked.
1700,1,Best place ever The product is amazing and the is friendly knowledgable and made me feel welcome.
2608,1,Nates barber shop is one of the best shops that I have encountered in my life If your looking for a great inexpensive ($13) good looking haircut this is your place The father & son are both great professional & customer friendly barbers I highly recommend this place to anyone.
4594,0,"Loves I'm the sushi chef at home and I make fresher and tastier sushi than a restaurant up the road from me The sushi rice was tough and hard not steamy and fresh out of the rice cooker like it was just sitting there for hours y'know The fish did not taste fresh to me and I always make my sushi fresh at home My step-father even looked up at me as we where eating and said ""I'm spoiled at home really I am"" I laughed but silently agreed with him The Price: Ridiculous Period Who wants to pay $65 for sushi that tastes bad when I could have made the same amount for around $10 and it taste terrific Never again The only thing I like about the place is the amazing waiter she's friendly and does so much work that I really appreciate her  You go girl."
1401,1,The owner is very nice and the gelato is the best in the valley We go on a regular basis and love it.
592,1,This is one of Scottsdale's treasures  The concept is refreshing - they incorporate fresh local ingredients as best as they can This means that there are seasonal changes to the menu but that only gives you a reason to go backI like to order dishes when I go out that I've never had before  You'll find a number of odd sounding dishes here but don't be afraid to be adventurous Who knew that I'd like braised leeks with mozzarella and a fried egg But I do  I doubt that you'd be disappointed in any of the appetizers but in addition to the leeks try the pork and duck pateAt one time or another I think I've tried all of the main courses - pick whatever tickles your fancy - I don't think you can go wrong  Save room for dessert A personal favorite is the butterscotch puddingYou'll also find an interesting wine list here - I believe they are all from Arizona wineries - Who knew  They're surprisingly goodOne tip - This is a popular place so you should make a reservation.
2987,1,This is absolutely hands down the best frozen yogurt shop I have ever been to  New York Cheesecake = Amazing Chocolate = Delicious Cake Batter = Phenomenal  And to top it off - they have the best toppings  Cinanamon toast crunch cheesecake twix crunched up sugar cone hot fudge and 50 other toppings  I usually go to Orange Leaf - but this is way better.

4976,0,I saw a coupon online for $50 off so I called to get a quote on replacing my brake pads I told him the make and model of my car which is a fairly common non-luxury vehicle He said he wouldn't know the cost until he saw it and I had to bring it in He said it could be from $100 to $1000 but he wouldn't know until he did an inspection.
4852,0,"Unlike the previous reviewer I dont think my attitude had anything to do with my bad experience   I think it had more to do with half (of the already skimpy menu) being sold out by the time we were finally seated  During our 3 hour wait (which we planned for) one of our group of six had to walk back to the car (parked almost a mile away due to there being no where else to park) to get their medication  Of course we were called to the table when they were 2 blocks away and even though we had 5 out of 6 people and swore the last was walking here that very moment they said we would have to wait  Less than 2 minutes later the last person arrived and we let the hostess know and then waited another 45 minutes and watched her seat 4 other tables before us as if to show us just who was running the show around here  We pretty much had to order what was left on the menu after playing the ""we're out of that"" game with the waiter 4X and when the food finally did come I was hungry enough to think play-doh spaghetti was a delicacy  It wasn't particularly bad  The ingredients were fresh enough but it just wasn't nearly anything special enough to warrant the hassle  I'm only reviewing this place tonight because I just came from Christopher's and had a pizza that puts this place to shame for about the same price and a fraction of the snobbery."
4271,0,The worst business service you could possibly get I am going to complain to Groupon for offering such a bad buy This person booked my appointment then on arriving at address I was told she had moved After a lot of asking I was given the intersection of her new address Arrived there couldn't find it Someone else looked up and got the new address for me I put it into the GPS and arrived but there was no such place I phoned many times but she wouldn't pick up Beware It seems like a scam.
571,1,It's an interesting mix of opinions posted about Chino Bandito Frankly on my first visit I wasn't sure what to think On my next visit I was hooked  Whenever I find myself near the 17 and Greenway I'm thinking about stopping by for eat-in or take-outChino Bandido is definitely a funky place as everyone says It's in a not so fancy strip mall with not so fancy decor inside But look past it and you'll have some fun Even though it's kind of funky I did find it to be clean - and I'm extremely finicky about cleanlinessSome of the menu winners include the

779,1,As a vegetarian with a fairly adventurous palate I love Ethiopian food And now that I work in northern Tempe I'm here all the time It's filling flavorful and inexpensive I can have a pretty big dinner for less than $10 If you like me think spiced (though not particularly spicy) vegetables are the greatest things on Earth definitely pay a visit to Blue Nile.
4564,0,Unsanitary  I wish I would have read the previous reviews (cockroach etc) as that would have saved us from one of the worst food experiences I've had in a long long time  We ordered a chicken panini (in which they got it wrong and used ham) a soup which was so salty that it was inedible and finally a salad which came complete with a long blonde hair of one of the workers (we both have black hair) After showing the hair the only response I got was a refund of just the salad  Please avoid this as there are much better options in Desert Ridge  Even paradise bakery is a much better option.

4507,0,I came into town for a show and was excited to try a gluten free friendly restaurant I could have not been more disappointed Since I notice most reviews of this place are very positive and extremely long I'll try to be direct and to the point Service was incredibly slow We waited a long time for food and to pay our bill I noticed everyone waiting a long time for their food and when stuff came out it was in odd bursts Atmosphere was some what pretentious and for the food I ate not at all warrantedFood was uninteresting and mediocre I ordered the grass fed burger medium rare on a gluten free bun The burger was preformed and nowhere near medium rare  They way this place markets itself I was expecting something fresh and well prepared Instead I got something I'm pretty sure had been frozen in the shape in which it was cooked and brought to me I wouldn't be surprised if the whole meal was cooked in a microwave The bun was gluten free bread which is okay someplace that doesn't use the word bun on their menu My friend's pizza we also compared to frozen pizza cooked in a microwaveI love food and have eaten at amazing gluten free and other health conscious restaurants  in many cities so I think I can be a good judge This place failed for me in every possible way except in cleanliness But if you told me they were cooking frozen food in a microwave in the apartment next door and then bringing it over I wouldn't be the least surprised.
4181,0,Met a friend for dinner and drinks Ambiance is wonderful Good drinks Absolutely horrible food that was very expensive adding insult to injury I ordered the halibut The portion was thin and about the size of the palm of my petite hand and very salty and dry There was a very small serving of veggies The cost of the dinner was $2800  My friend got the Lobster Pasta A very small overcooked serving for $2500Terribly disappointing Would only return for HH.
2988,1,As they promised it was less than 8 minutes through the line and believe me I was timing it from the start I mean it is the first thing you see as you walk in to the store Great location and they do deliver from 11am to 2pm which will now be well utilized going forward The store however is very clean and warmly decorated and it pulls me to come back again I had the Italian which is one of their signatures and for good reason I am a man of simple taste but a strict eye for detail The sandwich was amazing to say the least The help was knowledgable and very friendly I could keep writing everything I enjoyed but I think I have given you enough to try for yourself Who knows you might even run into me if you do.

3691,0,This place just has bad food  I've been there twice and been disappointed both times  All I remember from the first time was the shockingly horrible rice and beans  How does a Mexican restaurant not make good beans and rice  The beans were bland and the rice was old and hard and like the beans had no flavorThe second time I had a chile relleno it's supposed to be an egg based batter around the chile  This was just egg  It was like a chile inside an omlette  Which although not like mom used to make should taste good too but it was just swimming in oilThis place had a ownership change a few years ago and I am certain this place is just living off of it's old reputation  There are a few people who grew up with this place and they continue to recommend it  Oh and don't go to the place next door either Tony's sucks too.

841,0,My daughter signed a contract with Atlasta to do her wedding  They couldn't deliver on the things that they promised so they just canceled the contract  I heard some of their experienced staff have left the company and we were dealing with inexperienced people who have no concept of what a wedding should be  We wasted 5 months working with them and lost our deposit on the banquet hall  I heard from friends in the industry that this used to be a great catering company but is now going downhill  I'd be very careful dealing with Atlasta  If you want pain and anxiety you've got it  There are a lot of very good caterers and resorts who are just as good or better and so much easier to work with.

2190,0,Came here for lunch on a weekday  No karaoke was going on so there was NO REASON to come here  The service was absolutely terrible  We spent over 90 minutes most of it waiting for service the bill and for the waitress to pick up the bill  I gave up on using a credit card and used cash instead so we could get out of there  I had a bowl of chili my wife had a salad and Mom had soup and a wrap  Although the food was not terrible it was nothing special and combined with the lousy service we were very disappointed  UNLESS YOU WANT TO DO KARAOKE AT NIGHT DO NOT EAT HERE.
1155,1,Best craft beer joint in Phoenix No one else is brewing beer as imaginative as this The 4 Leaf Irish Red is surprisingly refreshing I loved the Dark Knight Porter - and not just because of the Batman reference But it was the seasonals that blew me away - especially the black IPA (And who else in Phoenix is brewing a Cascadian dark ale by the way) The food options are limited but it is a working brewery after all Bottom line: If you wanna taste some truly great beer this is the place to go.
4654,0,Now that I no longer have to deal with this place I can finally write a review  The day I stepped in I just came here to get a prescription so I could order blue contacts  Nationwide Vision was the first place on the list of places my insurance worked with so I naturally thought first meant best  Boy was I wrong  First of all they have you change out your contacts in the bathroom (gross)  Not only is that disgusting but also highly unsanitary  Second when I went in for my exam the doctor tried to convince me I had all these things wrong with my eyes that I didn't  He pretty much scammed me into believing I had to wear glasses for a while and then come back and get a prescription  So now I had to buy a $200 pair of glasses on top of contacts (Oh and a $40 fitting fee)  When I came back I had the SAME RESULTS on the test (because there was nothing wrong the whole time)  I also got hit with the news that they had ordered the wrong prescription for my left eye and that I would have to be coming back yet again once they were in  Granted the company did realize this was their mistake and covered the second box of contacts it is still ridiculous and time-consuming  I am so happy I never have to work with these people again  I will be promptly going back to my old eye doctor  She isn't covered by my insurance but is still WAY cheaper than a trip to these incompetent morons.
987,1,I have been utilizing MTO Cleaning for a few years now and am ALWAYS satisfied with the service  Judy the owner is fantastic and is always willing to work me in if I need a cleaning last minute  I also really like that she prices homes by sq ft - they don't have to come out to do an estimate like many other services do  They will come as often as you like and you will be VERY happy you spent the money - and I think it's EXTREMELY affordable.
3011,1,Well well I might as well do the honors and keep the 5 star trend : )I work nearby but I had not noticed this place My friend recommended it for lunch an I was not quite sure of the conceptHowever the staff was super friendly the ingredients look great the pizza was very tasty and to top it off the flavored unsweetened tea was awesome as well ( They had Black tea passionfruit and jasmine/blackberry tea)The pizza crust was very thin and crispy and it cooks really fast The setup us modern the music is upbeat and the prices are very reasonable Daughter had a steak salad and the portion was big and the said it was very tasty My friend had the Hawaiian hubby had the Italian meats or something like that and I went crazy with a custom one Garlic oil little alfredo and little tomato sauce Mozzarela chees and a little feta and little parmesan Pepperoni and Capicola (I didn't even know what capicola was) artichoke mushroom jalapeños red onions black olives and kalamata olivesWe will definitely be back Oh I do not know if they have it but if they don't the only thing that would make this place better is if they have wheat crust.
2068,1,What a gem of a place in old town Scottsdale Has it all from ambiance to service They use as many local products as possible great bruch sparkling wine selections Prices are great and portions spot on This place is must try I will be going there again.
3031,1,Pho Ao Sen is one of the rare Asian restaurants who truly get it--that what draws people is not only having fantastic food (which they do) but also creating the *right environment*  With trickles of water strings of jazz and a comfortably lit and set-up interior it serves basic Vietnamese fare at the basic Vietnamese fare that we have come to expect and love  It's not pretentious by any means but comfortable and welcoming  The food is filling delicious and definitely satisfying.

2093,1,I love this place I've taken everyone I know and love here And no complaints from anyone so far My Anglo friends like the food and so does mi familia  Most people who are only famliar with Americanized Mexican food will not understand what is going on here And those haters out there that think Mexican cuisine cannot be a fine dining experience you can keep your 2 for 1 tacos made from questionable meat sources If you'v visited different regions in Mexico besides Baja Rocky Point and Cancun you'll appreciate the regional dishes at this restaurant and the inventive use of ingredients and crazy flavors The Chiles en Nogada and the Pato en Tamarindo are my favs And with over 200 tequilas to taste I look forward to tryng something new every visit.
894,0,Wow  This could possibly be the worst experience I've ever had at a restaurant  First they seated us in a back room that had a completely different ambience from the main dining room this was like a bad addition with high-watt fluourescent spotlights and rickety tables crammed into the corners surrounding a party of ~20  The worst part however was the insanely loud party of Scottsdale douchebags that were having some sort of party in the room  The staff acted like they didn't even notice and made no attempt to quiet them I'm talking slamming on tables screaming across the room at one another and just general douchebaggery  The food was mediocre the appetizers were cold and my pork chop was certainly nothing special  Do yourself a favor and spend your money somewhere else.
1819,1,On my last trip to Arizona I noticed there was a Grimaldi's in the area  Of course I was doing very important research and had to check it out to see if was up to par with the one in Vegas  The service was friendly and very accommodating  Our waitress was very attentive and prompt with our every request  Refills were abundant and as usual the pizza was amazingI ordered my favorite combination:  Italian sausage ricotta cheese and fresh basil (after cooking)  The pizza was every bit as good as I remembered it in Vegas  There was nothing missing not even a hint of imperfection  Damn I love this pizza  Sure it's a bit pricey  But to me you just can't put a price on delicious pizza  Grimaldi's has pizza down to a scienceThe waitress also hinted that a California location was a possibility  I sure hope so  CA people are missing out.
2634,0,I will drive across town to go to other Trader Joe's so that I do not have to go to this location again The non refrigerated produce is mostly organic I think it is great that TJ's offers so many organic options but I personally choose not to buy organic Hate me if you want to I don't care but if you are giving the option of choosing organic then I should have the option not too By not carrying a large selection of non organic vegetables I am forced to buy them at a higher price mind you or doing without I noticed the same with the meat I understand that this location is space challenged but I do not appreciate having to purchase the more expensive product because management has made the decision not to carry the basics The second complaint I have is that they have a few register lanes but usually only 1 or 2 are open and they just let the lines build up without opening any more My third complaint is that the last time I was there I bought a reusable bag but not all of my groceries would fit in it so I had to use the paper bags I did not double bag them and I packed them full to the brim except for the last one The last bag had about 4 delicate items in it and the cashier an elderly woman with gray hair had the nerve to take them out of the bag put them on top of my other packed bags and fold the bag up and put it away Seriously I spent over $100 and I'm begrudged 1 paper bag Come on.

4826,0,From the other reveiews and what I have heard from a friend I might have to try narcisse again I was there for brunch this past sunday and was disappointed After being seated inside we waited 9 minutes before we were greeted Right when we were about to get up and leave our waitress finally appeared asking us if we would like to order a drink I ordered a nonfat cappucino and without even asking my boyfriend what he would like she just walked away clearly irritated that I had ordered a cappucino She came back a few minutes later saying they dont have nonfat milk We just weren't feeling it so we left and went somewhere else instead Im sure brunch is amazing but just the greeting we recieved left a bitter taste in my mouth.
4280,0,"Well what can I say about 1130  Its a great break-up spot great place to wait one hour for a simple pasta dish and a great place to get service that will strangely remind you of that girl in HS that no matter what you did you couldn't get her attentionSeriously though I would not recommend this place  The restaurant itself has a nice ambiance and is inviting  However almost immediately you notice that the waiters don't really seem interested or are not too friendly (mind blowing for a job that is all about hospitality)  A friend of mine didn't want a sauce on her pasta and the waiter didn't acknowledge her when she double checked the order  I flagged him down after he abruptly left so I could make sure the order was correct and his answer was ""Yeah I heard her"" to which my response was ""A reply of receipt would be nice""  The kitchen was also poor on delivery time  The restaurant was more than 3/4 empty and it took a little over an hour to get our food to the table (3 people)  Upon delivery it was obvious that the food had been left on the plate warmer too long or was cooked to the standards of a college cafeteria  The pasta was hardened on the outside and the chicken was WAY overcooked (Pasta Rustica)  Additionally it was evident that the pasta was not drained thoroughly and/or the sauce had something funky going on because there was a nice pool of water on the bottom of the plate  Forget getting a hold of your original waiter  We had to ask two other waiters for service because ours was somewhere in la-la land  Overall this place lacks on service and food quality  I have re-visited restaurants that lack in service but serve great food  This place has neither and will leave you wanting for WAY more."
4675,0,Horrible Service I went to pick up my orders and I ended waiting some time but no one came to attend me even after noticing me at the front door which is very awkward So I called the restaurant number and told that I am waiting at front door only then people came to attend me When I asked about that I didn't get proper response instead they were rude Actually I ordered some fish cakes and fried rice when I asked about whats there in my to go box I was told that it has fried rice and something in  thai which I didnt understand  When I asked is it fish cake the lady told you are the only one who ordered fried rice so its your order then later I found out that they mentioned the thai name for the fish cake But I feel its a rude behavior not sure how they are still in the business And food was not great especially fish cake was oily and had raw smell  I will never step in there in future There are lot of other better thai restaurants near by so avoid this place.

2547,0,This was probably the loudest restaurant I've ever eaten in My husband was sitting right next to me and we really had to raise our voices Our salad was missing a couple ingredients the cucumbers and peppers The sangria just tasted like cheap sangria nothing special The bread we ordered was plain and boring I have had better bread from the Wal Mart bakery Our pizza crust was burnt and flavorless The $11 dessert we had was probably the worst dessert I've ever had in restaurant It was the Dolce Della Casa which is a calzone filled w/ banana & hazelnut sauce We could hardly eat it because we needed a chainsaw to cut through the crust All that was inside was one measly banana We told the waitress we didn't like it and she said well sometimes it's hard to get it to cook just right She didn't take it off our bill or offer anything for us I feel bad because we were there for my husband's birthday and it was an awful experience.
814,1,This is one of my favorite spots in Phoenix The pizza is wonderful the pesto salad is absolutely amazing and the fresh fruit crepe is delicious They have a great patio and I've never had bad service here even on busy nights The servers always remember my husband and me even though we don't go more than once every few months.
4324,0,"I don't even want to give one star--is there a zero star optionWe have eaten at this Mellow Mushroom at least 10 times since they have opened and but service has always been mediocre  One of the reasons that we kept coming back is because we kept getting manager comped meals due to a variety of issues this location had  Tonight we went in for drinks and reverse happy hour after a birthday party at the establishment next door  There was a group of 20 of us there and after eating a full meal and sitting there for 2 hours- I had drank ONE drink when I went to order another drink was told that our entire party was cut off from drinks  Excuse me When I asked why exactly that was the bartender/manager on duty sarcastically and rudely said ""would you like me to call you a cab home"" and walked away  With zero explanation and a cocky bartender on his high horse thank you very much but I will never come back to this establishment again  At 11:30 at night on a Friday night I am not sure what sort of crowd you are expecting but I do not expect to be cut off after one drink This place promotes their variety of beers on tap and is a BAR  The service is horrible and if you want drinks/food there are plenty of other choice in the area do do not go to the City North Mellow Mushroom I highly recommend Modern Margarita or Kona Grill right next door."

2040,1,This place is incredible  Really great service delicious food and drinks and the manager even came by to thank us for coming in  The fries were amazing the chicken and waffles was amazing the beers were amazing the pretzels were amazing  the only thing that wasn't so amazing was the check at the end of the night but I'd say it was worth every penny.
529,1,Being that I've only been on ONE ride i thought this one was good  This is way below my threshold of fun for the dollar but it was for my Grandmother's 80th's bday and she really wanted to do it  Overall this is one of the cheapest deals I've found  $130 per rider I believer  Total of 12 in a basket  Oh yeah 12 in a basket is ALOT  Our guide was funny he was really skilled (he split 2 hills) and was very accommodating when it came to telling us about the balloon and how everything workedChampagne cheese and crackers at the end  With your yelp check in a free champagne glass etched with Rainbow Ryders  Nice way to commemorate.
269,0,Oopshad a discussion with our waiter Ramon about food allergies  He assured us all would be fine  halfway through the meal we discover the exact ingredient in the food  The waiter never says sorryThe manager  Tommy Buck  shows up after a 5 minute wait and  demonstrates lack of experience  He offers to comp the offending dish  I ask him if he has any managerial experience as none is demonstratedHe gets very  defensiveThis is a shame as the restaurant ambiance is nice and our first dish was excellent   It is a shame that there is no longer adequate training in the service industry.

983,1,"For all you seasoned yelpers out there I opened an account just to give this specific BR store a reviewthough I'm sure I'll be back to provide more reviews as my Dad taught me to give credit where credit is due I recently moved to the area and needed some assistance with a handbag I purchased at BR well over 5 years ago  This bag went with me everywhere and worked with almost anything  Recently the sealant on the side of the shoulder strap began to tear and crack  I visited another BR while living in a different state and the only help I received was ""get it fixed at a leather repair shop""  No attempt whatsoever to make it right  After visiting numerous leather repair shops they sent me back to BR as there was nothing they could do  Again I love this bag and quickly drove myself to my nearest BR ready for a throw down  The initial salesperson was helpful but not very encouraging  She gave me the usual ""this looks like normal wear and tear"" but asked to take my beloved bag and show it to her manager-Brody  Days passed and I was I sure that there was nothing they would do however the salesperson called me back to assure me that the manager would look into it but I needed to wait as he was out of town  Well Monday arrived and I received a call from Brody  He was personable and had already gone the extra mile by calling customer service  He told me that he would be unable to replace the bag (I figured that) but was willing to send me a VERY generous gift card to use towards the purchase of another bagWIN  And this was no wimpy gift card but enough to purchase almost any bag in their store  In fact I've already spotted a ringer for my bag that should be in the store soon  No arguments no hassle no brush off  I've read reviews regarding BR's return policy so I was doubtful I would get any help at this point but BR has changed how I look at their productThanks Brody."
4608,0,"We tried CHoP last weekend We went in with the intention to sit at the bar order a couple glasses of wine (or more) have an app salad and an entree (woo date night)When we walked in we were immediately impressed with the decor/ambiance It was  a nice (upscale) change from the typical places in the Chandler area We found a seat at the bar and ordered two glasses of wine while we perused the menu Try to stay 'healthy' we decided on chicken satay a salad and the pork chops The wine was delicious and the wine menu was impressiveThen the chicken satay came outI took the first bite and tried to figure out if I really liked the over-seasoned taste or if it was 'too much' - at the same time I realized that something was just 'off'My husband took a bite and said ""uh this is undercooked"" He cut the chicken down the middle to separate it from the skewer The chicken was RAW not just pink RAW If you have been to CHoP then you know it is really dark in there The chicken was SO raw that you could even see it in the darkI immediately spit out my second bite that i had taken in the meantime The bar waitress notices asks us if there is an issue to which we reply ""ya this is raw"" She looked concerned but not mortified like we were that we just ate raw chicken She asked if we wanted to order a different appetizer Confused as to what just happened we both said ""sure"" But as we looked at the menu (remembering that we ordered pork for the  entreeand raw pork is pretty bad too) we decided to cancel our order and go to Sauce In the mean time when our bartender heard what happened she came over and said ""well the good news is that as long as it reached a certain temperature it shouldn't do any harm"" (ummmmhuh) My husband replied ""if it was raw then it didn't reach a certain temperature trust me"" So - they comp'd our drinks (which was nice) But I was a little put off that the manager/owner didn't want to talk to us Maybe we left too soon."
4170,0,Unless you like to live in a roach infested apartment complex steer freaking clear of this placeI don't care how helpful the staff isI don't care how beautiful the pools areI don't care that they have free wifi for all their tenantsI do however really care if I have to live with roaches  This place was my living nightmare  I dealt with it for about 4 months and then finally the problem was resolved  I think I was down at the office about 1 a week to complain and set request spraying  The problem probably wasn't the management as much as it was the college kids with the wall of empty beer boxes separating their living room into two such rooms But still  It makes me frustrated to even think about itI will say this about the staff though They tried and tried for four straight months to correct the problem and they posted all kinds of notices to inspect our apartments AND they even evicted a tenant or two  So in all fairness they really did trySo what should you do now  Buy a house  Thank goodness I have control of what happens in these walls :).
4142,0,I agree with others who have said about the broth being too oily and fatty Noodles were fine but I couldn't even finish half the bowl before I started getting grossed out and had to eat from my husband's bbq pork sandwhich instead which was actually pretty decent I'm a big carnivore but even I thought the spring rolls lacked veggies too much meat and pretty tasteless Service was HORRIBLE You're lucky if u can even get some eye contact with the service once your meal has been served Soda was served straight from the can - no glass not even a straw Definitely not worth the 12 mile drive.
1803,1,"While I feel as though Teme is GREATLY lacking in the car wash department I feel as though this place really is as good as you're going to find in the area (check out my review for ""Clean Freak Car Wash"" on 44th) Their most expensive wash is $8 $7 if you have an ASU (or any university) ID Not only does the drive-through give you everything you need you have people IN the drive-through working on your car at the same time They have people to scrub your car down in the middle and to dry it off at the end You even get a complimentary air freshenerThey really take the time to make sure every area of your car is PERFECTLY clean and dry and won't let you leave until you are happy Wash Wizard is the ONLY place I will get my car washed from here on in I might go back to Clean Freak one or two more times just to get my money's worth (I stupidly signed up for their monthly package and can't cancel it until next month) But I'll always come back to these guys."

1964,1,Ate here tonight was sitting at the table next to another person who wrote a bad review  The coals in their oven died out from over use that's what happens when you are constantly moving pizzas in and out especially on a busy night  The guys making the pizza's did a great job cranking out pies as fast as they could but you can only fit so many in the oven at 1 time  The oven was not broken as another reviewer stated earlier  She also stated that it took an hour for her two pizza's funny we ordered the same time as you our pizza took 35 minutes and you received yours before we did  I'm tired of people acting like it's the end of the world when your order takes a little longer than normal  It's Friday night the place is packed you are there with friends and family enjoy your time out together or were you in a hurry to leave because your bratty son kept spilling his water and bumping into my wife's chair  The server had informed us about the situation prior to our order just like she did to the other tables around us  Pizza came out great as always and our server was very friendly and accommodating even when a 15 top of rowdy men were seated in her section  For a corporate restaurant chain the pizza is great  1/2  carafe of wine and a large pizza our check was just over $30  The location in DC ranch is beautiful but you end up with snotty btches like the other reviewer tonight  From what I recall she was in an 8 top with two children who couldn't stay in their seats most of the time the entire party were on cell phones and nobody seemed to be conversing I only saw 2 pizzas on your table along with 3 beers a salad and the rest glasses of water  So as an 8 top your check was probably around $60 which was  undoubtedly discounted after you made a scene complaining about how long it took  I will definitely be back the pizza is very good (much better than the Scottsdale quarter location) the staff is friendly just sometimes the guests need to lighten up if you wanted pizza in 30 minutes or less call dominoes.
4895,0,"Went with friends for my wife's birthday dinner The evening started off okay Went to the front area to check-in and get our buzzer Our friends hadn't arrived yet so waiting wasn't going to be much of an issue Told the girl that we would be having 6 total guests but 2 were a surprise for my wife so please make sure the staff doesn't say anything and to only have 4 place settings at the table I also told her it was my wife's birthday and to do whatever they do special for birthdays (Cheesy singing by the waitstaff included)We went to the bar to have a drink while we waited WAY overpriced drinks here $16 for a Merlot and a pina colada Strike 1Our pager goes off so I go up to have the staff seat us I remind the girl up front that the head count is a surprise for my wife's birthday The hostes takes us to our booth and says ""party of six"" to which I replied to her ""no it's 4"" So she went ahead and removed 2 of the 6 place settings Strike 2Our friends arrived shortly after we were seated They were brought over to sit with us and we ordered our drinks and appetizers Fried calamari and roasted artichokes were good Everyone else also enjoyed the avocado rolls So far the food is showing some promise over the dumb staffI ordered the chicken and sausage gumbo Everyone else was half through their dinners before I got my dish When it arrived the only thing resembling gumbo was the rice After the first taste it was very bland and resembled some kind of creamy stew of unknown origin Our waiter came by to ask if everything was okay and how the gumbo was After I told him it was so-so he just asked ""just okay"" smiled and walked away No checking to see if I wanted something else insteadAbout halfway through the gumbo I started to not feel well Our group ordered dessert which they were all gushing over after it arrived Unfortunately the girl up front never shared with anyone that it was my wife's birthday I had to say something to the waiter who smiled said Happy Birthday came back after 5 minutes with a couple of waitresses none of which looked thrilled to be there sang happy birthday dropped off what was supposed to be a sundae and walked awayAfter a bit my face started to swell I grabbed a waitress to ask if they happened to put clams in the gumbo which I am severely allergic to After checking with the chef she came back to inform me that they put clam juice in it Anyone who knows about gumbo knows that the classic recipe doesn't have any clams or clam juice in it And the menu has no claims of allergy causing foodsAfter a 20 minute ordeal of just trying to get the check so I could go get some pills from the nearby CVS we were able to cash out and go That was about the most embarassing and painful 20 minutes I've had in some time When I first said something to the waitress a woman came out from the back and simply said we're sorry touched my shoulder and went in the back again Our waiter came by asked if anyone came by to say anything and saw that I was having trouble seeing the bill to split it He offered to split the bill for us At no time did he offer to get a manager to come talk to us Shortly after the waiter left a manager did come over after hearing what happened from the woman in the back He offered to comp my gumbo and my wife's cheesecakeCount me out from ever stepping foot in this overpriced carnival of lousy food and mediocre cheesecake I'm from NY and I've had better cheesecake out of the freezer at CostcoThe staff was nice enough incompetent but nice Glad they offered an apology and to comp part of the meal but I'm still upset that I had to pay anything after this ordealNOTE: IF YOU HAVE FOOD ALERGIES MAKE SURE TO ASK BECAUSE IT WON'T BE ON THE MENU."
940,1,I always think of the word habit as a nice way to describe a drug problem For example Whitney Houston's coke habit (too soon) or Heidi Montag's plastic surgery habit I would say that I might have a Habit problem since I eat here about 4 times a week Think of Habit as the love child from an orgy between In-n-Out Five Guys and Smashburger but cheaper and more delicious It is from California like INO it has many topping choices like Five Guys and it has other non burger options like Smashburger (although no alcohol unfortunately)I've had almost everything on the menu and I highly recommend the Swiss Mushroom Char and the Albacore Tuna Sandwich The Sweet Potato Fries are very good I would actually say that they are better than anything I've had at more expensive burger joints (*cough* that means step up your game delux and FEZ *cough*)The malts and milkshakes are pretty good also I haven't tried requesting anything crazy like a Neapolitan shake but I don't doubt that they would make that for me All in all this is a great regular spot because it is cheap and consistently delicious And consistency is a very rare quality to find in these kind of fast food-like restaurants.
4493,0,FailBurgerAs i said in my review of Delux I'm still looking for a great burger place in central phx  This place let me down  Not that the food was terrible but it was just mediocre  First of all I had to wait for a table Usually a good sign  The waitress was about 16 she knew nothing about wine and was totally incabable of answering questions  The waitstaff bus their own tables so it takes longer to turn them  Then a 17 year old server was arguing with the 16 year old hostess about seating his section  TerriblePeople sweet potato fries taste pretty much the same everywhere lets calm down mmmkay  Thanks  This place blows a hole  Fox Restaurant Concepts is hit or miss  Bloom is a miss True Food is a Hit ZinBurger is a miss Sauce is a hit  etc etc etc  If you want a good burger and an overpriced bottle of wine that the server knows nothing about i suggest going to 5Guys Burgers grab one to go and get a bottle of wine from the grocery store just pick one with the coolest label  Same result.
2148,0,This place was good two years ago when it opened  I used to love it  They have since greatly increased their prices and decreased the quality of their pizza  We live in the neighborhood and the last three times we ordered pizza it was delivered cold  The cheese was skimped on and the sauce was almost non-existent  The crust was burned  The wings were well done on one side and almost raw on the other  The price for this fiasco came to around $30 - with the delivery charge  It was so bad we had to throw it out  What a rip-off.
4670,0,"I frequent the Zoyo location near my house so I was happy to see this location as I was driving around  That was until I got insideThe flavors were different from those I have tried so I asked for a couple of sample cups  The staff member on duty handed me one so I went and tried one of the flavors and came back as I wanted to try another before making my decision  I asked for another and the staff member after pretending not to hear me quipped back in a very rude tone of voice ""one per customer""  I was completely taken aback and wasn't sure that I heard him correctly given his tone  I asked what he had said and he repeated it almost yelling at me  Other customers noticed as well and looked over at him with a shocked look on their facesNeedless to say I will never be back here again  A shame the location closer to my home is always so friendly."
1654,1,I don't know about all those other negative reviews but I seriously crave this place Pho The service is friendly the place is CLEAN which is a BIG PLUS and most of all the food is great.
3775,0,I wouldn't even give this place one star We researched on the Internet and decided to check it out We drove an hour and when we reach the place it's freakn CLOSED There was nothing on the Internet about that Sign said closed for reorganization So we called to see when they would be open thinking that hopefully the would be open before I leave Phoenix in a week But guess what The freakn phone number had been disconnected Go figure Even if they were to call and say we're open tomorrow I wouldn't go back.
3669,0,I ordered our food online  I came there to pick it up  Nobody even asked me anything I had to go and ask for help  I finally got my food  Came back to the office  I started to eat my food and bit in to some weir plastic I started to look through my food and I found about 6 more pieces of Plastic  I called to speak to a manager on duty I told him what happened and he said I am sorry I do not know how plastic into your food  He assured me that he will credit my card and will send me a gift card so I can come back to the restaurant because he said he doesnt want to loose a customer  It has been a month and my card has not been credited and I never received a gift card  So if you want to go to a restaurant and choke on a plastic as I did do go to Genghis Grill in North Scottsdale  The people that work there they can care less about what happens to you.

3252,0,Honestly was SO disappointed by this place after all of the rave reviews and my love of phillys I thought it would be awesome I got there and it took me 20 minutes not exaggerating to put in my order because the employee was on and off the phone walking around and just couldn't concentrate for two seconds My friend and I were the only two people in the store and they messed up my order TWICE The first time my macaroni wedges were frozen and the second time they gave me a completely wrong sandwich I'm all for having fun at the work place don't get me wrong but the main employee who also took my order really seemed to be on some kind of drugs and super out of it she couldn't wrap her head around what I wanted or why my order was wrong She also proceeded to do handstands with another employee spotting her behind the counter really classy guys.
2303,0,Aww sh*t food poisoning.
267,1,Wow this place is fabulous  Everything is so fresh and tasty that you can enjoy a healthy and yummy meal without breaking the bank  The salad bar is huge and they have a fresh soup bar where you can choose numerous varieties of homemade soups  Great tasting desserts and frozen yogurt machine  Best Strawberry Lemonade I have ever tasted  You have to try this place you will not be disappointed  They need to open locations in the MidwestAlso I want to give a shout out to the server at the restaurant  His name is Oscar and he is so wonderful and funny  He made us all laugh and smile and Oscar is such a hard worker and everyone that visits this location has to say hello to Oscar because he is the nicest man ever.
2688,1,I love Michael Mina and I love steakhouses - independently of each other  Mr Mina's iteration of the classic steakhouse was superb Cocktails alone occupy their own separate binder (awesome) and BS has the most comprehensive wine list that I encountered while in AZ  I had the 10 oz filet which was pretty close to perfect asparagus and broccolini  The most awesome part of the meal was by far dessert  The beignets should win some kind of award  Waitstaff was lovely as well  Only thing I hated and didn't really understand Decor of the main dining roomit's tragic and confusedBottom line: If you're in Scottsdale you need to experience Bourbon Steak.
3256,0,Had an awful experience with Jimmy Woos  I wish I would have written this review a few weeks ago when it happened but it slipped my mind until just now  I group of us from work got take out from here and while I know take out leaves more room for error this was incredible  I got a kids meal because I wanted a little bit of everything and the dessert included  I got the shrimp lo mein that came with beef instead of shrimp they charged me for the fried rice which was supposed to be included and they didn't even give me my dessert which I was so excited about  Luckily I work with nice people so one of them went back to the restaurant for me to tell them how they completely messed up my order and they took off the fried rice charge and gave us a free dessert but just too much had gone wrong to recover me so I probably won't be back  Sorry Jimmy Woos I really did want to like you.
4977,0,My wife and I eat out five nights a week  We know what is acceptable and what is not when it comes to ambiance  We booked a table for the patioand dropped German's name as he is the Gran Fromage  When we arrivedon timewe were told no tables on the patio  We were given the choice of a table in the bar or a table in the dining roomGiven that the noise level was so pronounced in the barwe opted for a dark table in the dining roomWe sat down and when the server arrived with the water we were unable to communicate with each other as the noise level was intolerable  Not chicbut NOISE  So loud we opted to boltand went to another establishmentI think German does a great job at Local Bistro and would at Central Bistro ife he got the noise level down to an acceptable levelI was most unhappy that our reservation was not carried out as specifiedbut even more disappointed that the lame assed interior DECORATOR thought the noise would be acceptableInterior designers and Architects are idiots  They will blow smoke at you and have you think they know somethingwhen in fact most all are friggin hacksWill not return to any of his restaurantsas we found the noise to be a game changerGood luck with the over 35 crowd  You'll never make it.
540,1,First of all - very clean nail salon without any overpowering smell I am a hair stylist by trade and so I am VERY particular about sanitation in salons This place seemed to follow all the rules to protect their guests Secondly the space is large and airy I felt very comfortable and relaxed in their massage spa chairs The nail techs are all very pleasant and do a very thorough job My tech Wendy was great She not only did a terrific job with the services she also turned me on to a great Vietnamese Restaurant.

1318,1,What can I say It's a candy warehouse If you like only the white gummy bearsyou can buy only the white gummy bears This place has a lot of those throw back candies that are hard to find I highly recommend this place if you have a sweet tooth or if you are looking for something in particular They have something for everyone young or old.
4395,0,"A friend and I went here for lunch today We received a lukewarm (I'll be with you guys in a minute) greeting from a server Same server took us to our table piss poor attitude Our actual server provided the same lukewarm greeting Note to restaurants: TRAIN your servers to not address guests as ""You Guys"" especially when one of the guests is a lady We ordered a pizza with tomatoes mushrooms and sausage (sausage only on half) They messed up our first pizza and brought us out another This restaurant is nothing like the namesake in Brooklyn Decent food bad service I will not be going back here or any other Grimaldi's except the original in Brooklyn."

1794,1,"After a weeklong vacation to Arizona and three visits to Green within that week I can say that this is the best vegetarian/vegan restaurant I have ever been toTried a few new dishes this week including the mexicali burger the artichoke gratin the buffalo wings and three flavors of tsoynamis  All were so good  The wings were delicious and amazingly ""real"" in texture and taste  The tsoynamis are freakin' awesome - the first one I had a few years ago I didn't really think the texture was quite right  But I definitely think its exactly like a blizzard but with better flavors like fluffer-nutter (pb banana marshmallow fluff yum)But nothing beats the old standby of a no harm chicken parm with chili fries on the side  The fries are the best fries ever and the chili is so good  The no harm parm sandwich makes my mouth water just thinking about it  Like I said before if they opened up in my neck of the woods I could totally be vegan."
72,1,This place is great I have been here about 5 times I like my stir fry spicy and they have just enough spices for me to mix in with all my fresh vegi's You can fill your bowl up with all the fresh meat and vegi's you want and they add your noodles or whatever you want at the endThe price's are not to bad they are a little cheaper for lunch than yc's and a little more at dinner time but you can get a frequent buyers cardI love this place and will keep going back as long as it's open.

1847,1,I dine out regularly and found my experience at Chelsea's to stand out above the rest The food was very fresh and prepared just as I had asked The fresh tuna tacos ROCK We also sat on the patio which I have to say is the best patio setting in town The staff were friendly and made our experience more enjoyable The energy inside the restaurant was upbeat and everything seemed to flow well I'm definitely going back.

3147,0,Came here for dinner with my wife  Entered and there were about 10 college males inside having drinks  We ordered a turkey sandwich and a roast beef sandwich  Also ordered one piece of bruschetta  The sandwich was not good  The lettuce was old and wilted the bacon seemed like it had been sitting way too long because it smelled funny and was not fresh  We were told we could not choose between the chips and salad because they were out of chips  We were told they get their fresh deliveries on Friday  It was Thursday so that explained why everything tasted old and nasty  The bruschetta tasted like jam and breadI would not recommend to place for food  It is very close to ASU so it might be geared toward young college students who do not appreciate good food and just go for the drinks.
1397,1,"WOW  Going to make this shortThis place is awesome because1  The pizzas are truly gourmet BUT you can get other five star dishes that have nothing to do with pizza as well (superb cheese/meat plates duck over quinoa wild fish etc)2  Even though this place is called ""The Parlor"" and a pizza place automatically comes to mind the atmosphere is nothing like a ""pizza place"" - very nice bar dining area and garden patioI'm not a big pizza fan but this is the best pizza I have had AND their other signature dishes (that have nothing to do with pizza) are excellent  Great wine list too."
1773,1,I can't say enough positive things about this location The staff is pleasant and helpful even when I come strolling in at 430am I love that this gym is fully staffed 24 hours a day and all of the equipment is immaculately maintained Most of the machines are also equipped to where you can just plug your headphones straight into the machine to listen to TV - super awesome The locker room is so clean and spacious At my last gym I dreaded having to get ready for work in the locker room after my workout but here I have no problems They have free wi-fi as well Check them out.

796,0,I realize this is a fast food place but I have to say that the food my wife and I had was not great at all I had the fried pork tenderloin sandwich which was a combination of who knows what's pig part The majority was fat and gristle My wife had a burger which was greasy and not all that memorable The girl ringing us up was rude and unhelpful when asked about items on the menu We did not have any custard which there known for but we were so displeased with everything that we didn't want to give them anymore of our money We will not be going back.
4729,0,I ordered 3 items to go one of which was chicken tikka masala and  I didn't get it we were charged for it but we got a beef dish with lots of bones I was pretty disappointed I don't think I will be back.
4505,0,So I visited this LA Fitness on a guest pass to see how I liked the facility Thank God I never paid anything to go there When I showed my guest pass I had to present it to a young kid sitting at a desk who said he'd take my driver's license that day as an exchange and I'd just have to get it from him when I was done with my class I thought it was weird that I didn't actually get an official pass but whatever So I return the next day and of course it was an issue Not only that the GM basically reprimanded me for something his own worker failed to do AND called me a liar When I produced my guest pass on my phone he annoyingly tossed it back at me When he asked why I didn't have a membership already I told him that I kinda work at a fitness studio He insulted my place of work by saying he had never heard of it Obviously he hasn't it's a women's only dance studio Then he preceded to pitch me membership options and tell me about his son that is going to be a big rapper Really I never returned to finish my 9 days left of my guest pass even that wasn't worth it Just the fact that LA Fitness employs complete degenerates to run one of their locations doesn't bode well for the company itself And judging from the lack of good reviews for this place without anything being changed well I'm not sure I trust LA Fitness at allAs for the 2 classes that I took they were ok but the mats that they provide are ridiculous - they're clearly not cleaned and most of them are ripped apart.
3727,0,"Drove around Scottsdale looking for the waterfront and all we saw was a small dirty man-made canal  Not much of a waterfront is it  Another disappointing Scottsdale ""attraction""  Not worth searching for or traveling to   I don't know why the city would even have signs directing people here  It's even labeled on the tourist maps and everything  Waste of time."
2126,0,My wife and I and our two son have for years gone to Haus Murphy for Christmas Eve dinner  We all have lived in Germany for an extended time and a German dinner for our family and our son's wive and girlfriend so a Christmas eve German dinner has become a tradition  The year before last the woman who runs the place didn't treat us very well (a party of 6)  We tried again last year and they treated us even more shamefully  We all decided that our experience with Haus Murphy has come to an end  It's a shame but each time the woman has pushed us impatiently to finish and we'd made reservations for 7:00 but none the less the lady did everything but put our order in a box and shove us out the door  Even something as simple as bread with dinner was with heldPerhaps any other time of the year but not on Christmas eve  If they don't want customers on the 24th they should just close for the day.

3806,0,"Terrible Apparently Robert purchased Rosa's (in 2008 or prior) and is now the owner I took in a BCBG formal gown to have the sides taken in bra cups sewn in a clasp fixed and the hem shortened less than an inch The dress was purchased from Last Chance but was in PERFECT condition when I took it to him The clasp was sewn in upside down the sides were bunching and not smooth at all and the hem was completely crooked One side of the dress was two inches shorter than the other side He did not take ownership of his mistakes at all Kept saying ""It's not my fault someone else sewed the hem crooked I took an inch off all the way around"" He did not pin the hem all the way around to make sure it would be even and he cut the excess material off so there was no way for it to be fixed Awful A gorgeous dress completely ruined for my brother's wedding He said it would be done Monday and I called to ensure it was ready for pick up He said ""I have a few more things to do on it"" A few more things turned out to be everything He had just started working on it and didn't even provide a courtesy call that it would be late I tried it on the next day and found the horrible results 10 days before the wedding and I now have to find a new dress which will most likely need alterations I will not be going to Rosa's (Robert)."
3068,1,This place is Great  I took my family there Sunday morning to watch some football and eat breakfast/lunch  The atomsphere was good and the food was awesom I know it is an Italian place but I had an omelette with green pepers onion ham and cheddar  It was unbelieveable and I am guessing it had at least 4 eggs Kid friendly for football as well  I would go there again and probaly will on Sudnay.
3894,0,Cultureless chain restaurant with bland food Employees are more interested in flirting with each other at the host stand than to acknowledge you when you walk in or walk out.
1246,1,Just got back from Kiku SushiYUMM How much fun is a revolving sushi buffet We loved it We ate until we were stuffed along with two giant beers for $40 The sushi was fantastic The egg roll was cold but I just told them and they took it right away The cucumber salad was cold tasty and a great palette cleanser Our waitress JoJo was eager to get us to try her favorites and you can tell she is proud of the food they serve The whole staff greeted everyone as they entered Really great vibe reasonable prices delicious food revolving around the room and cold beerthis is my idea of a good time.
4912,0,Horrible foodBad ServiceGreat locationGood for a beer or drink nothing moreThe food is scary bad and disgusting to even look atNo flavor bland or dried outYUCKDont plan on anything other than spending the night on the tiolet iafter you eat that food.
2140,1,All night happy hour Yep Can't beat it In addition to their normal happy hour during the week they also extend it to all day Sunday and Monday The only downside is its only in the bar and front patio but hey for that deal you can make it workI got the green chili pork stew on the recommendation of the waiter It comes with a side of warm tortillas and is the perfect size for a filling meal without feeling stuffed The pork was delicious and cooked perfectly The cheese topping and the extra zing from the chilis made this absolutely delectable Definitely a must try If you want a go to place that always has great food great service and good atmosphere this is your place Will definitely be backagain.
4227,0,First time I went they were out of 4 or 5 items so I came back a few days later got some crappy overcooked Mac and cheese flavorless brisket on a cold hard bun Went back today and they were closed during hours posted Place won't see the new year.
1066,1,If I could marry soup I would do it I mean I love soup more than life itself and there are days when I have a soup that makes my husband come in a distant second (and I love HIM to pieces) This is how I feel when I order soup from Vermont Sandwich Company Today's choices Roast Beef Vegetable & Chicken Florentine were both fantastic Yep I orderd a cup of each instead of a soup and a sandwichseriously it's THAT FREAKING GOODThey make these soups fresh every day so you call in the morning to find out what today's pot of gold will be A few weeks ago I called the day before and not only did they not know yet what the soups would be the next day I GOT TO PICK THEM Holy mother of Pearl did that make me a happy girl The standard French Onion is incredible but the potato leek or corn chowder are also fantastic Heck I haven't ordered a soup yet that didn't put me over the moon In store one day got to sample the Country Apple as well(drool)And don't forget the cookies Yep Maple baconjust saying.
3612,0,Room 123 is supposed to be a non-smoking room however there was a lingering stench of cigarette smoke and cigarette burns in the comforter and the chair Internet access painfully slow The bed was the most uncomfortable hotel bed I've ever slept in The toilet consistently ran all night None of the most basic amenities in the room upon arrival such as shampoo conditioner lotion coffee packets etc TV remote took a lot of figuring out on how to switch over from cable to the DVD player Perhaps because I'm a director of food and beverage for a large hotel I'm overly-picky but overall I was very underwhelmed by my stay not a 2-star quality hotel in my view --- Ending on a positive note front desk staff was very welcoming and accomodating.
3509,0,"Ugh They have some good commercials for this place currently playing Unfortunatelythat's where the ""good"" stops with this place Everything was terrible from the service to their food I think their Diet Coke even tasted horrid We ordered their Mexican Waffle with ice creamthey actually made Eggo's taste good which is not saying much Frost bitten and just ewww If a 6 yr old doesnt want dessertsomething's wrong with your place I will NEVER go here again and if this saves even one person from eating here I feel I've done my job Do yourself a favor and don't go here it's disgusting."
1928,1,Same great food new location  I like the leaner brisket but have tried everything at different locations and EVERYTHING is good  Forget the sissy sause and just go with the good stuff BUT this stuff is so good try it without first  There are no plates so just get over it the food wont be there long anyway.
878,1,I love love love everything about Liberty Market Everything from the staff to the food and their selection of wine and beer I'm a frequent diner at Liberty Market and while you can usually find me there for their amazing breakfasts during the week I'm also a huge fan of dinner as well especially since they mix up the menu on the weekends and usually have something different every weekIf you have a chance get your butt out here It's amazing (PS My faves: Cortado and the demi-breakfast with a blueberry pancake and bacon Yummy).
1812,1,Wow  I loved the bobby  This thing was so amazing  If you ever want to fix your thanksgiving craving go to Capriottis  Thankfullybthwy had a yelp deal or I probably wouldn't have tried this place  YUMMY.
590,0,Had the same issue with the 45 minute prior check-in  I heard of such a thing being 30 minutes prior to check-in due to security reasons we were at the 35 minute point so they definetely said no  Their computers had already siezed up is what we were told a security measurefederal rules to be exact  Funny cuz Allegiant does no such thingSo we were stuck in Reno for the night and got the next flight out said my buddies bag was to large for the over head compartment yet it was fine on the arrival  So he had to pay  The couple in front of us had a bag that weighted 51 pounds 1 pound over and gave them grief  The lady freaked out and started taking out shoes and clothes and shoving it in carry ons  I don't blame her 1 pound over really  They don't know what customer satisfaction is I'll stick with Southwest and Allegiant thanks .
3382,0,"Pretty annoyed with this place  Only reason I am ok with giving them any stars is they had Kiltlifter on tap otherwise i would strongly campaign for a zero star review  I got the ""Miss Priss"" it tasted like sour garbage Mushy warm sour garbage How do you mess up a turkey sandwich  YUCK  My friend got the ""Hawaii chicken"" he quickly named to vomity badness the chicken breast was brown not dark meat BROWN I was going to take my leftover 3/4 of a sandwich and give it to a homeless person or something but i didn't want to make they're day any worse So long story short if you wanna go spend 13501700 with tip spend that money somewhere else because mill is popping off with waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaayyyyyyyy better places than this chronic tacos next door looks interesting and the munchies deli as well."
32,1,I have been getting my hair cut & colored by Mia for years  She is the most cheerful down to earth person you'll ever meet  I am picky when it comes new color or cuts but the next day after seeing her I am always ecstatic how awesome my hair looks and feels after trying something new.
1191,1,Wow My taste buds haven't been THIS excited in a long time The food was truly amazing the service so friendly and the ambiance very casual and relaxed Even as I type this the flavors of the yassa chiken and the goat curry still linger strongly in my gustatory memory My friend and fellow yelper John M and I also had the pleasure of having the lovely Chef Esther Mbaikambey come over to chat with us I know I will be coming back here very often and I look forward to their all-you-can-eat Sunday (noon to 4 pm) where you can choose as many as you want (3 to start order more if you've finished the 3) from pepper soup eguisi soup pof-pof fish and couscous yassa chicken curry chicken and jolof rice - all for $999 - soda included.
1849,1,I love love love the Spa LamarI go whenever I get a chance They have a great deal The first Wednesday of every month you take a friend and get HALF OFF both of your services thats a deal if you ask me The staff is always amazing and professional I never want to leave Every person I have taken there has gone back and loves it.
1693,1,"The food the decor the happy hour ""sigh' I will miss this place as much as I will miss my friends out in Arizona I just came back from visiting & I am so glad we went to Blue Wasabi I'm not going to sit here & list everything I ate All i'm going to say is EVERYTHING I ate was good My friends & I ordered most of the Happy Hour menu To drink I had a cherry bomb Words can not describe the happiness that was my lips & tongue JOY JOY JOY I have NEVER had a drink as good as that one & trust me I've had ALOT of drinks Don't be intimidated by the fact that the guys behind the bar are not Japanese They are trained sushi chefs & have years of experience If I could I would move to Arizona just so I can be closer to the Blue Wasabi Oh & the customer service was on point GO."
3580,0,I wish I could give this place 0 stars  My god the server really ruined a fun night out for my group  A large group of friends and I decided to meet here to celebrate two birthdays and watch the ASU game  By the time I arrived there were probably about 15 to 20 people  I sat at a table and when the server arrived I asked for a beer and to start a tab with just my boyfriend and I  IMMEDIATLY the server coughed up an attitude and said everyone was on one tab sorry  Since I had just arrived I didnt see a reason why I shoudnt be allowed to start my own tab so she let me but not without a couple snarky comments to our table  My friends let me know that she had been rude from the very beginning when there was only 4 people to start with  Anytime she came by the table (which wasnt all that frequently) a couple people were ready for another round  People would start ordering and she would huff and puff and complain that things were getting just too darn complicated  Perhaps she could remember things easier if she would have written our order down  Now let me just say that I can understand a servers frustration with big groups  I work at a bar myself and things can get complicated  Perhaps if she reads this review she'll learn that most people want seperate checks and its just easier to assume that from the beginning to keep things clear  Also someone commented that she was the only server on the patio  SHAME ON THE MANAGEMENT for having one server serve a busy patio on a saturday night not to mention the fight and ASU game were on to make it even busierRemember that SEPERATE tab I started with my card for my boyfriend and I  Well it turns out she just decided to throw a bunch of our beers onto the other tab because she couldnt keep things straightagain writing things down would really have helped out  I don't know if the server was new or what but she was disorganized and incredibly rude  I couldnt believe how much attitude she was giving usisn't a large tab a good thing  I've never before had a server who literally rolled her eyes and walked away from patrons who were looking to spend money UNBELIEVABLE  WORST SERVICE EVER.
1164,1,Green flannel was delicious as was the fresh squeezed orange juice My husband had the banana nut cakes and also loved them  We had great service and the servers actually seemed happy to be working here which is a nice change of pace Will definitely return.
1433,1,This is THE place to go if you're a celiac Everything on the menu is labeled - and a big portion of the menu is actually gluten free The servers are friendly and knowledgeable and the food - well the food is amazing However it's VERY pricey - especially with all of those amazing cocktails (muddled strawberrys c'mon) I have only dined here for dinner but I loved every bite of it I would choose to go here for ANY special occasion They even brought out a free birthday GF dessert They're great go here as soon as you can.
2484,1,Everything about this place is wonderful I love the huge windows and outdoor patio Gorgeous Their food is amazing everything from the chips (there are about 5 different chips in the basket) and salsa to dessert They have some of the best margaritas in town Yum My favorite thing on the menu is the goat cheese stuffed chicken with roaster red pepper sauce This is to die for.
4012,0,"A friend and I went here a couple weeks ago on a random Wednesday night to get a quick bite to eat  Having not had Chinese food in a while (in a state that lacks any real great Chinese food) we decided to give Wong's Place a shot  We ordered the twice-cooked pork and the beef chow fun in black bean sauce  Neither of the dishes were really that great  The twice-cooked pork was far too sweet and overloaded with vegetables as filler and the beef chow fun was greasier than I'd preferAnd to seal the deal a classmate of mine whom I saw working there later informed me to avoid eating here because they allegedly ""recycle"" the rice there  You got it the last table's leftover white rice is now being added into your pot and served to youIf you're looking for legit Chinese food you're better off going somewhere elseEdit: Based on recent reviews perhaps the 1-2 star reviews aren't getting their point across  Here's a list of places you're better off going to:1 Asian Hong Kong/Hong Kong Asian Diner (the name escapes me but it's on the NW corner of Rural and Ray)2 Panda Express3 Subway4 FilibertosAs you can see while there are more legitimate (and delcious) Chinese restaurants to eat at it seems that just about ANYWHERE is a better choice than Wong's  Please just let them go the way of Chrysler and eat somewhere else."
1075,1,One of the most beautiful places in the valley  A tour here is a must  They have great clubs (I am a member of the Monarch society) and great events.
2188,1,the best clean sushi fresh all the food is out of this world different desserts vegetables fruit  it is amazing  the place is clean.

2888,1,We showed up at the Mesa location on a Friday night around 6:30 and even though the restaurant seemed full we were seated immediately I must say that I really appreciate a nice hostess and the service we received from the time we stepped in the door to the time we left was always above and beyond We were seated in the back corner of the restaurant which was lovely because we were able to observe the lively staff and take in the design of the restaurant Our server gave us great recommendations on drinks and food and we left satisfied and already planning our next visit back This restaurant gets an A++ for being delicious friendly and having a great environment I can't wait to dine at the Blue Adobe Grille again.

805,1,I really enjoy this place for breakfast Really comfortable seating and nice ambiance  I like the sausage and egg with cibatta  Prices not a steal but comfortable enough Coffee selection is nice as well.
669,1,Oil change was complete in a surprising 10 minutes the staff was very professional and courteous the waiting room was tidy and well air-conditioned and they gave my car a thorough vacuum and window wash  They did run through their usual upsell drill but I have never had any oil change or car repair done where whoever it was at Jiffy Lube or not didn't put me through the upsell drill  They honored my $13 off coupon (got mine in the mail)  This particular Jiffy Lube is a newer location and feels more clean and inviting as a result  Also the location seemed less busy than others (or perhaps I just got lucky on timing)  I'd recommend this location.
3968,0,Honestly I'm a bit surprised by the number of good reviews  My experience was far from positiveService was terrible  As the four of us in our party observed the waitress made a habit of bringing hot food out on a cart from the kitchen and rather than immediately serve it to the table she would stop by other tables on the way takes orders ask if they needed anything etc  This happened multiple times  Seems to me that should be the other way aroundI ordered the chicken fajitas  The rest of my party was served their food about 10 minutes before mine  That is also unacceptable  They felt bad about eating without me and I didn't want their food to get cold  The kitchen needs to learn how to time food so an entire table's order comes out at onceWe had to ask our waitress several times for napkins silverware and salsaAfter all of this the food was sub-par  My chicken lacked any resemblance of flavor  The rice and re-fried beans were fine except for the clearly over-cooked dried out edges of beans around the plate  The only person who mostly enjoyed their food had ordered a chicken quesadilla  At least they can get cheese and tortillas to cook rightThey also charge $250 for a second helping of chips and salsa  I've never been to a Mexican restaurant where they charge for more chips & salsaOverall being my first Mexican restaurant experience in Arizona I'm VERY disappointed(come on guys I can throw a rock to the border  I expected better)  I definitely won't be back.

479,1,Awesome food Very consistent and I am a sucker for the Satay green curry chicken and the pad Thai is smookin hot The place is not fancy And only seats about 1205 They have a huge takeout business I have never been disappointed They know you by name and always know I am a diet pepsi guy and bring out the satay to start I dont have to even ask Give it a try your gonna get hooked Average plate is about 7-9 bucks.
2743,0,"This is the 2nd such Hibachi Grill I have tried in as many weeks Food was less than tasty and much more limited choices than the one at Metro Mall by Black Angus This one was a lot less clean but the biggest difference was the variety and amount of selections The one at Metro Mall had at least 14 tables of food whereas the Arrowhead (Glendale) one had only 8 That makes a big difference In addition the food at Arrowhead was much less tasteless The cuts of ""Prime Rib"" appeared to have been there since they opened and looked more like pot roast The cost was only $799 per person (dinner not lunch) but in my opinion $599 would have been overpriced for the quality of the food I will go back to the one at Metro Mall and gladly pay the $999 per person for a much higher quality food and many more choices."
336,1,This is one of my favorite Mexican food joints in town  We've been going here for 4 to 5 years and each time have had a great meal  The food is consistent and savory  The atmosphere is somewhat basic but they have a great value for the food served  If you like a hotter than average salsa the green Hatch chili salsa is awesome  The sopapillas at the end of the meal are always a wonderful treat.
4792,0,Went in on 12/23 to shop for foundation from Clinique - was high jacked by Smashbox - spent 22413 sadly while processing it the system showed it failed so they ran it again as a credit card - ultimately charging me twices for the same purchase Nordstroms denied processing it twice yet - there it wasmy bank finally removed the charge only to have Nordstroms push the charge through 5 days later - AGAIN I knew this had to be an issue so took it to another level the regional manager - what a waste of time - she can not call me back and sends the Manager at Nordstroms who denied all of this call me instead Now I finally get a call back to inform me that this happened to SEVERAL people and now I am facing 5 NSF fees from my bank - because of them and they want me to give them ANOTHER 5 days to process this.
2439,0,"Wow  These reviews are shocking  Maybe I just went on a bad afternoon  I'm not going to say how bad the food was but instead I'm going to try it again - just to see if its me or the foodWell the fried spinach tasted like sheets of greased toilet paper (if you can imagine that) and the mash potatoes had a stronger metalic after taste  Everything about the potatoes said ""don't eat me""  The fish wasn't too bad however  The waitress stood right behind me and was bascially shouting in my ear so much so that I moved my seatBut its a real cute place and the wine was excellent."
1139,1,After owning my home for 9 years and hiring various people including some highly advertised plumbing companies some individual contractors and several handymen  - I feel that I have finally found the best of all the rest   The reviewers were not exaggerating  Not only did Mike give a very reasonable quote but in addition to doing the work that I had hired him for he fixed a couple of other things that had been done incorrectly by a previous handyman   His hourly rate is right up front on his website and the time that he estimated was more than it took to do the work so my cost was less  How rare is that  There are not enough adjectives to describe but they would include fair honest capable efficient and personable plus he was on-time  I would highly recommend Mike and now have the peace of mind of having someone to call who I trust when I need work done on my home.
2100,1,WOWI love this Food Truck  Devin & Cat are everything you hope to encounter when walking up to a food truck for the first time  A real 'small business' eat local type feel and the warmth you would expect from a family run businessOn to the food:I have only eaten 1 item from Q Up  and as far as I am concerned it could be the last thing I ever eat in my life  This sandwich is RIDICULOUSThe Gangsta Grilled Cheese could quite possibly be the best sandwich ever created  It includes ingredients like BBQ Mac & Cheese and Sourdough  Need I say more  Anyone who doesn't like this meal is crazy  Also worth mentioning that the BBQ alone is top notch  The sauce is perfectly balanced and the meat is so tender and delicious I think it might be made from unicornsI could go on and on about how much I like the experience from Q Up but am getting hungry and they are not out right nowI am a bit of a Food Truck Junkie and tend to be a bit critical Q Up Passed with flying colors  Keep up the good work.
648,1,This Starbucks is clean The employees are friendly The manager Janora is fantastic I liked it so much here I wanted to work here and got hired.
3498,0,After heavy shopping I tried to get out of my comfort zone and try Rubios I got the original taco Boy was that sucker dry Even after downing it in hot sauce it still tasted like a microwavable fish fillet and the portion of the fish unlike the huge picture displayed was like the size of an anchovy   Also I was displeased when the lady at the counter when I asked for a small drink cup gave me a  regular cup I saw another customer had a small cup What a waste of money $6 for a crappy meal honestly this place makes Chipotle fine dining.

4474,0,I thought I would try out this location big mistake First parking is a nightmare Second I sat inside first and went unnoticed for 10 minutes Then a fight broke out so I moved to the outside bar where there was no bartender Twenty minutes in I was getting up to leave when waitress finally asked if I wanted a beer a 3 dollar pbr wasn't bad so I figured why not I felt completely ignored for 30 minutes  will never come back I'm halfway through my pbr and can't wait finish it so I can leave.
3617,0,"I had a problem with a coolant leak on the top of my 2008 Ford Expedition engine  I had had my AC repaired a year earlier at this shop without concern so I when to Greulich's on Ray Road again to have them provide me with an estimate to repair the coolant leakI arrived about 4 PM on a Weds and explained the problem  With little discussion the Service Writer (Kelly15) took my keys to have a mechanic ""take a look""  There was no discussion about any fees to get an estimateAbout 45 minutes later I was presented with an estimate of $155893 to have a couple hoses replace and to remove and replace the engine intake manifold  I was dumbfounded because it was obvious that the hose was leaking at some of the manufacturing joints and spraying down on the engine  I challenged the Service Writer and said I didn't think the manifold was the problem  He assured me that his ""Master Certified"" mechanic confirmed the need of manifold replacementIn disbelief I said that I would have to have another garage provide me with an estimate before proceeding at which time I was asked to pay $5850 plus tax for the mechanic's time  Bull S I was never advised that an ""estimate"" came with a $5850 shop bill  With a firm (read LOUD) voice I said ""I'm not paying your bill"" and my vehicle was returned to meLong story short I purchased the replacement hose assembly from a retail automotive store and the necessary antifreeze to replace the hose  After 200 miles I observe no additional leakage  Total repair cost in parts was $13995 and a couple of hours of my time  Total SAVINGS to me $141898  It goes without a second thought that I will not be using Greulich's services and will have reason to tell others why I have reached my decision."
2581,1,I almost bought a used car at a traditional dealership They told me how they have the mechanic look over the car and they only sell cars in perfect condition I had my mechanic look it over and he found over $1200 in repairs needed The next day I went to see Bob Bloom at Centennial He showed me the carfax and the off site inspection and repair bill Centennial isn't a traditional dealership All the cars are inside and they set a fair price No need to negotiate We bought my son's first car from Bob and it was a great experience I recommend you call Centennial and ask for Bob you won't regret it Tell them Pat sent you :).

2968,1,"My favorite place in the valley  Mostly because it is next door to where I live but have ALWAYS had a good time here  Some people in the Scottsdale/Chandler area do not like it because it is not exactly the ""Scottsdale"" crowd much more laid back You don't have to dress up in heels to go either flip flops are fine on Friday and Saturday nights  But if you are in heels beware of actual sand outside Bartenders are always friendly just a good place to chill with friends  Also the Baja fish tacos are awesome here  The nachos are ok too  They also show UFC fights each month and a fun place to watch football on the weekends."
3122,0,Avoid this office altogether  Too many things wrong to list i have been to dentists offices before and after not requiring fillings this office said that i needed 3+ of them  after declining fillings on the visit the front desk person then proceeded to negotiate my out of pocket coinsurance in an effort to encourage me to do the service that day (which i declined and just had a cleaning) i advised her that to my knowledge negotiating coinsurance was not legal because of my previous insurance work experience 5 months later i receive a bill (not past due) with not explanation of services  This office is ethically questionable AVOID.

2316,0,"Horrible experience yesterday  One of the worst experiences I've had at a restaurant  In fact leaving this review is what urged me to finally sign up on Yelp  I work on Mill  I went there with 7 friends from work Friday for lunch  The place was only 1/3 full So really not that busy We were seated quickly but then the following series of events occurred: - 10 minutes later our waitress took our drink order-  15 minutes later food order - 40 minutes into our experience 2 of us got our food-  10 minutes later 3 more of us got our food - 10 min later  the waitress came over and asked us if we're missing anything YES 2 of us still don't have food and we've been here for an hour  The waitress asked ""do you want me to go check on that""  Come on Right  No we'll just hang out for another hour and see what happens  )- 5 minutes later she brings one of my friend's dishes over he asks that it be put in a box as we have to get back to work now- 15 minutes later his boxed up food isn't there yet We have to ask 5 more minutes it comes and it's a chicken bowl he ordered beef HA- My other friend who still never got his food cancels his order- We get our check and it was incorrect We had free appetizer coupons And the 2 free appetizers were not free on our checks Waited for that to be corrected tooIt was absolutely ridiculous Thank goodness I was there with friends We were laughing at the situation the whole time If I was there by myself I probably would have shot myself in the face."

3394,0,Unreal  I just spent $8 or $9 for 5 pigs in a blanket  Seriously  Not even a whole hotdog  What a rip  I asked the waitress for a recommendation   Clearly a ton of profit for them  Check the picture.

2752,0,"Yet another example of a restaurant chain that has been crapped out of the back end of corporate America  I went to this place because a couple of friends preppy white boring friends recommended it  I should have known I would hate it  First I walk in thinking it would at least be sit down but no it's a fast food  You have to go to the counter  I guess the new terminology that folks are using in order to convince white yuppies with money is 'fast casual'  Not fast food - fast casual  I guess the difference is that they bring the food to your table  Well isn't that a fancy cup of hot teaAnd then there's the menu which bring up the question  What do you get when you cross a Panda Express with another Panda Express  You get this craphole called Pei Wei at twice the price  And how do you pronounce it  PeeWee  Is that supposed to be cute  Hello Kitty meet average corporate Asian dumpBut what bugs me the most is I saw what type of clientele this place attracted  The same folks who would scream at forking over an extra buck at a locally owned Asian restaurant are giving away the bank for bland typical run of the mill food that you could find at your local Dennys  White people just piss me off and I can say that because I'm white  You didn't see Asians in there  You didn't see any Latinos and you certainly didn't see any Black folk  All you saw were a bunch of white preptards that would fit in nicely at a Jeff Foxworthy concert  ""You know your a redneck when you eat at Pei Wei Asian dinner and you really think you are getting a taste of real Asian culture  Hell yeah""I know how you are thinking that you are going to teach your kids what real Asians eat and in a environment that is true to the Asian culture and you'll show your little snot head kids how to eat with chopsticks so they can learn to become the brain dead pretentious adults that their parents have become but in fact they know just as much about true culture as a plastic forkWell that's how I saw the whole thing  Parking was good."
4961,0,Heard nice things about Five Guys and tried to go while I was in Portland but didn't make it I found out about the new location in Surprise and paid a visit   I went on a Saturday about 12:30 which was probably a mistake The place was packed and it took about 25 minutes to get my order You could hardly hear the numbers called because of the music and crowd noise  The food tasted ok but is a bit messy to eat It has good portions but I paid $1313 for the bacon/ cheese burger with large fries no drink so it's a bit spendy It's probably not a place I would go to again In/out burger is quicker cheaper and is not as messy to eat so I'll stick with them in the future.

1421,1,"WARNING: LONG but THOROUGH review  :-)I've visited Briggs Family Dentistry twice now originally chose them based on prior reviews and the fact they've been received multiple ""Top Dentists"" awards (""Top Docs"" edition of Phoenix magazine is where I first learned of them)Rates are on the pricey end but are competitive for the Scottsdale area and are accompanied by an amazing (dare I say ""unbeatable"") experience If you need extensive or pricey work done like me (two crowns) they also do what they can to aid in the financial department (payment plans cash discount) which is great for those of us who don't have dental insurance I love that they do NOT have high pressure sales but simply - honestly - state what kind of work you'll need or can expect in the future They also do NOT recommend unnecessary treatments as I've experienced with every other dentist (ie ""you should get whitening this 'might' be a cavity so let's fill it"" etc)My front teeth are sensitive to cold Additionally I've always dreaded the flossing part which proves painful BUT BOTH visits to Briggs resulted in 100% pain-free cleanings They also offer laughing gas if anxiety is an issueI've seen both of the Briggs (Dr Roger and Dr Bradley) and was pleased with each - the apple doesn't fall far from the tree From the front desk to the tech to the doctors to the billing/checkout EVERY staff member was incredibly *sincerely* kind patient and extraordinary Both my husband and I have never experienced anything like it and being that my hubby is Jamaican (black) this says something especially in North Scottsdale where (sadly) there is racism Briggs Family Dentistry is reminiscent of businesses in a time past - something that is so rare so unseen now days  As long as this persists I can guarantee my hubby and I will be life-long patients  In fact today I scheduled for a crown I need and cavity filings for the hubbyA final note: the true mark of a great businessman is his involvement in the community and willingness to give back (pro bono work) the doctors Briggs are regularly involved in both locally and worldly  :-)."
1562,1,This is a great hotel and extremely pleased Stayed during a previous visit  though I am no rating it on hotel ranking convention the service and rooms are well worth the money.
1904,1,This is actually a review of their Phoenix location which recently opened in COFCO plaza  I've never been to any other location Their food/cakes/breads are simply amazing I honestly consider this new location a slice of baked heaven They are open until 7:30 the food is always fresh everything tastes wonderful and the recipes are always consistent I tried a sandwich a chicken wrap and a strawberry smoothie today All of them were beyond delicious  I'm a huge fan of their Hong Kong Milk Tea as wellTheir customer service is phenomenal The girl who is always working there is very sweet and remembers her customers I hope that it brings more business to the slowly dying COFCO plaza I'm sure the bakery inside Super L is pissed - and they should be They have some heavy competition ).
2104,1,It's the best Mexican food in the valley.
2453,1,We discovered this gem last spring in our travels  We hoped that it would still be here when we returned this winter  After unpacking our car we headed straight to the Lotus Garden and were elated to have our first Apache Junction meal there  We eat there at least once a week and bring all our guests there  The food is delicious and generous and is only overshadowed by the restaurant's hard-working friendly owners  We are thrilled that this place is open and apparently thriving  We wish the best to the beautiful family that has earned our business.

218,0,Didn't even get a chance to try their cookies or ice cream because of the horrendous smell that permeated throughout the store  My friend and I ate lunch at Crave across the street and decided to stop by Cookiez to get dessert  As soon as we opened the door the smell slapped us in the face  I felt we had entered a bathroom which hadn't been cleaned in months  My friend said it smelled like an old gym locker room  Needless to say we left without ordering.
3705,0,Just wanted to share my experience just in case you are thinking of hiring this firm Hiring maria Jones firm was a living nightmare The treatment I received not only by the paralegal but also the front office staff was beyond ridiculous My phone calls and emails were never answer not to mention that my file got put in the back burner for months it took bout a year before I could meet with whom was going to  be my attorney and the only reason she decided to talk to me its because I thread to  file a complaint with the bar of attorneys They did nothing with my file I was the one that call the NVC to follow up  all this people are unprofessional and inefficient and I have proof  of it  I could go on and on with everything that went wrong Needles to say I decided to fire them and go with a different firm They had to reimbursed some of my money back for which I had to wait 30 days due to their policy All I have to say do your homework check them out In my personal opinion this company only cares about their finances and not their clients So stay away from them if you want to save yourself a lot of headaches.
3276,0,"I thought I would try out this location after my previous auto shop had closed and hoped being that AAA recommended it it would provide good honest service  Had an oil change/maintenance check done there and was please with the service  But when I returned to have it looked at after the engine light went on their ""diagnostics"" test was going to cost $105  And that wouldn't have been waived if I had the service completed there  I had to passfree diagnostics test are available everywhere don't be suckered."

2353,1,"The words ""trust"" and ""auto mechanic"" rarely belong in the same sentence   Having owned many cars over the years I've experienced a very full range of mechanics  After driving by The Toy Box countless times my impression of it was that it was a boutique muscle car place  When a friend told me that he had all of his cars serviced there for years I was intrigued  I took my 2002 Tahoe in for an eval and Phil and his team were thorough and objective in their analysis and explanation  I liked that they weren't ""selling"" or pushy but really just matter of fact in giving me my options--- from keeping it running and stable to really fixing it up   Their rate is extremely competitive and they over-delivered on timing and service  If anything I think they need to work on their marketing as they're a real gem in a field of otherwise sketchy players."

4185,0,It's a shame to see so many awesome bands with shows at this Venue because no matter how great the band just the venue itself makes me not want to go see them  First off it is always ridiculously hot in this place I mean sweating here there everywhere so uncomfortable and unpleasant makes it really difficult to enjoy the show when you're standing there constantly fanning yourself and wiping sweat off your face  Secondly we waited almost an hour to just get through the doors even though we already had tickets  They need to come up with a better system they had ONE line only and ONE entrance for advanced tickets will call people who are buying at the door etc which was extremely inconvenient  You would think that they would have a line for will call a separate line for ticket holders at least The night we went the place was packed and there was only ONE bar and two bartenders and they were at MAX Capacity  Also the little gap that separated the 21+ was also the only way to get to the restrooms which was not to mention blocked by the ridiculous bar crowd waiting to get drinks  Over all I would not recommend coming to this venue for shows by far the worst experience  No matter how good the show was I still walked out saying this sucked because the venue sucked Saw two shows there and will probably not go back.

3778,0,The hours say they are open until 10pm Tuesday through Thursday but they activated their after hours answering message at 9:30pmLittle Chicago apparently hires staff that likes to close up early Makes me suspicious of how much care they put into their pizza.
158,1,Great Middle Eastern food  I used to eat there with some friends from Turkey and they all agreed that this was one of the best places in the ValleyI am huge fan of Kafta and theirs is one of the best I have had  The portions are huge and everything from the meat to the rice to the sauces are great  The lentil soup is also a nice touch.
2744,1,I love how friendly the staff is at Woof They always do a great job cutting my dogs long shaggy hair and she smells so good for the next couple of days A very clean cute place.
4650,0,I hadn't been to Buca Di Beppo in a few years and I won't be going back for at least a few more (until the memories of my experience fade at least) First of all it's incredibly expensive I understand it's meant to be served family style but my fiancee and I ordered a single dish and had a coupon for another free one a small order of garlic bread and two waters Our bill: $32 - for ONE dish and garlic bread It's ridiculousSecond the service was terrible 30 minutes after we were seated we finally had the chance to order This isn't to say the waitress didn't come to the table she did It's just that when she did she was in such a hurry that all we could eek out before she was rushing away was that we wanted two waters We were there for an hour and a half for spagetti I will just make this at home from now onThird the way the restaurant is laid out it's VERY loud There was a party of about 10 people next to us and my fiancee and I couldn't even hear each other talk So we say in silence Now this is not the restaurants fault but these people were OBNOXIOUS The management should have said something And finally the food is terrible It reminded me of food made at summer camp - you know what I'm talking about - the mass produced kind with standard pasta and sauce My fiancee also noted that his chicken parmigiana was terrible and that it's better at Olive Garden A restaurant I will be sticking with from here on out :).
2042,1,Great place - friendly staff great live music love the couscous & chicken I keep saying I'm going to try something else but then I know I'll miss this tasty dish Best to order it & share w someone who orders a pizza Such a gem Love it.
491,1,I first heard about Community Tire and Auto because of an award they received from ASU WP Carey School of Business Although this location wasn't ideally convenient in terms of distance from my home I decided to try them Once I did which was several years ago I've never taken my vehicle anywhere else for the services they offer The big thing in my experience with Community Tire and Auto has been a sense of honesty and integritywhich are not qualities always associated with auto repair and maintenance shops In looking back I realized that there were at least 2-3 instances with my prior provider of choice (Sun Devil Auto) where I felt pressured to make repairs or conduct maintenance that was questionable and I should have gotten a second opinion Altogether the cost for those visits ran into the thousands of dollars  I have never felt that with Community Tire The pricing is fair They refer to manufacturer's guidelines for all maintenance recommendations And they occasionally have coupons which are always nice including a free oil change with your birthday I almost feel like Community Tire and Auto's service is a secret that needs to be shared so others can experience the peace of mind I have since discovering them myself.
1190,1,our  server kira was  awesome  great  vibe  awesome &  creative  foods  and  great  wines definitely  coming  back.
3339,0,EW That about captures it We were so excited to see a new Fox Restaurant Concept open up in town Also we are HUGE oyster and seafood fans and that's why we were so curious about this restaurant -- especially when they have a huge oyster area up front and state they ship the oysters in fresh every day However there is NO WAY these oysters were fresh They had a mushy/creamy consistency that made it impossible to want to finish them We also tried the shrimp cocktail and jar of crab appetizers Neither one of these were disgusting but they weren't good The shrimp cocktail from Costco is much better than this one was and cheaper The crab was over cooked and extremely pricey for the quality and amount you receive This place is expensive to try and not worth it My advice is skip Little Cleo's and try a different Fox Restaurant Concept instead.
3850,0,"I have been here for dim sum couple times good service and good food BUT a recent visit to Phoenix Palace gave me a brand new view about this place My friend and I had 2 waters and 6 dim sum items When the bill came we noticed an item on the bill says ""2 guests: $170"" When we asked the server why she replied ""we charge money for water""  This restaurant CHARGES $085 for every water they give out to customer This is not bottle water simply water from the tap in a plastic cup For this reason I will NOT return to this place there are plenty other dim sum places in town will gladly provide free water to customers like any other restaurant in AZ."
2360,1,Whoa Gave this place 3 stars last time due to hiccups in service (it was their first week or so in business) But after a visit for dinner today with my family I had to update it to 5 stars The service was absolutely above and beyond Our server was quick and helpful The entire staff was so kind to my baby nephew who had a few crying bouts The staff came out with a bowl of ice cream to help calm him down and even gave him a piece of bacon on the way outAnd of course once again the food was incredible Every single person in our party ordered something unique off the menu and loved it.
1769,1,WOW I'm so glad we found an awesome Chinese food place I was so tired of all the other dirty slow bad food places The food is delicious and they give you a lot Every time I order I have lunch and a snack for the next day The prices are really good too You will not find any other place that offers this amazing food at a great price Give up your search and step in here or order for pickup/delivery You won't regret it.
3521,0,"I was really excited to try this restaurant and tonight my husband and I came and ordered food to take-out The service was very friendly and the store was clean cute and colorfulbut the food was very disappointing My husband ordered the curry chicken and although it tasted okay he literally almost choked on tiny bones in the meat 4 or 5 times I asked ahead of time if they used white meat and was told yes but the ""Calypso Pasta"" I ordered had tiny tiny pieces of dark meat jerk chickeninstead of the boneless white strips I was expecting and really it was just mediocre I'm bummed I wanted to like this place."
4907,0,"Sorry Mark I have to mostly disagree with you on this one I do agree that they have great dogs so maybe that's why they don't actually want to adopt them and I hate to be down on an organization who is trying to do a good thing butA couple a weeks ago a friend who volunteers for the rescue had taken one of the dogs out of the kennel he is staying in and brought him to the Fat Tire Festival at Tempe Town Lake I fell in love with the little guy his name is Jalen and called my fiance to see if he'd come meet him too He did he loved him so we decided to see if we could adopt him After filling out the online application (the only way to put in an application) which took over an hour we waited the three business days they gave as the time frame that it could take to get back to us Three days passed nothing so I called and emailed them to see if they even received the application no response So I asked my friend to find out next time he went to volunteer if they had gotten it  They told him that the website must be broken because they did not receive it so I asked him to see if they got the email or voicemail NO Okaaaay what the hell Well my volunteer friend brought over Jalen to our house to meet our other dogs and cat to see if he would even fit in here They all got along just fine Seriously they all got along even with the catRobert calls me later when he gets back to the rescue and says they found my application but they still didn't call me back So we emailed them and called AGAIN Finally one and a half weeks after we filled out the online application  a woman calls me with a list of excuses of why Jalen would not be a good fit She told me that the cat is a concern that the dog is terrified of cats (even though it says on his description on their website ""We haven't found anyone Jalen doesn't get along with - cats dogs humans - he's just so mild-mannered"") I told her he met my cat and they were indifferent to each-other there were other excuses she had it was like she was reading them off a list Finally after being on the phone with her for a half an hour and it was obvious she didn't want to actually adopt the dog to anyone I told her I had to get back to work She then calls back ten minutes later saying that if we were okay with potty-training Jalen (apparently all of the other excuses she gave me were going to be disregarded now) that a volunteer could come over on Saturday morning to asses the situation We said absolutely see you then A senior volunteer (with the adopting powers)came over this morning everyone got along great Our pets are very loved and cared for But she had a problem with us keeping our dogs outside when it's nice out like today when we leave the house We don't think they should be crated up when it's so nice out our dogs like to be outside in our big backyard able to run around and lay in the grass/sun not in a little crate inside So she told us to keep the dogs inside when we leave the house for 30 days and see how that goes and then call them back and they would come back over to reassess and she took Jalen back to the kennel where he has been staying waiting for a good home Needless to say we were pretty disappointed that they didn't adopt to us and completely disenchanted with the organization We've adopted through a rescue before and didn't have any problems I'd try valleydogsorg or wwwakitaadvocatescom of you're looking for another rescue."
3171,0,I've eaten here before but only had the sushi  I went with a friend the other night and wasn't in the mood for sushi so i ordered off the menu  I ordered a chicken udon noodle dish  The wait time was not unreasonable nor the service up to the point that our food arrived  The chicken was not seasoned at all and tasted as though it had been pre-cooked and warmed up  The noodles were slimey and the dish was totally inedible  We flagged the waitress down and when I told her that I didn't like the dish and that the noodles were slimely  She informed me that they were supposed to be  She took the dish away and two minutes later someone that I assume to be the manager came over with the dish in his hand  He asked  me what the problem was and I explained to him that the chicken tasted like it had been precooked and warmed up and the noodles were slimely  He also informed me that the noodles were supposed to be that way  While he offered to get me something else he was not apologetic in the least and had a bit of an attitude  I ordered the stuffed mushrooms off the happy hour menu  They delivered two deep fried balls about the size of my fist  While they didn't taste old and slimely they were not good and they sat in a pool of soy sauce that  just made everything soggy and salty  The waitress did check back on us to see if we needed drinks but did not ask me about the food again and she seemed to carry on somewhat with the manager's attitude  My friends like the sushi and they do go there a lot  My suggestion if you do go here is that you stick with the sushi and stay away from the other menu items  When the bill came they had deducted a portion of the first dish from the check but had still charged me for a portion of it  It was not as if I'd eaten half of it and then sent it back  I barely took half a bite  I'll meet my friends for a beer and sake here but I will never eat here again.
953,0,Slow as fudgesicles.
1181,0,Definitely NOT Debra  She was not as helpful as I thought  Proofing was poor and though it took 3 times to get one of the cards redone several complained about the size of the font as the background of the invitation was dark  Spent a lot of money and should have been very satisfied  Several vendors were shown the invitation and agreed with me.
4197,0,This places STINKS And I mean that literally I've never smelt anything like it in my life  but what ever it is it forced me into being a mouth breather And finally I just had to get out .
1424,1,Forget the gross fry bread at the fair This place is amazing I probably gain 5 lbs everytime I eat here but it's totally worth it The green chili shredded beef is awesome Nice people very clean and somehow its inexpensive.
798,1,My favorite froyo place ever  They literally have the best tart yogurt I've ever had  I've been to Golden Spoon Yogurtland Redmango Icetangobut they do not compare to YB  They are really innovative with their ever changing flavors.

2209,1,"Where to start  I love this place  Every instructor I've had is fantastic they are all encouraging and patient  I feel like my form is corrected 15 times during some classes but it's always in a positive way   They somehow are VERY good at remembering names it's impressive  The fellow classmates are always friendly it really is just a great environment for self-improvement  Although I dare anyone to attend a few classes and NOT be tempted to go hit up Lululemon (or anything similar) for new gearThe studio itself is great  It's clean and open and inviting  There is an area for personal stuff in the back no locker room but a bathroom if you have to make a quick change after work before class  Most importantly the workout  It is tough  After my first class I was sore for a good four days but of course it's nice to know that your muscles exist  :)  Some days I feel like I'm a machine but Pure Barre always finds a way to bring me back to reality  My legs shake like I'm standing on a fault line and I'm pretty sure some day I will fall over I guess that's what the barre is for  Anyway I've been coming fairly consistently for almost two months and I have seen tremendous changes in myself  Every day after Pure Barre feels like a skinny day  My arm muscles and collarbone are starting to poke out I've lost inches in my waist and arms it's great to see actual progress  And since the class is just 55 minutes and is very fast-paced it's pretty easy to carve out time during the day to come to class  I certainly don't experience the same level of dread as I do with the ""regular"" gymIt is expensive but since I've been going there have been deals and promotions to ease up on price  At this point I'd rather pay for Pure Barre than continue to carry a gym membership to a place that I don't really like going   If you're on the fence give it a shot  It'll win you over."
4701,0,If you're like me you're reading reviews not to make a decision whether to visit but only to check in on poor old Chris-Town like you would an elderly relative  Sure enough most of the commenters grew up with Chris-Town and are at least a little saddened by this withered husk this pathetic atrociously-named sad sack of a former mall that is Phoenix SpectrumOh I remember the good times too  Chris-Town was probably the first mall I ever went to back when malls were a relatively new idea I suppose  (Come to think of it I probably saw some of my first movies at the old UA theater out front before it became a better place to watch gangbangers make out with their underage girlfriends)  I remember going to Dillard's with my grandmother hiding in the circular clothing racks running my hand along rows of impossibly silky blouses  I remember Santa Claus and the sand castles and the excellent pastrami at the Miracle Mile deli  I remember how it used to smell when the doors would whoosh open and you'd walk in out of the heat -- like a combination of clean tile floors and cool breeze and birthday cake  Miracle Mile beat its retreat long ago of course  The once-mighty Dillard's became Dillard's Outlet a gigantic disheveled storage shed for hundreds of piles of failed clothing which was picked over by masses of morbidly obese ThirstBuster-clutching vultures and then eventually went the way of the sand castles  And the smell  It's closer to gym socks fryer grease and despairAnd desperate is exactly how I would categorize most Chris-Town shoppers these days  The clientele along with the facade has aged disgracefully  This new sweaty mob of bargain hunters barges ahead blindly wielding their strollers like cow catchers each accompanied by an entourage of saggy-diapered Kool Aid-mouthed gremlins  Which is hardly a surprise: with Wal-Mart CostCo and more recently Super Target as its chief ballast it stands to reason that Chris-Town's main loyalty would be among those looking to spend as little as possible on the greatest possible quantity and there is plenty of that to be found in the poverty-line neighborhoods nearby It's senseless to compare as some have done Chris-Town with Scottsdale Fashion Square or even Metrocenter  Those are still malls  Chris-Town is just the bones of a giant -- a concisely depressing reminder that one can never go home again.
4805,0,I agree with Ricky C  was in Albertson's yesterday and also last week Pork was $349/lb not on sale today it was buy one get one free but the price was $699/lb now how is that buy one get one free  No store in the valley charges $699 for pork.
2993,1,I never knew Ice Cream could be so complexThrough my childhood I was always used to eating the ice cream basics I never knew of the possibilities Some of the flavors at Sweet Republic are a little out there but still amazingI have always been pretty open to trying new weird or interesting foods but ice cream was always supposed to be a safe bet Lucky for me I know that if you want to have fun in life you have to take risks And so I did The strangest flavors I tried at Sweet Republic I did not expect to be good at all I think the two most surprising were the Bacon and the Jalapeno Avacodo which were strangely deliciousMy very favorites were Mayan Chocolate and Peach which surprisingly tasted good togetherMy best memory at Sweet Republic was the eating contest which unfortunately I could not take part in because I'm allergic to bananas but watching was almost as funThe service here is great they are so friendly and helpful to people who are new to ice cream exploration You can really tell that they are passionate about what they do.
4837,0,I don't know why I continue to waste my time with this place - overpriced mediocre food and the most unfriendly staff in ArcadiaI guess I just want it to be good because of the location but I'm over itLast time I'm there we walk in and ask if we can watch the NBA Playoff game - the bar tender tells us he's rather watch the hockey so sorry  Pretty intense.
3360,0,"I went to one of the temporary ones to get our 2010 and 2011 taxes done (had issues using Turbo Tax to file last year)  So after being quoted ""around $200"" to do each return I decided OK let's try  My husband usually does it himself with Turbo Tax but since it had issues with the first-time homebuyer credit last year and kept returning the forms we decided to try a live person and we figured $400 wouldn't be too bad  Well after spending hours there because the guy was so slow typing everything in- he kept making mistakes that my husband and I corrected- we ended up with a $579 bill  Not sure how it happened- he said because we itemized etc  I don't know why we weren't quoted at a higher rate  I left there feeling upset cheated and like a fool  He tried to give us a $25 coupon like that would really make a difference  He seemed to understand that it was a lot of money he said it should be free since I'm a teacherblah blah who cares I still had to pay almost $600 right there that I was not expecting to pay We will NEVER use a tax service again  I don't care how desperate I am to get my taxes done  I will trust my husband to do Turbo Tax or whatever and if we miss out on something fine  At last I know I didn't pay some guy more than $100 an hour to type numbers into a computer  What a waste."
1059,1,I'm visiting from LA so this was the first time I have eaten at Best Of Philly I will for sure eat there next trip The Gyros was amazing And the mushroom steak sub was too die for Thanks to the nice people working I think it was the owner and maybe his wife.
886,1,I have been looking for a good Jamaican restaurant for a long time specifically one that has beef patties and home made sorrel  I used to live in New York and they were easy to find there but not in AZ I found this restaurant on Yelp last weekend and decided to take the whole family after looking at the menu online It was a Monday so we were able to get the jerk chicken plate for $5 for the lunch special My husband loved the chicken and so did my 5 year old It had just the right amount of spice My 2 year old loved the rice and peas I was very excited that they had home made sorrel as it wasn't listed on the online menu It was amazing I ordered a beef patty and a chicken patty both were good but the chicken patty was definitely better The staff is extremely friendly and made sure to give us coupons for the next time we come back I am now recommending this restaurant to anyone I know that enjoys Jamaican food Get up and go You won't be disappointed.
3305,0,Is it wrong for buffets to make you more dispondant/angry as you eatI've only had to leave in the middle of a buffet one time before I was full becaues of seriously bad food and this was number 2 The food was practically flavourless - the Honey chicken tasted as though they took Spaghetti-O sauce and some sugar mixed in and called it a sauce so much other food was completely void of any flavour The only halfway decent food was the chow meinEven the service was lacking - no one asked how the food was or if there was anything I needed The cashier barely muttered the amount I was due and that was itYou're much better off at other places.
1154,1,"I love Nielsen's Both locations are very nice The food is good quality and the employees seem very efficient and industrious I love the ""Finer Things"" sandwichAn aside (which does not affect my rating): Many of the people here don't control their children - almost every time I have gone to either Nielsen's there are kids going crazy It's worth it for the food though."
1568,1,After a bad experience at our Favorite Restaurant Roca Akor in Scottsdale we turned to Yelp and Roka's very capable manager Charles responded within an hour invited us back and more than made it right  We knew they had great food and now thanks to Charles we know they have great management  We highly recommend it.
3353,0,It truly pains me to have to write this review of what I would otherwise consider an excellent establishment but recent events prevent me from recommending this restaurant to anyoneYes this may be a bit of a rant so in an attempt to be balanced let me offer a little perspectivePizzeria Bianco was one of the first places that I ate at when I moved to Phoenix earlier this year The food is very good The service is good but I was immediately aware that the business model is very flawed in that I have never waited for less than 90 minutes for a table It is true that you can pass the time quickly in the adjacent wine bar and I have done so on many occasions The wine selection is above average and the environment is pleasantHowever the business manager (owner Chris Bianco's ex-wife) is a truly miserable human being (ask any of her employees) and her imprint on the approach to customer service at the restaurant is unmistakable The management believes that there is absolutely no incentive to provide anything resembling an enjoyable experience for their patrons because there are unlimited numbers of people who will wait upwards of 4 hours for their signature wood-fired pizzasAs a fan of excellent food I do appreciate their attention to detail and excellent craft But the consistent manner in which I see loyal customers disrespected and outright abused is completely unacceptableWhile I do love their pizza and antipasto (which is not irreplaceable I might add) after many months of consistent patronage I cannot recommend this restaurant to anyone.
3611,0,"I would give this place 0 stars if I couldWe went on a saturday afternoon for a quick bite We walked into the bar where we were the only people on sitting on high tops Our server came in and asked us what we wanted to drink we put in our food order at the same time At 10 mins in people are sitting down and ordering Our server is bringing out food left and right he tells us our food ""will be right out"" About 25 minutes later several people are now sitting at the bar high tops and some of them are eating and a couple of guys who sat down after us were already finished with their meal We call our server over and tell him that people who sat down after are already finished with their meal he says ""Oh don't worry your food will be right out"" An indication that he was clearly incompetent was when he put in a food order after ours and is  bringing it out before ours We tell him that we would need our food to to go because we had places to be About 10 minutes later the manager comes out (with no food in hand) and says that they must have lost our ticket in the back and he will go back there and see what's going on At this point we can't tolerate anymore incompetence so we leave hungry after waiting over 45 mins This location is the worst service I've experienced Even a hefty gift card couldn't make up for this awful experience."
4272,0,OkSo here's the deal You know a place is bad when I feel compelled to share my bad experience with the world  I feel horrible doing this but I mean come on Not only was the food some of the worst I've ever had (and I have had really bad food)  But what got me more then the horrible food was the service  I sat outside for 15 minutes before I went in to get someone Than It took another 10 for her to come out  All the while I had a server that was sitting down talking to a table  The food was cold service was slow and it was not worth the money  I vow to never go there again There are so many other great places at Tempe Market Place.
2009,1,"So Yelp is so solid an' rarely lies on stuff it's so great I moved to Phoenix in the recent past and of course needed a new ""go to barber"" I am MUCH MORE particular than the average guy I guess when it comes to haircuts so I think that should say a lot for those who aren't and need a solid cutTHe first time I went I decided to go with Arsen(he cuts hair at the end furthest from the door) Not only was he good and has never disappointed since I been back but he is even known for cutting a fair amount of famous peoples hair Especially around Spring Training when all the ball players are around (GO GIANTS) =)Anyway if you want a guy who will fade your hair perfectly do exactly what you want AND even suggest ideas as well Arsen and Scottsdale Barber Shop is your place."

2833,1,Top notch company We were so impressed the first time we have called them three more times to come and complete small jobs: install/move ceiling fans install flush-mount ceiling lights and switches disconnect and patch old junction boxes and install new outdoor power sockets They ALWAYS arrived on time were quick well priced and even vacuumed up their mess before leaving All of their staff was nice courteous and helpful I even emailed the owner for some do-it-yourself advice and he was prompt in returning my email even calling me on the phone to tell me what to do I would highly recommend these guys.

3475,0,Been here twice The first time the waitress spilled food on me and with no apology I returned again another time just to appease my daughters Again the waitress( a different one) was short with us and obviously in too much of a hurry to attend to our needs But my real gripe was the glasses They were filthy All of them I couldn't use them they just put me off The inside of the glasses had this build up of grime and dirt on them  I won't be going to this place again.
3327,0,Poorly organized dirty and crappy selection of everything Not really much redeeming about this store Sad even for a Walmart.

2866,1,My family and I have been eating here for years  It is a very unassuming restaurant in a strip mall location  The food is always consistently great and the salad you get with your entree is the best  Also the garlic bread is amazing  Some of the dishes I have had the pleasure of inhaling here are the lasagne chicken saltinboka fetachini alfredo linguini carbonara linguini and clam sauce sausage and peppers oh I could go on and on  Also they have a small bar which is dark and relaxing.

1906,0,Let me start by saying this is not a one-off review  I have been going to this place for years and it was very good (Not the best but good) This morning my wife and I took a trip over for my fav menu item Machaca breakfast burrito with potato  I've had this many times in the past but OMG  I could not even finish it  It tasted like old used fryer grease and did not even have an egg in it  How do you call it breakfast without an egg   Just mushy mashed potatoes with a tiny bit of hamburger in it  (Yes burger Not even real roast beef)  Worse yet the portion size had reduced to 1/3its normal size (barely 3 bites of filling) and was still wrapped in the usual giant tortilla  Anyone that has been here before knows how good those are  Er Used to be  The tortilla had the same used grease taste as the rest  My wife had the chicken taco and even it had suffered major changes and used grease taste  (How do you mess up a taco) I am so sad and will be reluctant to return anytime soon Beware this place may be on the way out.

143,1,Ok  I have to admit first that I have been a HUGE fan of In N Out burger for years  then I stopped into Freddy's one day and haven't gone to In N Out since  The service is great the food is AMAZINGLY good and the atmosphere is fun and fresh  You will not be disappointed  I do the California Double Combo  give them a try.
154,1,The Keg was the best dining experience my date and I have had in a very long time We had been here a few times before but the service was out of this world this time I had the Alaskan crab legs with garlic mashed potatoes and my date the New York strip and twice baked potato His was cooked exactly how he likes and my crab legs were perfection Our server Tyler was knowledgable about wine suggestions and was a pleasure to chat with Ashley the manager was great as well and seemed to genuinely care about our experience We will be back many times in the future.
151,1,Mr Flores was very helpful and knowledgeable  I need also found him to be very honest  His price was lower than everybody else for a Trane 14 SEER unit  I would definitely recommend him.
4244,0,I had the Pollo Diablo formerly named Pollo Magnifico  They renamed it because they added more cream cheese so calling it Diablo would give it that extra edge  Apparently this burro wasn't enough of an artery clogger just yet  I didn't know what to get so I decided to get what the Yelp review highlights recommended  Unfortunately it is not always clear if those highlights are for a positive or negative review of the dish My quick scan indicated that Pollo Magnifico/Diablo was a good thing so I went with that  Pollo Diablo is a deep-fried chicken burro drowning in jalapeno cream and cheese served with a side of beans and rice  I took one look at the thing and felt myself getting full and bloated already  The fried touch made it not quite crispy just a little greasy  The inside was tender but hard to really pay attention to with all of the jalapeno cream and cheddar cheese everywhere I was overwhelmed and ate less than half the entree  Nothing worth taking with me eitherThe worst part about eating here is that we all just got tired from eating  They are big heavy portions  I looked over at my cousin and his head was propped up in his hands his eyes drooping  My sister's tamale was basically a hunk of really heavy and dry cornbread and she was exhausted from eating too  This was heavy stuffI'm not from the Southwest so maybe I just don't know any better but for this California girl I would much rather  eat Mexican food in a dirty hole in the wall in San Jose than to come back here.
1768,1,We ate there because of the good reviews on yelp and were not disappointed  The chip and salsa were fresh and crisp  My cheese enchilada & tamale with rice and beans were perfect   Staff was friendly enjoyable to be there  We try a different Mexican food restaurant every Thursday night for the past nine months and we love this place.
1846,1,This ain't your daddy's hot dog cart No sirree Bob if you're looking for Vienna franks boiled in dirty water steamed buns and French's mustard you may want to keep drivingHowever if you're looking for a gourmet experience where loving care is paid to  every dog they cook then this is your place Hot dogs with gouda cheese bacon and even peanut butter as toppings I had the bacon-wrapped bockwurst with german potato salad and it was delicious Even the kids dogs with basic ketchup and mustard are wrapped in a pita rather than a bun and my boys really enjoyed themAdditionally at least at the Central and Camelback location they have a firepit and sell Smores kits which made my boys very happy and will be enjoyed by adults as wellFinally the service was great Despite the crowds service was friendly attentive and very prompt - which is something you don't always find at food trucksShort Leash Dogs - we will be back.
196,0,I really wanted to love this because I am a downtown resident who loves to eat out but I'm sad to say I won't go here again for dining  I left feeling that I had just spent $15 on a small bowl of spaghetti-o's and the packaged stale breadsticks also left a lot to be desiredI hope the powers-that-be at PastaBAR will note the negative reviews and re-work the menu because the location and decor are amazing.
4815,0,Don't ever eat here We walked in Saturday morning There were about 10 tables open on the patio We told hostess we wanted to sit outside and she said 15 minutes  Why I have no idea except she was trying to load up her friends section instead of seating open tables  Told her to piss off and we went to IHOP across the street Sat immediately and awesome food.
4989,0,"Good food but horrible stuffy and pretentious atmosphere  Showed up for late lunch & was greeted by a completely self-absorbed young girl who has clearly never received training in customer service  The place was nearly empty and she asked (with a bored blank stare) if we had a reservation  When we said no she huffed and acted very put off  Once we were seated the service was so terrible that we left before eating our meal  Have dined here multiple times  Just cannot take the poor service and generally stuffy ""wealthy grandmother"" like atmosphere any longer."
419,1,Garlic stir fry with pork (medium or hot) is delicious Comes with steamed white rice and that's all you really need Get it to go and it comes in a bowl that you can dump the rice into and mix it all up One tasty tasty dinner here my friendsFriends have had the pad see ew with chicken and once with beef Pretty tasty A little sweeter than I personally would want it but the meat and noodles are cooked wellHad the Thai Toast Not a huge fan But I have never had it before so I have nothing to compare it to Just tasted a bit oily to me Deep fried a bit too much.
1636,1,I have been to this place 2 times in the past few years when visiting AZ And both times was amazingThe service and the food is Amazing The Texas Rose is super yummy The Ribeye was cooked to perfectionI wish there was a Lone Star in the California Bay Area.
4340,0,This is the worst frozen yogurt place I've ever been toFirst when I first went last summer they were pretty new  I thought that was why it was so plain inside  They also didn't have much to offer  The frozen yogurt was too tart and then only offered 2 or 3 flavors--none of which I liked  There was a plain flavor (ick) mango and maybe peach or something else strange  And they put the toppings on themselves  They barely put anything on there  Definitely not worth the costOh  And because they were new their website was pretty plain and boring  However I must add that it had soooo many grammatical errors  So unprofessional  And I see now that their website has nothing on it  How can you have a business in 2009 and not have a websiteI've been in since then and it still is just as bad as then  The yogurt is disgusting and I would never go here again  It's disappointing because I don't have any other frozen yogurt places near my house.

3873,0,"OK We've been here before and the service was good the food was good but not the comfort food seafood that We have yet to find since Fosters closed it's doorsWe ate at Wildfish last night and what a nightmare No special occasion we are just dieting and go out once a week for a really good meal We were seated promptly as we had a reservation but I had to make an 8:30 reservation and when we arrived the place had a lot of empty space so I think we could have come soonerOur server was a nice guy he brought us our drinks and with his good description of the Lobster dish sold me on it After about 20 min wait he finally came back and took our order Both Entrees we wanted were out so we had do decide on something else OK it was late so I can understand thatHe notified us that there was only one serving of the Chilean Sea Bass So I asked for that He ran to the kitchen to reserve that then promptly came back for our order They serve it two ways Roasted with a lemon sauce and Hong Kong Soy Style I ordered it Roasted My wife ordered crab stuffed shrimp and we ordered a side of Asparagus After our Bisque about 30 min later out came the Sea Bass incorrectly prepared HK style and the stuffed shrimp I told the food runner that it was the wrong dish he said OK I'll fix that I asked how they can fix it if that was the last sea bass they hadThe Manager came out and apologized Apparently they had more ""in the back"" What does that really mean anyway It all comes from ""the back"" He was really a nice guy 5 min later the food came out and the bass was correct but my wife's entree was not really very hot They should have left it for her to start They also brought the wrong side ReallyDon't get me wrong the food was really good and I think the service snafu was just a comedy of errors the Manager came out again and comp'd a very large portion of our meal He really handled it as best he could but what prompted me to write this is that a very similar mixup happened at the table next to us They had the misfortune of having the most obnoxious loud talking server in the place They had to re-order stuff that they were out of Also he played off bringing out the wrong steak as a good thing ReallyBad service really kills an otherwise good restaurant we have seen some with good food but bad service close their doors (Metro Brasserie for instance) so I write this in hopes the wait staff of the world will pay attention and at least take this advice: WRITE EVERYTHING DOWN at the table and pay attention to detail."
3622,0,Don't come here if you have curly hair The hairdresser I had didn't have a clue how to cut it For example she used a razor (which you're definitely supposed to do with curly hair) To be fair she is getting her real estate license Hopefully she leaves hair cutting soon and never returns  And let's all hope she is better at selling houses.

4308,0,"I have been a patron of Eggingtons for over 20 years I have nothing bad to say about the food itself it's amazing and wonderful and I'll still come back despite this review However that being said a patron who has been coming for 20+ years should have been treated in a much more professional manner I made a reservation 2 MONTHS in advance of the Saturday before mother's day to have a Bridal Shower Bruncheon for my Sister-in-law Yes it was a large party yes it was the Saturday BEFORE Mother's Dayall of which was irrelevant because if this was going to be a problem you should NOT have taken the reservation for me in the first place Most restaurants I go to that I've made reservations for usually have the table ready for me when I get there which I assumed would be the case as I had requested it be ready a few moments ahead of 11:30 so I could set up the cupcakes games etc I arrived at 10:55 to be sure that everything was in place and to drop off the cupcakes so they wouldn't melt The hostess took the cupcakes and my name and said the table wasn't ready yet so I went to run a last minute errand and came back at 11:20 To my chagrin not only was my table STILL not ready another party was still occupying it which I was told only after waiting for another 10 minutes with balloons favors and gifts in the lobby when I finally went up and asked what had happened with the reservation  The hostess basically had no response other than that it ""wasn't quite 11:30 yet"" and that the bills were being taken up I glanced over to where she had just looked and saw that the people were literally still eating Another party of 15 people were not even close to being done so it was close to noon before we were seated  After finally getting settled there were no further issues but it just wasn't what I'd had in my mind I'd wanted everything all set up and pretty for everyone's arrival and there was no apology for the miscommunication on Eggington's sideIt may not sound like it from this review but I'm actually a pretty reasonable person If something like this happens I get it it's an accident but don't make me stand there with a group of 15 people and feel like the dummy when it wasn't my fault either Bring out some muffins find another place to move us out of the way continue to apologize for the mistake and bring me some free whatever-the-bride-to-be's-favorite-drinks are (raspberry mochas) when we're finally seated It's really a lot easier to alleviate these issues than it seems unfortunately management doesn't seem to take this approach the majority of the time."
284,0,Not a good experience on my trip to AZ  I was in Scottsdale for a meeting and we made a reservation the day before for 35 people  Once we arrived we had a total of 2 servers (for 35 people)  The food I ordered was OK at best and served cold but due to all the other issues going on I decided to eat it rather then send it back and get back something worse Very slow service from the servers overall and when trying to leave and pay we couldn't get a check it was so slow that some of our party just threw cash on the table and left  We finally had to form a line by the cash register to pay our check The staff was overwhelmed most of the time and started to have attitudes with us they seemed to forget who the customer wasWe were not asking for anything outside the ordinary No owner owner on site also were told no managerso there was no one available to fix the problems we had  We waited for over an hour for our checks I would never recommend this restaurant to anyoneEVERwe even told our hotel and entire staff NEVER to send anyone to this restaurant.
1873,1,I had been waiting with great anticipation for Five Guys to open when I first read the news last year  Five guys is one of the few things I missed about living in Virginia and my first meal there on the day they opened was totally worth the wait  Some points to consider: They aren't cheap They aren't fancy or foo-foo  They only serve a few things  But everything they serve is fantastic and well worth the price  For those complaining about the burger being too big get the little version For those complaining about it being unhealthy go buy a salad elsewhere For those complaining about it being expensive consider the sheer volume of food you're getting for the money  They don't nickel and dime you with extra toppings or add-ons you pay one price and get anything you want and enough to split between two people if you're not able to take it down yourselfThese folks are spreading the dream folks.

4524,0,I like Panda Express food but over the last few years their servings have gotten too small We used to get the Panda Feast I say used to because we quit going there all together They used to fill those qt containers until they could barely get them closed now they fill the containers a little over 3/4 full but charg full price This just wasn't happening with one particular server but all of them so I think maybe their managers are telling them to under fill containers I don't know that for sure but what I do know is that I am not particularly fond of getting ripped off so to avoid getting burned we just don't go there anymore.
1637,1,"I was visiting the Scottsdale Gun Club recently and decided to grab lunch afterwards I ended up going to ""Pasta-N-More"" because it looked like a delicious local small business the type of place I love to support The outgoing owner instantly welcomed me into the restaurant and his staff all treated me like a member of the family I knew from the first moment when I walked in that I had found a new favorite weekly spot to get lunch The prices were reasonable and the menu was massive I tried two items because I couldn't make up my mind the sausage roll and the meatball sliders The sausage roll was amazing think of it like a new twist on the traditional calzone The meatball sliders were equally mind-blowing truly one of the best ideas I have ever heard of If you like meatballs or sliders you have got to try these This place is one of the cleanest and friendliest small businesses I have been to in a very long time I was honestly surprised to see how clean the tables and soda machines were This is not common in restaurants these days No one takes the time to do this anymore and it drives me crazy This place will put any ""supposedly"" clean restaurant and soda fountain to shame I guarantee it This is one of my big pet peeves and I always make a point to check the machines and tables out Take a look for yourself and order some sliders while your there."
874,1,I have been a fan of Frost since they opened their second store in Tucson near Sabino Canyon I don't think there is a better Gelato place ever And I mean Ever I was so desperate to find out when they were opening one in Phoenix that I actually emailed them They promptly informed me that they DO have a Frost open now and its in Gilbert Umm Yeah that's only a 25 minute drive for me from Ahwatukee but hey who cares At least I don't have to drive allll the way to Tucson to get my Gelato fix Not that I mindbut anywayso here we goand have been 3 times in the last 4 weeks Do I even have to tell you how amazing this place is The more times we go the more people are standing in line to get a piece of this heaven I love the fact that they go around and serve water as you are experiencing your gelato Makes it go down much better I think The girls and guys that work there are phenomenal actually look you in the eye when greeting and talking to you and always have a smile on their face Why wouldn't they they are selling happiness :).

2808,1,"Knowledgable bartender excellent food selections   Burgers are FANTASTIC  We went in late evening  Being a person that simply loves great food I tend to have the bartender waiter or waitress guide me on what to order  I have passed this place for years and years always had a curiosity to go in there  I loved the amibiance was crisp clean small but very well done  TV's lined the bar for sports and each booth is lined up against the wall so the TV screens are also in view of each person in the place  The female bartender was amazingly knowledgeable and led us down the right path  We orderd the wonderful asparagus with goat cheese the WINGS were absolutely delcious with no single flavor that overpowered another very good non-traditiona wings  The sweet and spicy burger was amazingly tasty but again excellent blend of flavors nothing too strong very creative  The peppercorn burger was also excellent however the cheeseburger was rather uneventful but it's also a 'cheeseburger"" with no added love  We left this place 100 percent satisfied and excited for the next taste test  If you look at all of my reviews I most always stop short of giving 5 stars it was without a doubt on this one that give 5 stars   I love great tasting food doesn't have to be big portions or pretty just has to be tasty and thats what I found  I simply don't 'get the burger hype of Deluxe Modern Burger or Zin Burger the burgers here are much better and around the same price."
394,0,Purchased the Groupon for the tri-pak of oils which they were out of  Was told they would arrive in 15 minutes waited 20 minutes and left  Waste of a trip guess they couldn't come up with a solution to give me another product to subsitute what they didn't have  Ruined my experience to ever go there again.
1643,1,Breakfast burrito's are pretty much my favorite food in the whole world Fiesta's Country Burrito definitely contributes to this Fresh tortilla eggs potatoes cheese - add refried beans and their amazing green salsa it's a beautiful thing really   Plus they have the best Dr Pepper ever the perfect mix of carbonation and syrup It's also friendly cheap fast and a three minute drive from my house LOVE.
4099,0,"Where to start - how about the over hour wait for my appointment with no reason as to why and then when asked why and when I would get in - I was told just a few more minutes At this point I called my husband who had an appointment after mine and said come down I am giving you my appointment so we are not here all day So my 10 am appointment for a routine cleaning became his appointment for the same thing and he was called in at 11:20 - this in essence my appointment was almost an hour and a half late I am sitting there waiting for my husband thinking he is getting his x-rays and cleaning when I get a text from him saying only 15 min more and I get to see the dentist Silly me - I am thinking his x-rays and cleaning are done He finally comes out over an hour later (mind you it would only be 15 min to see the dentist) and tells me that he has to come back next week for the cleaning What He sat there for over an hour just to get x-ray's Then when told he'd see the dentist in 15 min it was over 45 min So my husband was in their chair for over two hours and all he had done was x-rays and about 20 min with the dentist trying to tell him he needed a crown replaced (that did not need replacing) and that he had two cavities that the dentist never did show him on the x-ray Mind you when he was at the dentist (his original before we moved to Arizona) everything was fine At this point neither of us are happy - I rescheduled my ""cleaning"" for the very first appointment on a Sat so we would not have to wait an hour and a half again for an appointment I was not happy at all with the service and asked for the office manager to call me Monday morning I was told no problem On Tues afternoon I called and was told oh she is not here today and has left for CA for a corporate meeting - never did tell me why she did not call me on Monday I then proceed to call the corporate officee to voice my concerns They tell me that they have had complaints because of the wait times and lack of communication with patients and she was not surprised She in turned called the Glendale AZ office and told them that they were to make sure that both my husband and I were in and out on time for our appointments and all that was to be done was a cleaning So - here we are - my husband has an appointment today (Sat) to do his cleaning He gets a message telling him that he has to come in early to do a ""service-plan"" and his cleaning would cost him $180 because they only do deep cleanings and his insurance does not pay for deep cleanings I call them back and ask to talk to the office manager (she left the mess) I explain that I am not happy we are not paying $180 and there will be no ""service plan"" - I get hung up because I am told that I am not talking nice Really - I call back - I tell the person on the phone that I want to speak to the office manager again - she tells me that the office manager wants me to come in and discuss this with her I tell the receptionist that I am sorry if I sound angry with you it is not your fault but you do not want me in your office right now as your patients probably do not want to hear what I have to sayImagine my surprise when the office manager gets on the phone and tells me that I just threatened her employee mumbles something and hangs up on me Also keep in mind not only did I tell them but corporate told them that they needed to call me not my husband as he is very hard to reach and I can get ahold of him and have him call them if necessary - and they keep calling him not me and he cannot return calls or answer his phone while he is working In addition - their reception area is awful dirty (my husband likens it to a free clinic in a third world country) and not very invitingBelieve me when I say that corporate is getting a call first thing Monday which will probably do no good and I am posting this everywhere I can - it joins the other 30+ or so bad reviews that I have read about Western Dental Do not risk your teeth money or health from what I read and go to Western Dental."

1300,0,Been going to 6 since it opened Always gave it thumbs up because it was always classy and you meet some cool people in there Especially during the weekBUT in the last year or so it has taken a nose dive Yeah sure it packed with the  population growth this area has seen in the last 5 years any club in the Stetson rd area will be packedThe lighting in there sucks it's so hard to see who you are talking to The DJ's typically play the same stuff all the other clubs do so it basically the flavor of the month I like clubs who have balls to play something totally different If something changes soon they may hold their good rating but for now I got to go low.
1219,1,Defining things in the negative is dangerous but in this case a little negative-definition is necessary: TMI isn't a fake dive bar frequented by white kids pretending to be poor it isn't a fake (insert European nationality here) pub it isn't trying to serve over-priced small plates it doesn't have super sexy low lighting or uncomfortable chairsIt is a low-key house-turned bar that serves solid food executed extremely well alongside beer and wine that has obviously been selected with care by fans of things that taste goodThe sandwiches here are really a reminder about how good a sandwich can be flirting with the platonic ideal in sandwich-ness  The mac n' cheese is just like mom made it baked and crusty and rich  The salads are simple and deliciousHappy hour is really generous - $250 draught beers and $4 selected glasses of wine  The tap beer selection is better than anywhere else in downtown Phoenix excepting the Roosevelt which is very un-hang-outable  I've sipped three or four glasses of other people's wines and the wine selection is really great as wellBest of all kind of like Casey Moore's in Tempe the bar is starting to act as a great place to see the diversity of folks who live in the Coronado and Roosevelt neighborhoods.

961,0,Booked an appointment at Northlight Counseling a month ago had my husband take the kids to preschool arranged to be late to work and navigated crazy Phoenix traffic for 60 minutes during rush hour only to have them tell me they made a mistake and didn't have me on their schedule Now they can't get me in for another month Ugh I don't think I will be going back They did apologize but I will not risk having this happen again  It's too bad because I had heard good things about Dr Hicks.
3896,0,"Ugh We absolutely hated our experience here When we first arrived the host (who was standing outside at a stand) called us ""sir"" and ""madam"" which I thought was a little peculiar but not in and of itself annoying Little did I know that ~32 minutes later we'd look back and think of his misplaced etiquette as the only positive thing about our dining experience at Dragonfly The service was totally unimpressive especially given that the restaurant wasn't at all crowded and the $4 happy-hour-special Long Islands were more sour mix than alcohol but what really turned us off was the overly sweet sugary and poorly-thought-out food We started with the ""Mill Avenue"" appetizer sampler The only real standout was the cream-cheese filled puffs (ironically the least authentic item) - the other items including the sauce were just off The spare ribs were dry the paper wrapped around the spring rolls was tough (telltale sign that they hadn't been freshly made) and the sauces were watery and had no zest at all We eagerly looked forward to our entrees but when they came and we tried them we found ourselves wishing for the flavorless and subpar - but not disgusting - appetizers My husband had the mango beef - I used to work at a Vietnamese fusion restaurant where this was featured on the menu and there it consisted of thinly sliced beef with tender pieces of mango and a oyster sauce Here it was fatty chunks of beef with underripe mango in a sickeningly sweet sticky sauce mixed up with a bunch of unrelated ""sauteed"" veggies My yellow curry chicken and shrimp tasted less like a complex curry and more like a meat and veggie mixture (think bad Chinese) tossed in a paper bag with a whole jar of curry powder When the waiter came to clear our almost-full plates he asked if everything was ok Our philosophy is usually to say something in response to that question only if something is fixable (eg a meat can be redone to be less well-done) In this case the whole restaurant concept seems to be centered on serving flavorless and poor-quality large portions to a university crowd they seem to think is un-discerning With so much wrong a complete overhaul would be necessary And sowe said ""We're just full Thanks"" and got the hell out of there."
3599,0,I took in my 2006 Kenmore vacuum First know that the repair location is offsite and you will only hear from a call center in some other location $45 (non-refundable) upfront gets you a diagnosis 10 days later It applies to the actual repair The call center contacted my to authorize a new motor and filter but could not answer basic questions about the warranty on the new part I had to call back the next day and get someone else on the line I approved the repair and 10 days later they called to get authorization for a different filter I authorized it and thought they were going to tell me I could pick it up the next day but the filters aren't stocked on site or in the store Odd The employee reminded me that my vacuum was a 2006 and technology changes So now I find out I'm repairing a vacuum that they don't even stock filters for anymore and that it is going to take another 10 days for a filter they didn't notice the first time around - seriously I asked them to throw in the $1995 filter for my time inconvience and their oversight in not providing the information at the time I was trying to decide whether to repair the vacuum or buy a new one They refused I forfeited my $45 and asked for my unrepaired vacuum The whole system is an unfortunate mess and exemplifies the reason Sears has fallen from a respected retailer whose products you used to be able to rely on to a stumbling faltering mess The attitude of both the employee on the phone and the one in the repair center store front was that I was unreasonable to expect Sears to offer anything better in terms of service for a 2006 product People who know me know I like to use and repair recycle and reuse rather dumping everything in the landfill What a waste.
287,1,I'm a craft beer lover and I have a new favorite breweryWe've been going here about once a week since they've openedTheir beer is incredible  I particularly like the slowly rotating lineup of Fate beers  Some of my favorites so far the Brown Imperial IPA Cream Ale Irish Red Oatmeal Stout Belgian Saison and Pale AleBut man can't live on beer alone  I think that we've tried all of their pizzas every one delicious  My favorites here are the Rustica Molto Carne Capicola Mediterranean and Fennel SausageThe staff friendly and helpful - the atmosphere casual and comfortable  And for desert awesome little cake pops.

2407,1,The staff is simply the best I frequent this hotel for business and recently had an odd assignment--01 straight nights where I worked a graveyard shift (7pm-7am) The challenge here is that my working/sleeping hours fell outside the normal housekeeping schedule I explained this dilemma with the hotel management and they simply said they'd take care of it They arranged to have my room serviced first thing in the morning so that it would be ready when I came back in the morning and ready to sleep And it worked out well like clockworkThe staff is accommodating and make the effort to remember guests by name What a personal touchInternet speeds are adequate HBO on tap and a decent breakfast spread Overall great value for the business traveler.
4667,0,"It only gets one star because yes there are decent things underneath it all Yes its dirty and unsanitary there was a cockroach in one of the bins But the worst are the employees never met more rude people in my life The guy bringing out bins yelled at me after grabbing one item and it was my first time so I didn't know you weren't allowed to grab until it was all out He talked to the customers like they were dogs ""NO DON'T TOUCH"" and the cashiers talk about hormone driven teens worse than ever We got into one line and the cashier told me I was allowed to go to the next cashier and the next cashier was making out with another employee at the register And she tells us to go back to the other cashier and yells at the girl saying ""can't you see I'm busy"" She didn't even bag the items she just handed me the plastic bags RUDE."
569,1,This place has become a regular date night spot for me and my husband  It has some of the best sushi I have ever tasted by far my favorite dining location in Westgate  For lunch and dinner they have a variety of sushi options cooked and uncooked along with a delicious selection of entrees and appetizersIf you like lobster the Lotus Roll is a must try.
4392,0,Mehpizza was super greasycheese was gummycrust was bland $60 bucks for 2 pizzas and 24 wings not a good deal at all Pat's seems to be a staple in the neighborhood but there are wayyyyy better places within a 1 mile radius Since stumpy's was closed on Sunday we had to resort to Pat's Never again.
1754,1,I looked all over for a lamp repair store  It seemed that there were no such establishments  It then occurred to me that some of the Ace Hardware stores in Washington did light repairs so I took a chance and called the Litchfield Park store  The manager Odis told me to bring it in they would see what they could do  I did they worked on it for at least 20 minutes to a half an hour took it apart replaced a 54 cent something or other and put it back together  They charged me for the part only no labor  They were courteous helpful knowledgable and all around Boy Scouts  I haven't been so impressed by a culture of customer service in I don't know when  I felt like I had time warped back to the fifties  Thank you to Odis and Mick you made my week and saved my antique mall bargain lamp.

1234,0,So I was expecting a lot when I walked in the door here and sadly I have to say that it failed to meet those expectations This place seems on the outside to be a top notch pizza place that makes it's pizza in a coal brick oven like some of the best joints out there However the truth soon becomes apparent once you order your pizza and then wait forever The waitress was very nice and I felt bad for her because the kitchen was quite frankly letting her down big time when it came to getting things out of the oven The pizza took around an hour to get after ordering yes an hour for a coal fired pizza The pizza comes and smells okay but doesn't knock your socks off aroma wise and taste wise was really bland Even the crust which was the best part of it was very bland it lacked flavor The other issue was a lack of toppings and sauce The sauce was missing something and was only lightly dabbled in spots on the pizza and for supposedly real cheese (what little was on it) it was tasteless Being a lover of pizza I was highly saddened by this place that seemed to have soo much potential Pricewise you expect more for what you are paying and everyone in my group was very depressed with the quality I don't however think the place is beyond redemption and if they would make some changes to add some real flavor they could have a nice place here However I won't be going back anytime soon unless I hear they have made some changes I think the only reason this place has been able to make so far is because of its location at the San Tan Marketplace and not really on the merits of its food You end up really wanting to like the place but it just doesn't happenI would suggest if you want a good pizza for around the same price point check out  Venezia Pizza.
4328,0,Pros : clean placeCons: lots The service was horrible especially when you are paying pretty high for the food and drinks Cocktail Drinks cost about $10 and entries average about $16-$24 And when you get bad service for spending so much that would drive me crazy Drinks and food were ok Not the quality I expected There r lots of other restaurants on mill ave that are far betterIn short I personally would not recommend this place to any of my friends n relatives.
3481,0,Made reservations through Opentable on 12/22 for reservations at 8:15 pm at Prado on 12/31/12 for a New Years and my birthday celebration  Called Prado the next day to confirm just to be sure  On the day of the reservation hostess called me and left a msg to see if we were doing New Years Eve menu or not  Upon calling back we were notified that there were no 8:15 spots like we had booked and there was only seating at 6 or 9 and only a New years eve menu was to be offered at either $90 (at 6pm) or $150 (at 9 pm) per person  This was quite inconvenient especially since I am a vegetarian and was counting on being able to order from the regular dinner menu  Manager had no suitable solutions to offer us and we cancelled  Extremely disappointed in opentable and Prado  WIll not dine here in the future and will unrecommend to others.
888,1,This place is awesome I had never been but stopped by after needing scrubs for school The girl working was very helpful and offered to clear my hands and start me a fitting room right away They have great prices and everything was easy to find Was also very excited when she told me $1499 and $999 items were 50% off that day I bought 4 scrub tops and two bottoms for only $40 I asked for business cards and received a calendar that let's me know what deals they have on each day I would definitely recommend them and already have to my classmates.
2142,1,Welcome to CentPho Los TaquitosBeen wanting to check out Los Taquitos other location for a while then I saw they opened up at 16th/GlendaleWent for the street tacos Had 1 carne asada 2 carnitas and one each of the other pork varieties All were excellent very fresh crispy fresh double-tortillas The hot sauce is delicious and they brought a squeeze bottle to the table for me which is a big plus I also tried the Habanero sauce - not too insanely hot at first but the kind of heat that creeps up The whole lunch was $8 so I will be backBOTTOM LINE: Welcome to PHX I will be a regular.
2905,1,I will try catfish and southern food where ever I can find it and I had a Livingsocial for this place so even though it was out of my way I decided to try it I don't like spicy anything but I have to say that I also thought this was the best catfish I've had So much so that I had to go back and make sure I didn't think it was so good only because I was hungry It was just as good the second time This time I decided to try some of the sides The mac and cheese was just okay I've had better The greens were just too bitter for me I couldn't finish them But I will definitely be back for catfish and try the BBQ next time Very friendly people working there.
4188,0,I hated this place I was there for work and I worked nights every morning at about 8 o'clock there would be music blaring right outside my room everyday I had to call and have them stop it They would take about a half hour well I was up by then The rooms were cramped and there was a sliding door that never quite closed on the bathroom door The location was nice But stay at the hilton across the street.

611,1,We ate out on the patio last night The weather was gorgeous the band was terrific and the food was delicious In my previous review I forgot to mention their margaritas They are my favorite margs in town They are expensive but I love the fresh lime juice I had the special which was grouper fish with asparagus and mashed potatoes It was very flavorful and nicely prepared My friend ordered seafood tacos.
4985,0,I know little about windshields glass glass repair etcI was referred to American Glass by Tempe Auto Repair (whom I really like) when my wife's car had a cracked windshield The crack was getting dangerous and needed to be fixed American Glass is close to our home and after the referral figured that this was a good decisionI called and left a voice mail to set up an appointment No call My wife called again a few days later and the owner said there was no voice mail and maybe I called somewhere else She wasn't very friendly I had the business card and heard the American Glass message I know where I called Should have been my first warningMy wife did take her car to get the window fixed as this needed to be done rather than shop around any longer This process went pretty well and the windshield was fixed the same day The big issue was dealing with my insurance company and American Glass This process could have been handled betterWithin a month of the windshield being repaired  a rock hit my wife's windshield again and left a ding My insurance company (State Farm) advised us to contact the Glass Company to repair the windshield as this should be under warranty and be fixed without cost or little costWe contacted American Glass and we were told that it would not be covered and we would have to pay for a new windshield at full cost The woman was not very friendly in her handling of this issue HMMMM Forget that State Farm informed me that any reputable glass company would stand behind their work and offer to fix the problem State Farm then provided us another provider to correct the ding in the windshield (My wife will write a review on this)I would suggest that you go somewhere else when getting a new windshield repaired etc I can only warn others to steer clear of this business and the woman who runs this place.
4561,0,Not happy What a shady placeI call to make an appointment and get a quote as I haves budge to love by Our dog only needed his yearly shots and a check up What they quoted and what they actually charged was WAY off Then they convince me to have his anal glands extracted and hand me a bottle of allergy spray only to find out I would be charged extra for THAT I refused the spray much to the nurse's disdain and argued that I was not asked permission or told the additional cost of the anal extraction They scammed me and on top of that the doctor talked more about his own dogs than actually talking about mine his own patient Will not be going here again :(.
2426,0,I've had the worst food going experience at this place The food kept me up all night puking Never will I come here again From the reviews I've read it sounds like its not a very clean restaurant I'd also like to see a health inspection here.
4863,0,"To Serve or Not Serve Hello Yelpers Recently  I had a experience at a Golden Corral Restaurant that concerned me enough to write to their corporate office not once but twice  After receiving ""no response"" I thought I might as well add this to my "" Yelp"" reviews""  I believe it's incumbent upon management to put things right for any and all concerns a guest may have while dining at their establishment I have never experienced Management at a corporate level fail to respond in a timely manner when a guest addressed a concern With the vast amount of establishments to dine at one would think that the last thing management at any restaurant would want is to have a guest  leave unhappy or in my case to never come back again  Rather then writing a strategic rant I have decided to attach the letter I sent to corporate headquarters September 23 2013 Corporate Office of Golden Corral I am writing this letter to discuss a recent experience I had at your Golden Corral restaurant located at 420 N Dysart Rd Goodyear Arizona (623) 925-9075  I have visited this location many times and have always enjoyed the quality of food and superior service  However my latest visit to Golden Corral has me very concerned as a guest   On Saturday September 21 around 1130 AM I visited your restaurant to purchase a dozen rolls for a BBQ I was having later that day  When I returned home and opened the box of rolls I noticed that the rolls were hard and somewhat overcooked  I realize this has happened to us all at one time or another Each of us has ordered food at a restaurant and gotten something that differs from our expectations to some degree I appreciate that restaurant work is a very challenging business and sometimes cooks and chefs can get caught up in a multitude of orders all at the same time and the quality of a product can suffer  I usually do not return food but I really wanted to serve the rolls at the BBQ so I went back to have the rolls replaced I arrived at the restaurant around 1:25 pm and asked to speak with a manager (whose name I do not recall)  To be fair the manager came over apologized and he offered a replacement dozen of rolls fresh out of the oven and advised it would be about 6 minutes That was nice my concern lies in the statement the manager made after he took the dozen rolls I brought back  The manager asked if I had ""touched the rolls"" because if I had not touched the rolls they could be used to make ""bread pudding""  At that moment I wanted to leave the restaurant and I would have left had the replacement rolls not came fresh out of the oven My concern lies in the area of food health and safety issues  Is taking returned food from guest and reusing it standard operating procedure for Golden Corral I am not an expert by any means in the area of food preparation  However I do realize that food safety is a scientific discipline and the proper handling preparation and storage of food is the only way  to prevent foodborne illness Food can transmit disease from person to person and standard precautions should always be adhered to  When you are a guest at any food establishment your thought is the food ought to be safe and the preparation of the food should be such as to avoid potentially severe health hazards such as taking returned food from a guest and reusing that product I am not sure if I will ever revisit Golden Coral again but I know without a doubt that  I will never go back to your Avondale location  The thought of reusing food that a guest returned is enough to keep me from coming back to that location Thanks Dxxxx Gxxxxxxx 1xxxx W Xxxxxxxxx Ave Xxxxxxxx  Arizona xxx-xxx-xxxx."

3964,0,We went to CPK and it was terrible our server was in our face the whole time It was as if she was trying to rush us out and there was no wait for tables Then we had another server running the floor vacuum around our table and under our table hitting our feet I hate when restaurants allow this practice It is discussing and intrusive with little regard for your customers The food was cold and flavorless I will never return to this restaurant avoid it's a waste of your $$$.
974,1,Recently had a wonderful dinner here We started off with an order of bruschetta which was incredibly fresh Then we each had a personal pizza the Regina Margherita and the Pomo All of the ingredients were perfection and the dough was nice and thin While we were waiting on our tiramasu (which was incredible) the head chef Matteo brought us a cinnamon liqueur that tasted like Cinnabon in a shot The service was great the patio was pleasant and the food could not have been better.
3005,1,Great great greasy yummy pizza.
54,1,This place rocks  Great vino great food great atmosphere  If you're looking to impress a date with something more than a bar happy hour this is the place.
2121,1,This place is a killer find and I can't wait to go back again to try their new menu that they introduced yesterday  We went on Monday and the place was jumping  A group of friends and I sat at the bar and had good service great wine (they have a very eclectic wine list) and the food was AMAZING  Although the bar is a totally cool place to sit the next time I want to sit on a patio I'm heading here  Great job.
3157,0,Maybe it will get better but this was pretty terrible beer  Had the Industrial Pale Ale which just tasted weird  Had a few sips and left it - not worth the calories  The oatmeal stout is okay tasting but pretty watery and weak - tastes like something from Salt Lake City where you can't have a beer higher than 3% or something  The place looks cool and the bathroom is nice and the folks serving are pretty nice  But I'll head over to Taste of Tops Four Peaks or Papago if I'm in the area.
1621,1,Not knowing my way around Mill Avenue in Tempe I was nearly stymied trying to find these theaters The street numbering system made no sense But a quick question to a loitering local solved my problem I was pointed in the right direction and then quickly hit up for a buck for booze Regardless I stumbled into this strange venue noticing people exiting with musical instruments I surmised the underground movie action I was looking for lay upstairs since that's where folks seemed to be gathering Turns out the concession line doubled as the box office line so I asked for one adult and some peanut M & M'sI enjoyed my time at the movie This was a showing of the original 70's version of The Inglorious Bastards and the crowd was chock full of geeks and fanboys eagerly awaiting the upcoming 2009 Quentin Tarantino purposefully misspelled version I was brought here by reading a blurb in the Phoenix New Times but came to find out that this was just one of the many underground movies put on by Midnite Movie Mamacita (wwwmidnitemoviemamacitacom)The theater we were in held only about 100 chairs but was perfect for such a small group (about 40 in attendance) The movie was quite dated and groanworthy at times but the venue was small enough that audience members periodically offered commentary in the spirit of Mystery Science Theater 3000 At the end of the movie a Quentin Tarantino trivia contest (with prizes) was held with the audience I walked out of there with a free movie posterI'll be back to check out this venue if not for another Midnite Movie Mamacita movie then for another event hosted by the Mill Avenue District Community Arts Project (MADCAP).

144,1,"We eat out frequently and we have our usual fave haunts and places around Phoenix for dinner or weekend eats  We try different things a lot of it palatable most of it good and some of it great  But when you enjoy a meal that is truly superb in every sense of the word it sticks with you  Superb describes our recent experience at Distrito in Old Town Scottsdale  Located inside the toney Saguaro Hotel (hipster haven and loved it) Distrito is a lone outpost holding down the fort in far flung Arizona leagues from its' Garces Group cousins back east  I was surprised to learn that Garces Group which apparently has a stronghold in the Philadelphia and Atlantic City food scenes has a few outliers here in the Southwest Distrito & Old Town Whiskey at The Saguaro in Scottsdale and Tonto & El Jefe in the swanky Saguaro Hotel in Palm Springs  Personally I'm a big fan of indie & local but I also think there's  a place for regional chainlets to show their colors  Garces Croup's Distrito does just thatOur meal at Distrito was my freshman introduction to the Gacrces Group and man it made a great first impression on me  The menu is chock full of small plates and sharing options (as well as as full meals) so we took a snacky approach to dinner  My other half and I wanted to sample a variety of items from the menu and agreed we'd get more bang for our buck by going micro rather than limiting ourselves to just an app and a main course  I'm glad we didWe started off with the guacamole a tell-tale bell weather of how the rest of the meal might go at any restaurant and we were more than delighted with the fresh hand-hacked guac dusted with fresh cotija cheese and delicious chips  We decided to splurge a bit and added the fresh crab (only $5) and didn't regret it for one second The crab was so fresh I'd swear we were dining on the beach in the Chesapeake Bay (except we'd never get avocados that fresh in MD) so we were thrilled with the bi-coastal comboMoving onto the ""Snacks"" or Antojitos section we split an order of Rellenitos  A clever twist on the classic ""Chile Relleno"" this bad boy was served sliced  each piece breaded and fried to perfection with the tastiest smoked tomato sofrito I've ever had the pleasure of spooning past my lips  150% scrumptiousMy other half scarfed Pescado Tacos after the server told him the fish of the day (the species escapes me now) that constituted the fish tacos  Divine  We then each split Small Plates of Queso Fundido (with a savory Duck Barbacoa) and Chilpachole de Mariscos a spicy seafood stew  My boif loved the Queso (I'm not a huge fan of duck but it was very tasty) and I laid quick waste to the bowl of Chilpacholewhich was chock full of fresh mussels clams and hand-made masa dumplings  The stew sauce alone is incomparable and I've been craving a return visit since we ate there even if just for this dish aloneRounding out the extraordinary (and I do not use that word lightly  This meal was EXTRA-ordinary) I give big props to the staff and service of Distrito Scottsdale  Our server was adorable knowledgeable friendly and quick as a flash with food drink refills and answering questions for us  The General Manager Niels even stopped by our table to chat with us check on everything and make sure we were enjoying ourselves  That is rare in this day and age and I appreciate the personalized attention brief and non-intrusive conversation and approachability  I told him we'd be back and I stay true to my promisesApparently Distrito has a revamped menu and is remodeling inside  If there were one thing I would take points off for it would and could only be the décor -- in that I was facing a blank wall during dinner Considering that my attention was fully focused on the fantastic food savory servings and the company of my adorable other half I barely even noticed the wallsI'd like to go back to Distrito soon (even if just for that Chilpachole seasfood stew) and pace myself so I could try their Platos Fuertes (Large Plates) and dessert menu We never even made it that far because we were STUFFED on apps and small plates For 2 big boys to not reach dessert phase you know the portions are generous and the servings substantial  I'd also like to get a group together some time and give their Taco Bar a try  It's $25 per person (min 2 peeps) and features an assortment of tasty Latino fare that I'm sure would knock my socks off -- if it's anything like the meal we experienced 2 weeks ago at Distrito in Old Town Scottsdale inside The Saguaro Hotel  Definitely A++ Distrito."

2771,1,Very rare to find a place where everything on the menu looks goodThis place is a breath of fresh airit's been a while since a restaurant in Phoenix has really impressed me (Although this is technically in Scottsdale haha) I'm not kidding EVERYTHING on the menu looked delish I finally settled on the Orrechiette a handmade pasta with fennel sausage broccoli rabe and local chiliesit was DIVINEthe best Italian  I've had since Arrivederci in San Diego (see previous review) They even make everything fresh to order (so my dairy allergy was not a problem) My husband had the pork shankit was absolutely falling off the bone just mouth watering delicious The flavors had just soaked all the way through the meat totally an insane dish My friend had the Salmon salad again her fish was cooked to perfection no fishy-ness whatsoeverOur server was extremely nice  (a little nervous it seemed but nice) We CANNOT wait to come back and try their Four Square deal - from 4-6 you can get 1 free appetizer and 1 dessert with the purchase of 2 entréesnot bad right.
3172,0,"I should have read Alexander's Yelp review before I ventured out of my La Quinta hotel during my business trip  But we went here for a quick dinner and although their fried ice cream was pretty above average it couldn't equal out for their horrendous spinach enchiladas  Everything was mushy tasting and their white sauce topping on the enchiladas looked like that kind of cheesy topping that is microwaved from 3 days ago  Hal-O-Peno's is a nice pun but doesn't qualify as being a good quality Mexican establishment  Keep walking down the street to find better food  This is the second Yelp ""warning""."

3650,0,Disappointing I have been to two other TK's (Scottsdale and Tempe) and had a better experience at both First off the soda mix was messed up Now I can get over this because that is the way these things work You usually have little to no warning when the mix goes bad but it took about 10 minutes for the waitress to get me a new drink The sandwich was not good eitherthe French/ Irish dip was totally bland The au jus had a little flavor which helped me choke it down but I'd never order it again Our waitress was nice even though she was completely overwhelmed but a couple of the other servers looked downright pissed off and mean This establishment will probably be very profitable because of its location within CityScape The alcohol sales alone will probably be enough to keep it in the black If I ever go back it will be for adult beverages only I'd rather get a hot dog at Chase or US AirwaysAt least the boobies are fun to look at.
1895,1,This place is so stinking cute you should definitely pop by I was lured in by the smell when I was in the area on a Saturday morning and was greeted by the owner and her lovely daughter This family is so sweet and they let me sample a few flavors I've been to other gourmet popcorn shops in NYC but this was the first I've seen in AZ They had tons of crazy flavors like Strawberry and Blueberry Mojito I ended up buying two medium-size bags of Caramel and Garlic Parmesan under $10 total Definitely recommend.
4905,0,Went in on Sunday after dinner to have a nice treat Bought the yogurt and sat in the back to look at the lake and hang out with my wife We noticed on the floor what appeared to be rodent droppings ( we own hamsters and are familiar with the look) So we bring it to the attention of the employee He goes with my wife and notices the same thing we did and unsure tries to call his manager We leave and leave our number to speak with him regarding this issue He calls us back and proceeds to harass my wife and accuse us of trying to ruin his business Look we were trying to point out a potential issue and this guy calls to yell at us I will never frequent this establishment again and have already begun to tell all of my friends as to the RUDE nature of how this situation was handled.

3336,0,OVERPRICED AND OVERRATEDI cannot believe how much money I spent here for two sandwiches and two sodas  $2546The mozzerlla panini had tasteless tomatoes the thinnest slice of procutto that had a large peice of fat in it causing me to nearly gag  Plesto sauce was okayThe roast beef sandwhich was a huge dissappointement  Two thick slices of overdone beef two thick slices of cheese and a tasteless tomatoe with the top hard vine connector still attached (who wants to eat that)  When I say thick I mean 1/6 thick but did not cover from side to side of the bread  These sandwhiches were $950 eachWe got one with pasta salad (corkscrew pasta and a dressing no veggies or color) and a green salad (lettuce and dressing nothing else)We also got two diet cokes  In a can  For $225 each  They did'nt offer a glass ice and straw which in my oppinion might account for the upcharge but no nothing nietThis place might be okay if you are in the area at the building working or visiting someone but we drove from Ahwatukee  So not worth it  Do not drive to this place  Do not go out of your way for this place.
4206,0,Stopped in this morning to get breakfast for my team and got a huge serving of bad attitude from the staff  This is the first and last time I'll set foot in this place I'll go up the street to Einstein's where I can get food without the 'tude.
348,1,All 5 & Diners are not equal This location is one of my favorites--they just seem to go the extra mile It doesn't matter what time of day I stop inmiddle of a weekday after midnight on a weekendthe place is friendly and busy There is another closer to my house but this location wins my heart every time Another bonus Their table side jukeboxes actually work Our most recent visit  was for post-fireworks dessert We finally tried the new menu The Waffle Wonder was a hit Half a waffle (by the way this location's waffles are superior to all others) covered in cinnamon sugar vanilla ice cream chocolate syrup and caramel It tasted like a supercharged churro So yummy My friend got the Diner Split which might seem run-of-the-mill but it had a large scoop each of vanilla chocolate and strawberry ice cream with all the requisite sauces plus a deep fried banana Yep you heard right deep-fried freakin' banana I had a chocolate malted and could not have been happierNext time you need a great way to cap off a late downtown night check this place out.
2671,1,Excellent lunch  We were in the area and based on the reviews I figured it's worth a try  The club sandwich and the asparagus & havarti panini were both excellent  And the delicious cookie was a nice touchIts a small cafe with like 10 or 15 tables  You order at the counter and they bring your food  The coffee is self serve  There's a nice sandwich selection along with salads soup and some breakfast sandwiches  Not to mention all the bakery itemsThe food is fresh and tasty  And a good value the sandwiches are under $7It was definately worth the try  We don't get to this area much but Bertha's just might be worth a special trip.

4568,0,"This review is for the SanTan Honda Service Dept:I would not recommend them  They failed to fix my '08 Civic  Turns out there was carbon build up in one of the cylinder heads on the engine  A dealer out of state fixed it because San Tan lacked any expertise in problem solving  They just depended on my car's ""computer"" to tell them there was something wrong  Too bad the car's computer wasn't that smart Glad someone else fixed it by working hard with the Honda Tech line."

4612,0,"Been here a few times and this time was the worse  May be they were too caught up this time with the Ferrari Club who had stopped byCold food very small portions for entrees guests were shocked at just how small looked like an appetizer  Food is also just not very good this is KFC quality at very high pricesService was slow and impersonal and the restaurant was quiet- two meals arrived over twenty minutes late not the ""it will be ready in two minutes"" promised by the waiter and came with no apology nor any impact to the bill  I brought it to the manager's attention no apology and off she went to do something more important  Really bad experience  This was a table of +12 that they could have cared less about  Wow to be that cavalierCannot imagine returning anytime soon  I work once a month close by and will not be taking any clients here until there are drastic changes  Too many other restaurants within walking distance."
895,0,"So I have been wanting to come to this joint for EVA How-EVA our experience was not fabulous It was more like DRAB-ulous Things started out great when we snagged a cozy little table in the corner about 9pm on a Friday night The liquor wall looked too tempting to pass up so I ordered a Gibson with some Tito's vodka (my fav)- well the cocktail onions were soggy and mushy upon first bite and it pretty much ruined the drink The server did not offer to bring me something different he just apologized and looked for the jar of onions and said they are all like that Hmmmm There were a MILLION specials It took like 5 minutes literally to read the entire list It was baffling The prices are NOT cheap We were already thinking we should give this place a shot during $5 plate happy hour Anyway then we ordered some grilled oysters Well they came out with Chirozo on them- and I barely eat seafood but definitely not pork All the server said was ""Well it listed the chorizo on the menu""- Hmmmmmm Again we just kept them Then my boyfriend tried one and it was full of sand At this point we had already ordered the mushroom toast points but after the oyster debacle we had pretty much decided to go elsewhere and especially when the next appetizer came it just was overloaded with brie and canned looking mushrooms totally overcooked and unappetizing We politely told the server that we were just going to call it a night (there was NO WAY we were going to spend 35-40 bucks on the entree lottery)- he then offered to ""do anything"" to make our experience better and we thanked him and just explained why we were leaving and we would be back to try the happy hour another time (truth) Anyway then he took like 15 minutes at least trying to get the manager to take the oysters off (I would rather have paid for them) and then he FINALLY brought us our bill with the two drinks AND the uneaten mushroom appetizer I am a foodie and have been in the business since I was 15 and I NEVER EVER want anything for free or removed from my check however there are certain circumstances- and I must say I can not remember having a completely horrible experience like this one on a long time- where I feel  that as a server let alone a manager- I would comp the entire tab and offer to have the guest back on some sort of gift certificate or comp  Again I NEVER EVER look for anything free in a restaurant but if you had been sitting in my shoes last night you would agree this experience warranted some above and beyond customer service to retain guests in the future Well that didn't happen perhaps they have been around so long they just figure oh well who cares we are well known so whatever Well whatever is I will NEVER attend that restaurant or any of their other concepts plus now I have written a poor review and all my FB friends know about it too I'm sure in my life moving forward Rokerij will also come up in conversation with some of my foodie friends and they too will know I think this place is overrated We left the waiter a very nice tip and thanked them by never attending their establishment again Such a shame Customer service is dead these days SIghHope it was worth the $30 bucks guys."
1845,1,We recently visited Saba's for dinner for the first time  The food is prepared fresh and many of the dishes were created by the owner George  We enjoyed visiting with George and learning of the long history of the family owned restaurant The atmosphere was relaxing and the staff very attentive We really enjoyed our menu selections and have many more dishes to look forward to  We'll definitely recommend Saba's.
912,1,I have been here quite a few times and i have to say i never get tired of it The wine and Bruschetta Special is the best for only $20 during certain times The environment is chill and welcomingI recommended to anyone looking for that something different.
362,1,Great staff great prices as always Thanks.
1135,1,The food here is always delicious I have never had to wait to be seated The service is great and every server I have had there was quick attentive and not annoying The restaurant is intimate and I always feel relaxed there We ordered the cornbread which was awesome I have to say I don't usually eat salads at all But when I read what the Macho Salad had in it I decided to give it a try and wow it was excellent It had avocado roasted chicken chopped almonds and goat cheese I never like salads but this one is incredible I love it I get it everytime I go A family member of mine always gets the Bandera- Style roasted chicken which is always good and roasted to perfection I have gone here a couple times and each time it has been excellent.
2036,1,Came here for a celebratory dinner for my friend There were about 15 in our group and we were seated outside on the well heated patio We had five heaters around usWe had two servers who were super efficient They got drink orders in and out with each guest/s that arrived at all the various times The group started with 2 orders of the chicken nachitos loaded with yummy guacamole that were quickly devoured For my main entree I ordered the surf and turf tacos which consists of lobster and filet mignon I like the fact that Chelsea's Kitchen offers gluten free options without extra charge but I still went with the corn tortillas that come standard with any taco entree option Holy delicious I can't even accurately describe the party that went on in my mouth The dish came with a kale salad guacamole and pico de gallo There were two dipping sauces aioli and a salsa type the aioli came out on top and landed on every bite that went into my mouth I really wanted to lick the little container it came it but I had to pretend to be a lady The filet was cooked medium but looking back I should have gotten it prepared at the medium rare temperature because the outside was pretty cooked For dessert I split the sundae with a friend and I love that you get to put your own toppings on When you order the sundae you get two sauces: carmel and chocolate and three toppings: rainbow sprinkles (or jimmies for my East Coasters) Oreo crumbles and chocolate and peanut butter chips So fun to create your own dessertThe service and food were spectacular (especially for a large group) and I can't wait to come back for another meal.

1850,1,Yard House the yin to my wallet's yang Beer selection: awesome Beer and food prices: highI'm a huge fan of draft beer While some like to play with Belgian lambics I'm still in the hoppy stages of youth swimming in IPAs and west coast bitters They have around 10 different IPAs to choose from and their beer menu awesomeness is well-documented in other reviews For all the shortcomings the number of high-quality beers and tasty food has my review eternally pegged at five starsSo let's talk about what I don't like Prices I know I've said it twice but it is the only reason we don't visit more often We once had an appetizer come out unforgiveably dirty But it didn't bother us because once we told our waiter no less than two servers and a manager came to apologize If they make a mistake they more than compensate and obviously care a great deal about customer serviceHere are some of the other things I like The turkey burger is to die for We've ordered it twice and will probably order it every second or third time we visit The fries are tasty crispy and wonderful but because they are thin the temp drops quickly We try to eat the fries before the burger but it's difficult because the burger is just so darn tastyMy wife isn't crazy about the pizzas I would order them again although I will never say it is the best pizza I've ever tried I think we've only tried cheese pepperoni and bbqBut the turkey pot pie The mac and cheese (with chicken and bacon their top seller) The Maui chicken The Avocado Swiss burger Yeah those are the best I've ever had Here are some more details: pot pie is huge covered with the tastiest flakiest croissant crust imaginable The mac and cheese is legendary a must try The Avocado Swiss burger was juicy had half of an avocado and the creamiest of swiss cheeses What I liked about the Maui chicken was that it was prepared not thrown together The vegetables were really cooked in a delicious sauce and instead of drowning in sauce they were imbibed with it Just perfectionObviously we will be going again Love it Can't get enough.
3341,0,"Nice try but no cigar as they say  There's not enough shade to enjoy this park during the day most of the year  There's no grass  It's too small for a big dog to really run  The trashy people that frequent it don't clean up after their dogs so you really need to watch your step  Worst of all people ignore the signage and bring their un-neutered dogs into the park  On a recent foray the next two people to enter the park after me had un-neutered males who immediately tried to hump my spayed female  The sign in front of the park clearly states that the city ""highly recommends"" only spayed/neutered pets in order to avoid aggressive behavior""  Makes me think they probably don't get their dogs shots either  I moved to downtown to avoid driving excessive distances but it seems like I need to go to the suburbs to enjoy a dog park where the owners are responsible."

2781,1,I've been cutting my hair here for more than a year already every two weeks  I was a bit skeptical about going here to get a fade but ended up with a pretty good hair cut for cheap  My usual haircut is a 3 at the top and 0 on the sides with a medium high fade  Two barbers I highly suggest you go to that does an awesome job is Maria and Malorie If you end up going to this place a lot or any other Great Clips Take advantage of the current special which is buying pre-paid haircuts for $999  They recently raised their regular hair cuts from $12 to $13 not too long ago.

4281,0,I received the worst service of my existence at this establishment - absolutely awful  uncaring and embarrassing Our group of 17 arrived at 11am before the rush for a retirement party Shortly thereafter orders were taken and others arrived about 15 minutes later and there orders were taken All were served except me Even those with late orders- my order was nothing special tuna melt  Others who ordered the same received there food completed it and still nothing for me When approached by the manager/ jerk on duty- was told we will get to it  How awful- it makes one not want to attend large luncheons   Pass the word don't go to this establishmentThanks much.

4425,0,Forget itAs a child my parents and I would make the drive out here once a month to eat I loved it I remember it being almost 'grandma's house' friendly I don't remember much about the food but I've been back a few times more recently (before the change in ownership) and loved itBut then some very shady things happened and the business was essentially stolen from the long-time owners I shamefully say that I've since been twice It's not the same by any means There's no soul in the (albeit basic no fancy stuff here) food preparation It's a cold atmosphere as well And the atmosphere used to BE the place There are a few other decent places around Avoid the new Satisfied FrogIt's sad Well according to the website the previous and rightful owners have a new place up in Black Canyon City I'm hoping to be up that way some time soon with any hope the old atmosphere has been transferred.
4843,0,Wow what a disappointment  I ended up in your restaurant with a referral from my mother in-law After being seated we were slowly greeted by an underwhelmed lack luster waitress named carrie only to find out half way through our meal Carrie was pushy and obnoxious about taking our order and only after sorting out the terribly confusing two menus we decided on our meals My mothers order came without the fries she ordered and I'm pretty sure our final checks were not correct Not only do I believe the prices are above average I was charged for two separate drinks I understand mix ups but I feel more as if this particular situation was intentional unfortunate Not only was service below par I had to ask for refills on my own drinks because the attention to our table was so overlooked Adding insult to injury we were the only table in carries section aside from one man pulled up to the bar The food was poor the service sucked for lack of a better word and overall nothing worth coming back for For a personal referral I'm  disappointed and frustrated in this experience what a shame.
1807,1,"Inta Juice is a great place  I have been taking my kids here since they opened  I have gotten to know the owners by name (Tom and Anita)  They know my daughter by name as she is the one that comes with me most frequently  We all like the ""Lime Your Mine"" smoothie as well as the ""Fruit Kiss""  I agree with Merle that I go out of my way to support the nonchain food establishments  I get a shot of wheatgrass everytime I go there  It has become an acquired taste for me  This place is great  If you want a smoothie go here."
13,1,Why is everyone else writing their reviews on the listing on Hanna Wrong address peepsSo I had been wanting to eat here for a while but everytime I come to Westgate it was to meet friends at one of the big restaurants thereSo I came here today on my own for lunch It was pretty easy to figure out how to order (you pick a bag by number that corresponds to the category number on the menu then you choose your toppings)I got the Ruben with provolone and thousand island and I substituted the sauerkraut for  coleslaw and it came toasted I also ordered the house chips which are homemade potato chips with salt and pepperSo I got my sandwich and was surprised at how small it was It was significantly smaller than the sandwich places I normally go to So I ignored the size and dove in WOW The bread was so good Toasted without being dry light The meat was perfectly cooked not chewy like the last sandwich I ordered at another place the coleslaw was so good and flavorful juicy without dripping all over the place The chips were also really good Now the sandwich was smaller than I am used to but it wound up being the perfect size It was so good I can't wait to go back.

1036,1,This place has everything Not always the best prices But if you need it for a crazy/fun recipe you will find it at BevMoI had a themed party for the Moscow Mule last month and BevMo was the only location that had the Cock and Bull Ginger Beer The drink was deliciousI do think it is very funny how BevMo is usually just around the corner from the Total Wine in The Valley almost like fast food chains for adults.
471,1,Impressive every timeHave been back a few times since my last review  Visited yesterday and all is still excellent  Pizzas remain incredibly yummy service is fast and kind and it's an excellent choice when you have kids  The dough they give younglings to play with keeps them occupied and is a winner of an ideaWe had one boo-boo where the server mixed up my little girl's order  The manager immediately came out apologized and said it was on them  An occasional error happens and I told him that was nice to offer but not necessary  TIP: We ordered a Reese's Peanut Butter Cup Cheesecake to share for dessert-- makes you want to say Hallelujah after each bite  The bill came and both my daughter's meal and the dessert were credited back  I made it up on the tip side but it was a forthright gesture that the place wants to nail the dining experience every time  NICE.
2076,1,Everyone knows the spa is great but what about the poolI'm a bit biased because I don't technically have to crash this pool I have a key  My family has a home right next to the resort so I've had the ability to use their pool since I was bornPersonally I think it's worth it to spring for a spa treatment while your there and take advantage of the adults only pool  Otherwise the pools are not much to look at  The Jackrabbit Pool attracts more kids and poolside service ends at 8pm (sometimes 4pm in the summer) but I believe the pool itself is open 24 hours  The other pool the Garden Pool usually has less kids and also has poolside service Basically this is a valley establishment and that is why I like it  There are probably more exciting pools to crash but this is an old standby  Also it is currently undergoing renovationsUpdate:  I guess you don't need a key anymore- so feel free to walk in like you own the place:).

3555,0,"I must fill you in on a Little back story before I tell you about my experience with Fletcher's Tire and AutoA month or so ago I had to get a mobile locksmith to come to me because my car wasn't starting with the key I had While the mobile locksmith was making the key I had an emergency call and had to leave right away He didn't finish the key but I put the key he was in the process of making in my carforgetting all about itForward to today I dropped my car off at Fletchers because something was going on with it and smoke was coming out of my engine They called me the next day to tell me that it was gonna cost me $55000 Thinking that we should get a second opinion the hubby and I went down to pick up the car When we pulled up we noticed that the car was in the same exact parking spot that we had left it in when we dropped it off but didnt really think too much of it at that time We told them that we were gonna take our car and get a second opinion they gave us our key back and we were on our way We tried starting our car with the key we left for them and it wouldn't start We used the master key and it started right up ( I had given them the key that the locksmith made for me not knowing it wouldn't start my car )When we got home I called Fletcher's back and asked them if they had any problems starting my car up ( damn well knowing they couldn't start my car ) and his response was"" nope it started right up Didn't have a problem with it at all"" how could that be when the key we had given them didn't start my car at allKnowing that they were dishonest we knew we weren't taking the car back there for the repairs it needed Long story short We ended up having it fixed for $10800 AND FLETCHER'S WASN'T EVEN CORRECT WITH THEIR DIAGNOSIS It turned out it was something totally different AND WAY CHEAPER What they said was wrong with my car wasn't what it was AT ALLI will NEVER take my car back there again I need to trust the people that work on my car."
3739,0,This place was filthy We ate at a Sizzlers in Cottonwood AZ 2 days before and we liked it soo much we decided to look for one close to our Phoenix hotel Since there are only 2 Sizzlers in Phoenix we picked this one and arrived  aroung 630 pm We entered this place and were kind of welcomed by a grumpy manager( that should have been a sign) placed our order and looked for a clean table We found 1 in a corner the rest wasn't cleanedWe took our plastic plates and went to the salad-bar Several trays were empty and were not refilled The fries were cold there was food everywhere on the floor I ate my steak which was ok my wife didn't eat anything i drank my Coke(no refills) asked for the bill and went to the bathroom Oh my Godno words for this experienceNever again in this dump They should go to Cottonwood to learn how to run a restaurant in a proper way.
2309,1,Lux has some of the best espresso I have ever had the opportunity to slurp  However I'm sucker for the hip atmosphere and good indie music  What I'm saying is even if the coffee was not top notch I would probably still visit  I know people make fun of hipsters who sit around on their laptops and write wrist slashing poetry but there is just something about the atmosphere here that helps me think a bit clearer  Like I said earlier this isn't just a hip place to sit  The coffee here is splendid and the froth designs on the top are always a welcome addition to my the rich coffee goodness  It is expensive so I don't go everyday like some of Lux's more affluent customers but luckily Lux sells their espresso for me to take home and brew myself  After I brew a couple shots I sit at my dining room table blast some indie music put on my black framed glasses read a Chuck Palahniuk book and think about how cool I am.

3268,0,"COCKROACH  Oh Carraba's  I've always like their food and their service but don't have the stomach to ever return to this location  On my recommendation the family came here for my mother's bday dinner in mid-July  (Luckily) before our food arrived something caught my eye on the half wall directly above the infant carrier  In the middle of the restaurant at peak dining time there was a roach  I pulled the carrier away quickly and my fiance killed it with a napkin  Roaches are possibly the most disgusting thing on the planet that I can think of  I may have a roach phobia if that's possible  Anyway we discreetly told the server who to his credit was incredibly alarmed and handled it beautifully  He immediately went to his manager (we watched)  That's when it went wrong  We waited for probably 1005min for the manager to come over  He followed protocol and told us our entire table tab is free  He also offered to still serve us our food or send it home with us  Uh no thanks  But then he asked for an address giving the reason that the pest control company likes to contact us when this occurs  This made us wonder about the frequency of this occurrence so we asked him if this happens often  If there is a time to lie buddy it's now but I'm not sure he did  He said ""Well I don't want to say it's often but it does happen""  Then he followed it up with a list of reasons why it happens---they come in on the boxes etc  This didn't make the situation better  Then he told us they usually only see the roaches when they turn the lights on in the kitchen  I know restaurant kitchens usually have some roaches and it's a controlled situation but he made it sound like Joe's Apartment and this roach didn't even talk to me  To finish this long story I purposely waited to write this review to see if the pest control company would contact us  We never heard from Carraba's again or their mystery pest control company and a roach out in the middle of a bunch of people in the early evening is a sign that there are probably many many more everywhere else  Too bad for the servers of Carraba's--they really are top notch  We moved nearby to Charleston's and they were so good they gained our repeat business."

3961,0,WTF.
2044,1,It is what it isIt's not a bar or a night club  It's a big brewery with a tasting room  And as that it's perfect  It's in an industrial warehouse setting with an interior view overlooking the production equipmentThe place is about parking your butt for a while sampling their brews and getting a chance to try new stuff that is hard to find elsewhere while cooling off and munching some pretzels      They do offer grilled sandwiches which are remarkably good and an excellent value at $5-6 eachI try to stop in everytime I'm in the area and I think you should too.
1414,1,I have to admit I am not a big fan of waiting in lines I have to say that this was some of the best mexican food I have ever had It was worth the wait Their service was great I have lived in AZ for 20 + years and have never heard of this place wow I will definately be going back.
1372,1,I love this place It's great for a quick meal if you're shopping or if you work in the area and are on lunch break I HIGHLY HIGHLY recommend the Chopped Turkey salad I get it a couple times a week and with very good reason:Perfectly portioned and well-priced it's filled with chopped turkey Vermont Cheddar hard-boiled eggs crispy lettuce cherry tomatoes and corn I prefer it with the Cowboy Ranch dressing but there's also a vinaigrette option All that for just under $6I've gotten the sliders a couple times - they are delish and sized just right for what they are I know if I am craving a big juicy burger I can go hit up Johnny Rocket's in the mall or better yet Five Guys when it opensThis was a great concept and it's very nice that it's not trying to be something it's not Take-out is obviously what the aim is here as seating is limited.
584,1,Fresh food.
2272,1,You can get a 3-ounce taster of any of the beers on tap for $1 or $2 each I went with a group of friends and we tried ALL THE BEERS It is a night that will live on in the annals of history I highly recommend it as an adventure a group bonding activity and an opportunity to discover new beers you likeThe food is mighty tasty I've had sweet potato fries at a lot of places and these are hands-down the best They're a little on the salty side but that's how I like them If only they offered them with Delux's aioli then we'd be in business We also got a meat & cheese plate and the grilled chicken flatbread pizza They were both quite tasty and disappeared quicklyOur server was great We were a big group and it would be easy to mess up with all of those tasters But he got everything right and checked in with us regularly It also didn't hurt that he was a cutey patooteyThe only con was that we were seated in an alcove with two booths and it got really loud with all the sound bouncing around I wish they'd put up a curtain between the booths and something on the walls to dampen the sound For now I'll just ask for a different table.
4256,0,Its almost a crime to call this Hawiian foodthe mac salad had zero flavor the bbq chicken was marginal at best and the pineapple chicken sauce was gross the only reason they get 1 star is because the white rice was good and sticky very unsatisfying.

1474,1,"After passing this place on recent visits to Culinary Dropout and Olive and Ivy my girlfriend and I finally decided to give Wildfish a try in our efforts to collect the whole Waterfront set  We arrived around 8:30 on a Saturday night with reservations made on Opentable and were seated immediately with our choice of table or booth  My first impression of our corner booth was that it was a little TOO dark but no big deal  Our server arrived quickly gave us a choice of waters (I went with the standard hydrogen dioxide) and proceeded to be very pleasant and helpful throughout the evening  My gf had a glass of wine and we ordered the crabcake appetizer to which our server replied ""Good choice That's my FAVORITE""  For entrees my gf went with scallops and I narrowed it down to swordfish or an Australian fish whose name i can't remember  I asked the server for her recommendation and she said the Aussie fish was her FAVORITE (2 for 2)  My fish came topped with crabmeat a rich buttery sauce and sliced grapes The acidity of the grapes provided a nice counterpoint to the sauce just as our server had promised  I also tried my gf's scallops and they were some of the best I've ever had  She agreed giving them a very slight edge over Olive & Ivy's  For dessert we decided to split a creme brulee which amazingly was ALSO our server's FAVORITE  Wow 3 for 3  What are the odds  Okay the first two I was willing to give her but when EVERYTHING i ordered was her FAVORITE THING ON THE MENU it started to feel a little disingenuous  Maybe tone it down a notch  Still I can't knock the service She did a great job and I'd rather have fake than surly any day  For 1 app 2 entrees 1 glass of wine and 1 dessert our tab topped out at $90  Not cheap but definitely reasonable for fresh seafood in the middle of a DESERT  Overall good experience and I'd say 45 stars  They get the lucky roundup to 5."

2913,1,I love this location The people are courteous and friendly and I have never had to wait in line To make a very very very long story short: I am a recent convert to Wells Fargo Tom Quinsler the Branch Manager for this location went out of his way to assist me in the cash purchase of a home Due to the large nature of the transactions my money could have been held for weeks until the bank was certain I was not a terrorist or a thief Tom inserted himself in the situation and allowed me access to my money so that I could meet the date requirements for my home purchase Tom risked a slap on the hand to meet a customers' need and that is customer service that we just no longer see My thanks to Tom and his staff for making what could have been a nightmare into a good experience.
3183,0,Gross I got a combo platter of chicken curry On the menu it had a red pepper next to it meaning to signify that it was spicy but the curry was extremely bland and it looked like greasy water I assume that it is because they have such a thin curry that the dish was served in a cup-shaped fried egg roll wrapper Not only was the sauce a disappointment but the chicken was extremely fatty The fact that it was a combo platter meant that I also received side dishes First of all their fried rice has no egg or veggies in it so it's just soy sauce-soaked salty rice The egg roll was okay although it was the heaviest egg roll I've ever encountered since it was primarily fried wrapper around meager contents There was also a side of horribly MSG-laden lo-mein Finally there were two buffalo wings which I never got to because by that point I was not really wanting to eat any more of their food offeringsFirst bad meal out I've had in a long time (food-wise anyway at least the staff was pleasant) Maybe they have other foods that they are better at making I don't know and won't be back to find out.
1336,1,I stopped by Hard Goods this past weekend after getting some ice cream at Churn As I walked in I tried to figure out what it was Is it a store Is it a galleryWhatever it was it's beautiful Amazing artwork and sculptural home decor line the walls vintage and modern furniture in the back and accessories in a display case in the centerI was greeted by Lucas and expressed my interest and curiosity of what I was walking into As he spoke I took everything in and his words made sense It's a store which carries unique and eclectic works by mostly local artists He explained that the owner of the store is a master concrete craftsman and created the store as means of both an artistic outlet and as a way to support and promote other local artists and designers I never knew that there were so many talented artists and craftsmen in Phoenix While the store has a rather masculine vibe to it there really is something for everyone (well except the beard conditioner that's definitely for men) There are wooden sunglasses and bowties (yes us women can wear them too) leather iPhone sleeve and aluminum iPhone cases soap air plants cast concrete succulents and even concrete feet Then there's the creme de la creme an original Herman Miller Eames chair I've wanted one for so long If only I had an extra $3000 laying aroundI'm so excited to see a new store like Hard Goods in this neighborhood and I can't wait to go back and see what new things are in store for me.

2368,0,Been a patron at Rubio's for a long time this one included This evening had my worst experience ever They were short-staffed which created a) an inordinate wait (25 minutes for two tacos) b) rude/hurried staff c) cold food which ended up making me sick (though it could have just been the unsanitary way it appeared to be made) d) virtually empty salsa bar e) very dirty dining area/tables f) wet tray my food was set on (to his credit the shift manager had to keep running back and forth between the counter and the back throwing on the plastic gloves and making the food then running out to the counter taking the gloves off and delivering the food) and g) angry impatient customers  It was enough to seriously think about never going there again given the number of local establishments that serve just as good/better food  And now that Rubio's prices are so high I can't think of a really good reason to go back.
4750,0,"The last time will be the last time Yesterday at CF waiter was passable He did not offer to bring a glass with the beer and did not do so until asked Food and drinks were good However at end of meal a waitress from another table dropped/spilled a tray of drinks on the left side of my husband who is in a wheelchair with electric wheels Husband's left side including wheels and batteries were drenched Waitress did not initially apologize but stated ""It's just a spill"" We asked several times for a wet cloth to wipe off sticky soda from husband shirt wheelchair and wheels We moved to the next table to finish meal and to get out of the large puddle The manager came over after several minutes and offered to pay for dry cleaning then the waitress said she was sorry No comp no apology until we cleaned up ourselves Even worse two years ago a waiter dropped a tray of drinks on my son at the same placeand another customer who was sitting at a table next to us was also drenched This was weird deja vu  Maybe CF has a policy that waitstaff have to carry as many drinks as possible and they don't know their limit until they exceed it Ha Overall food was good and service was sub par Attitude was LOUSY The customer who is paying about $2500 per person ought to be treated as a guest and with courtesy Better luck when seated at the bar on past visits No spillage."

4626,0,OMG The ambiance is Walmart or casino food court  They have a sign posted with the house rules such that list do not let children run and roam  It's worse than a public park playground  Children roaming and running unsupervised playing in the food and eating from the buffet food tables  I attended on a Saturday night the crowd it attracted was surprisingly one that doesn't know how to act in public  Food scraps all around the floor  Three children raising havoc in the restroom I watched three female young adults sitting together have a altercation and one had to beat on another  This is the crowd this location attracts  The restaurant staff did nothing to intervene in any situation which they list as inappropriate behavior  This location is going to need bouncers to supervise the dining room as well as the parking lot  Not a civil dining experience it doesn't matter what the food quality is.

3135,0,I ordered the teriyaki chicken which is apparently their specialty and priced accordingly  It was $7 for a medium sized bowl and drink  The chicken was mediocre and the rice was kinda gummy  Even still this wouldn't have warranted the one star until I bit into a chunk of bone that they forgot to sift out  Nasty.

1406,1,Took my wife here for her birthday - she'd been wanting to try it for awhile and we'd never been - so I made a reservation and we went  We were definitely not disappointed  The ambiance was very nice and our server was polite attentive and very helpful  The house salad I started with tasted noticeably fresh and was generous in size  My wife had a rotisserie chicken which she really enjoyed  I had their special for the evening a lamb sirloin and I was delicious  Very flavorful and the sides (broccoli and mashed potatoes) were tasty as well - and I'm not usually a fan of broccoli  The evening was topped off by a birthday dessert of a banana/chocolate pie - again delicious  No complaints about the food service or ambiance  Wish we would have found this place earlier and we'll definitely be back  It's risen to the top tier on our list of Scottsdale restaurants  Highly recommended.
1090,1,Went to Joe's last night  Not my first time at all but my first time seeing the expansion and it looks AMAZING  I love it  The place looks amazing the employees are always so nice and are so helpful and friendly and the bands (especially Money Shot) are awesome  I HIGHLY recommend going to Joes  It is a great place to make your usual hang out.
1870,1,"Most of my reviews for Asian restaurants in Phoenix begin with something like ""it's goodfor the area"" but this place is just plain good I'm a pretty serious Thai food snob and--even when I lived in Chicago--I only frequented a handful of Thai placesThat being said I'm definitely going to be a repeat customer at Wild ThaigerMy husband and I gave it a try for Dining out for Life when our first choice had a long wait I've never been so happy I couldn't get a table somewhere We sat outside on their patio which I would recommend to anyone It's open yet cozy and comfortably cool For our appetizer we had the seafood pancake I've never had anything like it but the description sounded too good to pass up It's a crispy pancake full of sprouts scallions shrimp mussels and squid It was delicious and really unique For dinner I ordered the Decha Boar The description listed it as being perfect for the ""true Thai foodie"" With a description like that I had to order it The dish was spicy and flavorful I'd caution anyone not familiar with Thai food that it might be a bit too spicy for you even if you like spicy foods Different chiles effect people differently My husband ordered the Ginger Fish The sauce on the fish was like liquid crack I could've taken a bath in it Long story short: it was SO good I'll definitely be back to try some of their other menu items They have a smaller menu compared to most Thai places and I believe this allows them to focus on perfecting a few dishes instead of doing lots of mediocre things with Thai flavors Check this place out."
2679,0,Service this morning was abysmal I changed locations this morning running late in hopes that the drive-thru would be more speedy Yeah rightThe line moved painstakingly slooooowwwww When I got my coffee it was barely 2/3 full and the rest was all whipped cream I ordered a Venti Vanilla Latte I'm not going to pay five dollars for a cup full of whipped cream I wanted the coffee Last time I visit this location.
2933,1,I love foodI had the steak roll ups and some potato salad  Steak tips had mushrooms and carmelized onions in them and this delicious dipping sauce that I kinda felt like drinking it was so dang good  The coolest coke machine ever is here (we need some in Text) it is a touch screen coke machine I was watching th people in front of us do it first so I didnt feel too stupid taking my turn  It was way coolwish I would have gotten a picture  The area is great next will have to try a different place in same areaThey also have pictures up around the entire restraunt that were drawn by kids at the Childrens hospital was a very cute touch.
2741,0,"I went to this place a couple days ago to have my kids flats fix  The guy at the front seemed nice and professional (at the beginning) one I approach him with my request he stopped me and ask me ""did you put fix-a-flat in the tires"" I explain to him that my kids had in fact added some into the tires for a quick fix He then said ""get these things out of here I will not touch them or let any of my staff work on your bikes"" I asked him why He said that ""fix-a-flat"" was EXTREMELY toxic and will burn trough his clothes and his hands if he was to touch it  After a few more minutes of trying to understand the bull shit this guy was telling me he grabbed one of the bikes and took it outside him self Very disappointed and I will never recommend anyone to go here for any kind of reason Save the haste and drive the extra 10minutes to the BIKE BARN 36th st and Indian School rd."
1652,1,This place is awesome  They have fun cocktails so make sure to sample a couple  For starters you simply must get the duck fat fries  They are the best I've had and the 110 minute egg they are served with is sooooo good  For dinner our table ordered the lamb burger seared ahi and the slow roasted beef - all entrees were delicious  The lamb burger was my favorite For dessert we had the butterscotch boudino and it was so incredible that I can't wait to go back and have another  We will definitely return.
2580,1,Best coffee everAdd cream & sugar to make it even better.
3191,0,Tick tock tick tock The sound of the countdown till the inevitable closure of this pretentious shithole Don't get me wrong: I'm not going to write a review lambasting the evils of a $400 made-in-China t-shirt For a girl as into gross consumerism as I one would think Barney's would represent the ultimate altar at which to worshipThat said I still work hard to earn every damn penny and still expect a certain level of service at this price point I will tell you that the customer service at my ghetto Target is heads and shoulders superior to that of Barney's I have walked in with photos of an item knowing they carry the designer and asked them to find it for me They take my number and email and smile and nod but then crickets I attempt to return a defective handbag (GASP) past the sacred 30-day window in which returns are accepted Much hemming and hawing and excuses and the bag is surrendered mysteriously sans refund with promises of a call from the manager Again crickets I have to stalk the handbag department to see how the Queen Manager has deigned to handle my quandary (for those dying to know they sent the bag back to the manufacturer for repair without telling me) I walk through the shoe department clearly lingering over a certain item and crickets I can see a sullen young man with waxed eyebrows giving me the side eye from the back room but crickets Is it me It's not Foot Locker for fuck's sake I'm not going to wave the shoe at him from across the room and holler out my size Sorry I'm not sure why the staff goes MIA I'm certain that gossiping and doing each other's makeup does not take up a disproportionate chunk of their workday I'm not 18 (read: will not make you bring out every shoe for me to try on for fun) and I'm carrying the same bag you're selling 20 feet away (read: have AMEX/will shop) so I'm not really sure what else I need to do to get some damn helpAdditionally against my better judgement I also sent my poor SO here to have all his suits and grown-up stuff altered when he lost weight and decided he wanted to pretend he was a J Crew model I figured the average tailor was not going to be on the cutting edge (heh) of this season's suit cut but surely of-the-moment Barney's tailor would Sadly the seamstress while perfectly friendly and competent had just as many challenges with English and as little knowledge of trends as the $10-hem-while-you-wait place on the corner The only difference was that the changing room was fancier -- she still needed an excess amount of direction when we came to her hoping she would have the expertise to run the show Sorry Barney's I realize you carry a lot of niche labels and items not otherwise available in retail locations in this state In the golden age of the Interwebs though your benefit of exclusivity is gone Now who wants to place bets on what store will fill their empty space.
3352,0,The sad part is I USED to give them a 5 star rating I USED to tell my friends and family to go there I USED to love them so much But here is what they have been doing the last few appointments and I just can't stand it You make an appointment with the hygienist you have come to love and respect This person was like a friend and you didn't even mind getting your teeth cleaned and I HATE the dentist But now what they do is make you see a tech first So now your talented and wonderful hygienist only comes in for the last 5 minutes and cleans up their work My experience was the tech was no where near as gentle and calming I HATE IT HATE IT HATE IT HATE IT I make an appointment and drive 20 miles to see the HYGIENIST not a tech I am so very very heart broken I am currently looking for a new dentist I am going to miss them so very much but if I only get to see the hygienist for 5 minutes it is not worth it I am back to being scared to go to my appointments and stress over them for days I just wish they would go back to how it was.
249,1,It was great the food the service and the ambiance  Definately will go back again.
3472,0,Ok for manicures Staff is unfriendly and talk about the customers in foreign tongue      My recent pedicure was horrible because the tech was digging into one of my nails Ouch.
1210,1,"Order in drive through this place is the go to in Arcadia for a great burger (ok I didn't mean to make that rhyme)  They ""get"" great customer service and always ask for my name when I order even in the drive throughI haven't had a chance to try a shake yet mostly because I save my calories for a Standard with Cheese and fries  They are also always happy to modify my burger as I am not a lettuce tomato onion fanOnly gripe is they use a lot of pepper on both the burger and on the fries  I like well seasoned but the beef is amazing and flavorful so no need to add anything else  Same with the fries salt is all you need."
2373,1,Seriously I'm glad I don't live in Arizona or I'd weight 400 pounds I had wings here every Tuesday night for wing nightI was down in Arizona in 2008 and it was my first stopyeah you heard menot to see friends who I missedit was I'm going to Native see you there with my wings and beerseriously I think I'm drooling while writing this reviewI've never had anything else on their menu just the wingsit's all about the wings and beerlots of wings and beer WINGS AND BEEEEER and I wonder why I gained 20 pounds.
1165,1,Another great Pat's Run One of the best t-shirts I've ever gotten from a run before too Sold-out again this year but somehow it seemed a little more organized and let people know what to expect Three water stations along the route and water bananas and oranges at the end There were also some outside sponsors there handing out freebies-I did have a refreshing smoothie from jamba juice Cool finish line inside Sun Devil stadium that's probably the best part Along with being there with all those thousands of people for a great cause.
4918,0,It seems like a great deal I came here for the MLK weekend special It was $1795 for all you can play bowling laser tag etc what they don't tell you is that you will spend 2+ hours waiting to play any of the games So in the end you spend the whole night there and only get to play 1 or 2 games of anything Essentially it's a huge rip off Might as well just go to a bowling alley or laser tag place I won't be coming back for sure Also the service here is atrocious You will spend 15+ minutes at the bar just waiting to get a beer.
880,1,This is the best bike shop hands down in the Phoenix area  They are professional and I always get great customer service  They stick to their word even when things come out slightly more expensive than they said  They never pressure you.
442,1,Classy Organic Healthy delicous Everything is supeb and this is reflected in the HIGH prices Great place to go if you have 40 dollars each for dinner Best Organic restaurant I have ever been to Highly recomend the fire grilled salmon the palmagranite Lemonade the Tapas the Hummus the salads EVERYTHING IS GREAT.
3639,0,I sat for 8 minutes without being greeted by the waiter no drinks were offered I left after expressing my dissatisfaction to the hostess Thanks for the terrible service.
1696,1,Glass Creations is one of the most beautiful stores Not only does it have beautiful glass but they also specialize in beads purses and art Owners are extremely friendly and helpful A great place to buy gifts or something for yourself They always have the latest in holiday trends Bought my first Christmas gift here and plan on going back.
3075,1,A variety of delicious beers friendly staff and a not too busy atmosphere What more could you want Oh you're hungry Yeah well there's a food truck outside too This tasting room is seriously the only thing from our whole weekend in the Phoenix area that made me sad that I'm not a localWe came in the night before the Rock and Roll Half Marathon with the intent of having a beer each and then ended up trying pretty much everything they offer because it was so affordable everything was tasty and we just didn't want to leave I drank MANY IPAs over the years I lived in Seattle and I think their American IPA is one of my favorites - heavy on the hops without being too citrusy I definitely woke up the next morning thinking I should have had more water and less beer the previous evening but beer has carbs which must be good for running rightThey had a couple of TVs and tons of board games along with a little outside area to sit We opted for outside and because it's in a business park it was super quiet which was perfect and not what you expect for going out on a Saturday evening for a beer Four Peaks you're my favorite thing in all of Arizona for sure.
707,1,Great guy knows his stuff.
159,1,Need a boba tea house in north Phoenix or Scottsdale Always quick service and tasty cold drinks I always get the strawberry slush perfect for the Phoenix summer days.
936,1,Well couldn't help it gotta bump this up to a perfect five stars after our last visit Our first visit we tried every taco on the menu this time we tried a quesadilla an Oaxacan Black Mole Burro and for good measure a regular old bean burrito because we wanted to try their beans On top of that I just had to get another 'Dogfish Shark' taco because it was my favorite and instead of the Horchata we tried their Jamaica drinkmmm The quesadilla was very different made with a really thick corn tortilla with sour cream drizzled all over it damn good Perfect to tear pieces off of and dip in the different salsas The two burros we tried were equally tasty and just like last time the chips were spot on What's not to love about this place It's just one of those 'easy to fall in love with' little holes in the wall I think I'd give just about anything for them to start selling their salsa's to-go especially after our last visit and finally being able to try the much talked about strawberry salsa it really is as good as everyone says it is heaven in a sauce basically Whoever the mad scientist is behind these salsas really deserves a pat on the back because I'm hooked From what I've been hearing this place is slowly starting to get busier and busier it puts a smile on my face to see good food and good businesses succeed based on word of mouth In my ideal world there'd be a La Condessa on every other corner instead of a Taco Bell eh baby steps I guess 5/5.
1799,1,"Dear God in Heaven there is a burrito here called ""The Beast"" that is hands down the best burrito I've ever eaten I'm not kidding WOW Also the quesadilla with chicken was pretty much the second greatest thing I've ever eaten A little pricey Sure Worth it I'd say so."
4454,0,Have to give one star to post but doesn' deserve that high a rating Avoid this dealership for service I placed three calls to the service department with no return calls Obviously they are not in need of business Was completely satisfied with service by Larry Miller Hyundai in Peoria Will use that service from now on.
480,1,This is one of my favorite new restaurants  I have been there 3 times now and everything I have ordered there has been really good  They have such a variety of great foods (pizza pasta sandwiches calzones etc) and very high quality  And I have never had an issue with their service  I even went once with a group of 22 people from work and they did a great job handling our enormous partyI can't wait to go back to try something else.
2909,1,They have relocated to the Biltmore Shopping Mall at 24th Street and Camelback  Yay  They serve wine or coffee with chocolate candies or cakes in a sit-down cafe and they sell custom-boxed candies or ready made and wrapped gift boxes  Their chocolates have a distinctive flavor different than Godiva or Ghirardelli (sp)  I don't usually like creamy chocolates but theirs are an exception for me  The cakes I have tried are top shelf Yum  I have not had the wine  The coffee is rather good (says the Starbucks gold card holder) It's a fun venue when recharging after a movie at AMC across the street and before taking home an adorable pet from Petique or a new Coach bag (less responsibility in the latter case) or a British cruiser bike.
783,1,So I had a pair of sunglasses that need some major tweaking (the kind of stuff I couldn't do myself) and these guys did it for free even though I was clear that I did not buy them there  When I offered to pay something for their effort they just asked that I keep them in mind when I buy in the future  I will most definitely do that.
4276,0,Lasy nite we were there about 7 pm It so incredibly LOUD I had to yell to be heard over the noise I ordered the A1 pepercorn burg and my girlfriend ordered the `prime rib sandwich There was no silverware when our food got to usThe waitress said all the utensils were dirty or havent come out of the dishwasher  My girlfriends sandwich and the coleslaw on her plate was warmslaw should be cold She bit into the sandwichhad a funny look on her face and pulled out a broken toothpick The toothpicks that were in her sandwich originally were not broken The manager was informed about this and picked the entire check upbut we would never go back there.
3368,0,This pizza is HORRIBLE  I just moved to AZ from Chicago and am a pizza fanatic Definitely need some Giordano's pizza in AZI don' t think i could take this lol Maybe it is bc i am used to good pizza living in Chicago but people told me i had to try this pizza when visiting arizona What a mistake  I waited an hour for a table of 5 We ordered fried calamari as an appetizer That was by far the worst i've ever had It wasn't even real calamari The oil they used was garbage And then we ordered a thin pizza and a stuffed pizza Again i have never had worse of either style pizza  I went home and threw a Tombstone frozen pizza in the oven I was really excited to eat this Oregano's pizza and it was very disappointing Maybe i had too high of expectations And maybe i am used to eating good pizza like Giordano's.
3125,0,AVOID MEAT DEPARTMENTBad Service Poor quality seafood and meatsManager does not offer any helpGood Produce sale on WedDo not expect any customer service from Meat Dept and Store Manager.
1748,1,Can't wait to go back  I love the Monday deal it is genius  I was there with my twin mom group (about 12 moms of twins) we had a blast  I love the Brie Apple and Fig Prosciutto Fig and mascarpone Tomato jam bruschettas  I had the Teira Zinfandel which was perfect.
3237,0,We used to go to Taylor Cafe all the time but haven't been in a while  Man what a difference- and not in a good wayIt is unseasonably cool in Phoenix and Vincent's isn't having their brunch experience so we decided to go back to Taylor Cafe  There were several less than pleasant surprises  First off they no longer have a liquor license and thus no Mimosas or Bloody Marys  That was a minor issue for us but worth mentioning on a Saturday morning brunch  I ordered a cup of coffee some scrambled eggs with cheese for my hungry toddler and we looked at the menu  It seemed to have gotten much larger and there were some new interesting items  I loved the eggs benedict before and ordered it again  My husband ordered the crepes  We anticipated our mealsMy daughter's eggs came out almost within seconds  Shocked I saw it wasn't just eggs but hashbrowns and fruit  It was also NOT warm  That surprise was a $9 mealWhile waiting for our meal I drank most of my coffee  The server asked if I'd like more coffee to heat up my cup  He took my cup which I though was odd and brought it back with warm steaming coffee  Yay  Upon getting the bill I learned there was no such things as refills and I was charged for a second cup  Lastly our food was delivered  My eggs benedict was not warmagain  What is with cool food  There wasn't enough hollandaise sauce and honestly it just wasn't that tasty  My husband thought his crepes were just ok- not bad but not flavorful  Our last surprise:  when the bill arrived and we spent $45 on at best a mediocre breakfast we were less than pleasedThe only bright spot- our server was friendly and did his best  We will not go back  This was just one disappointment after another.
355,1,Zia is a great place Service is good and not pushy Prices are fair to cheap Nice atmosphere and variety It's where I buy all my movies and CDs.
1918,1,Da bomb.
4089,0,I use to come here all the time it's my first time back in a year the bartenders have NO personality and rude they just want their tip and ignore the customers I will give it another year before I go back It's sad they hired these pricks.
1878,1,Yum Another wonderful evening at Amano's Great food friendly staff and in case you didn't know Tuesday is 1/2 off bottle wine night We shared a fabulous Cabernet from their Great selection Hmmm See you next Tuesday.
4224,0,We always have enjoyed going to Olive Garden in the past and this experience really changed my opinion of Olive Garden all together We came here for dinner on a Saturday evening and really were looking forward to having a great experience as always The bread-sticks are tasty the salads and soups are always a pleasure to try since they seem to always have new ones coming out from time to time But my issue is with the management and because of that our experience has tarnished Olive Garden in our eyes Our server comes over and asks us for drinks I have a glass of wine and my husband has a Italian margarita We order our app and  a salad and my husband finishes his margarita and our server asks him if  he would like another He agrees and asks her to order in another shot of tequila because the first margarita was a little light She says okay and when she comes back with his margarita following right behind her is the Manager and asks him why he wants an additional shot he explains and the GM then goes on long explanation on why they cant add additional shots in the drink and said moving forward tonight we are not going to be serving you any more alcoholic drinks I was shocked Two drinks and you are cut off Maybe the manager was having a bad day or maybe they only let you order two drinks But this coming from a place where they are always pushing their wine and always go as far to leaving you a whole jug of it at your table this came off as a little odd  My husband is a good sized man and two drinks and cut off I thought was a little too much Most importantly this was rude and unprofessionalThis ruined our evening and it was very difficult for us to take anything positive from this Since our order was in we waited for our entrees ate them paid the bill and left I can honestly say that we are never coming back to Olive Garden in the future I went online the next day and filled in the contact us questionnaire so that we could be contacted by someone at corporate and let someone know how not to treat customers that have been so loyal for so many years now but to this day I have yet to be contacted back not an email or a call What a disappointment where customer service goes such a long way Apparently not to Olive Garden.
1374,1,On a Sunday morning  we took in 80lbs of laundry because we didn't have a laundry room They were amazing And got it done in 8 hours Very clean place and super nice people Totally recommend them.
2809,1,Check it out The power of Yelp I got this message from a former coworker who read my Yelp on Facebook: Hey Dallas - wanted to thank you for the Back to Basics reminder Taking my car there rather than the dealership saved me almost a grandTHAT'S what I'm talking about My little words A little reminder to someone about a solid little car shop and she saves $1000 FTW.
1771,1,Zipps One of the Valley's best happy hour if you're looking for a laid-back atmosphere I really enjoy the layout of this locationA 32-ouncer and Golden Medium wings are a must But don't underestimate the strong margaritas Yummy Burgers and AMAZING foccacias A great sports bar to watch the bigger games NFL NBA MLB and college Although my boyfriend and I feel that there are too many U of A fans (GO DEVILS).
4760,0,Went in at about 30 minutes before they closed with my friend Most workers already seemed checked out already and not paying much attention They almost seemed annoyed we were thereWe had a simple order that they seemed very confused about and unsure how to execute They then told me they were out of the soup i wanted so i asked for a different one Then after waiting for another minute or two a manager comes out to inform me that they were out of the second soup as well This wasnt a problem they just took forever to inform me of an easily solvable problem Then After being rang up they had forgotten to give us our breadbowl and an order of mac and cheese Overall it was a really unnecessary ordeal.
575,1,"My husband and I went here for our wedding anniversary I let him choose the restaurant because I hadn't gotten him a gift and he did take me to the Josh Groban concert and dinner 3 nights before I was initially disappointed because I am not fish person unless it is shellfish even though we had eaten here before and enjoyed it  My disappointment went right out the window the moment we were seated  They had asked when I made the reservations if it were a special occasion and I told them it was our anniversary There was an anniversary card on the table with fresh rose petals strewn over the cloth A real class act but it gets even better We both had the Maine lobster and shrimp bisque - very smooth and rich in flavor My husband had the Chilean Sea Bass which may make me say I really do like fish other than shellfish Cooked to perfection generous portion and mild with a little crunch on the outside I had the Jumbo white Gulf shrimp with Jonas crab meat which is where my problem came in because my palate does not tolerate pepper heat and generally I will ask even when something looks innocuous on the menu I have had meals at other places where they decide to finish the dish with red pepper flakes and have ruined my whole meal since it is not mentioned anywhere  Someone who likes heat would have loved it When the waiter asked what we thought I mentioned that I had made a big mistake and did I miss something on the menu Apparently it had some kind of chili oil on it  I was not expecting anything my bad but the next thing we knew the manager came over  He offered to recook the meal without the oil but I had already eaten 3 shrimp and told him it was my bad they could just wrap it and my hubby would eat the leftovers Instead he said he would comp us a round of drinks  Again class act In addition to the entrees we ordered two small sides to split (plenty) We had spinach sauteed with garlic and Parmesan cheese plus the crab fried rice with scallions and mushrooms  The rice was out of this world and the leftovers came home with the shrimpThey gave us a choice of complimentary dessert to share and we choose the molten lava cake with vanilla ice cream  I quickly took my half of the ice cream before my husband took it all  The cake was absolutely decadent oozing rich chocolate  It needed the ice cream to cut it so I am glad I took my 1/2 right awayAgain all in all great food and excellent customer service  More places should follow this example  The impression they left with us made me immediately say ""I am going to yelp them and give them a 5""  Kudos to you Wildfish."
1667,0,"3rd stike I will never return to this location This is the third and final time I will set foot in this location Todays encounter was by far the worst My mother called in a to go order because she figured it would be busy When my son arrived we stood at the door as there were several people waiting to be seated I received a text from my mother informing me that it would be an hour for the order to be ready I looked around and there were several empty tables in the middle of the room 2 empty booths along the window and the banquest room was empty I approached the counter and asked the hostess if it was really going to take an hour to get a to go She replied yes we have people sitting at tables that havent had their orders filled in 30 mins or more i directed her sight to the multiple open tables and asked for an explanation She said ""OBVIOUSLY WE'RE BUSY"" I then asked to speak with the manager whom happened to be walking up I stepped to the side to address the manager I informed the manager that this was my 3rd attempt at getting a to go order I explained that my family and I go to the Scottsdale location very often From the start the manager was very condescending I informed him of my most recent visit to simply get dessert(Which on that visit I was informed that they were'nt doing to go orders because it slows down the kitchen But they would see if they could get me a slice of cake) After explaining my frustration to the manager his reply was simply ""oh well"" while staring blankly into my face I asked the manager for his name which he gladly offered while extending his hand ""I'M LARRY WHITE THE OWNER I AM LoLo' Raising his voice and gripping my hand as if to intimidate me I shook his hand as he squeezed like we were at some stand off in the playground childish attempt to display authority I politely informed Mr White that there was no need to attempt aggression and raise his voice I reminded him that I was calm and the tone in my voice had not changed AND I would appreciate it if he would not attempt to disrespect me in front of my 4yr old by raising his voice to me I thanked Mr White and requested that he cancel my mothers to go order request As mentioned my family and I are loyal patrons of the Scottsdale location It is really sad that the level of service is not the same But here is a suggestion maybe if your kitchen staff cannot handle the level of business that you do HIRE MORE STAFF Or better yet turn down the music and have the DJ help out It's a restaurant not a night club But I am not a Business Major so maybe I don't know from what I speak."
472,1,I was at church this Sunday morning when I had a craving for Pho I went on my yelp app and put it pho near South Phoenix About 4 miles away was Rice PaperIt's always scary to try something new but after checking out a few reviews I figured it was worth trying and I even brought 6 other friends who also loved it (some never had Vietnamese before)My order: - Traditional bowl of Pho                  - Pork Crispy Spring RollsMy friends ordered: Banh Mi (viet sandwiches) Here is the reviewPros: - Pho was tasty and cleaner than most Pho places           - Decor of the place was very chic           - There is a bar (for you drinkers)           - The banh mi were HUGE and came with garlic or sweet potato fries           - Nice outdoor patio for when its cooler outside           - The head server was very helpfulCons: - Price was a little more than most pho places (Pho: $10 / Rolls $350-$5)            - Spring rolls were pricey for one spring roll or two cut up fried pieces to make four            - Parking lot was smallabout 12 spaces            - The restaurant is about the size of a house so even though we had a group of 7 I don't know if i'd bring that big of a group next time            Conclusion: Check this place out It's intimate and I'm glad they're open later than most restaurants Pricey but hey sometimes you gotta pay to have something nicer.
4168,0,2bmod was one of the stores I visited on my journey to find the perfect sofa The place is a bit difficult to find so be prepared to get lost a few times When I got there I had my mind set on a particular sofa The gentleman working there showed me a few swatches and then suddenly went in the back to take a phone call--and never came back Two other people came in and we all waited After about 15 minutes they finally left and so did I I still love their furniture but I won't be buying it anytime soon It's too bad their customer service was off that day.
4784,0,I no likeI thought the atmosphere was awful  Too bright and hospital like for my tastesI thought the staff was incredibly snotty inept and downright rudeI thought the wine selection left a lot to be desiredIt was cheap because it was happy hour  We got the cheese plate only to discover that the cheeses were from Trader Joes cheese section and were rather commercial and blahIt also came with sliced pepperoni  Pepperoni  ReallyI just didn't like itWhich is truly a shame because I was hoping it could become my new wine happy hour staple   But alas I'll keep searching.
2033,1,This is a beautiful and great grocery store/ deli I would compare this store to a Bristol Farms maybe Everything was clean and put together really well We were greeted by one employee who asked us if we wanted a wine tasting and so we did and we were happy to find out thetasting was free Awesome I came out of his store really wishing we had one in californa in my neighborhood Next time I'm in AZ I'll shop here again.
484,1,With its finely appointed decor resembling a pub straight out of Dublin the Skeptical Chymist is a visual funhouse offering sanctuary to the pub-goer looking for something different A large chalkboard behind the bar lists a wide variety of handcrafted brews with alcohol contents ranging from five to the much higher ten percent range typically found in double IPA's I'm pleasantly surprised with each visit to see the constantly changing offerings Their happy hour menu features five dollar flatbreads that are absolutely scrumptious But the piece de resistance is their corned beef and cabbage a true delight with its perfectly cooked cabbage and  generous portion of corned beef slathered in a mustard onion demi-glace Kudos to our server who was quick to forewarn how the dish comes with a 'gravy' for had she not done so I'm certain I would have been repulsed upon seeing my corned beef smothered in a brown gravy At first we were both confused our thoughts swimming around the idea of how gravy could add anything to corned beef But this gravy is different They call it gravy but it's an onion based demi glace with a slight hint of deli mustard which if you can believe accents the corned beef into a culinary triumphOne IPA and a plate of corned beef for lunch and I found myself flat on the couch an hour later sleeping Sunday afternoon away like a newborn as Sundays are meant to beDuring the week the Chymist is a fun retreat from work with its all ages crowd cigar-friendly patio and extremely fair happy hour pricesThe Chymist is a great place to unwind or have a fine meal that in no way resembles typical bar food  I should probably mention how I've yet to find an unfriendly server or slow service That's not to say the service is somewhat slower when packed but if you're there to pound brews instead of enjoying the moment you'll likely disagree with this reviewOverall nice job SC management.
2701,1,I work in the same dying business park as AGE in Phoenix Walked over said i need a new windshield Curtis gave me a quote Called them a week later best price in town next day FIVE STAR installation no gimmicks excellent service is what they do I have had a few windshields replaced and this was by far the fastest cleanest and top notch install The last guy did not do a very good job replacing the molding on the windshield and i thought i wood have to buy new moldings nope dood was able to fit them in perfectly and looks excellentThis company really is Auto Glass EXCELLENCE.
198,0,I'm pissedI went here on a Thursday night at 9pm looking for dinnerI was so psyched after reading reviewsAnd BOOOThey stop serving food at 9pmSighSo yeah I'm pissed at them  I work late most nights and do end up eating out around 9pmWhy  WHYBooo.
4686,0,Food not worth the wait Stood in line for 50 minutes just to order Saw the (presumably) owner headed out for the day stop and chat with some people in front of us in line Mentioned just how busy they have been Saw the obviously long line and didn't do anything to address the situation Yep the entire time only one of their two order windows was open One  I guess I'm the sucker and the joke's on me.
1463,1,Came here when I was in Scottsdale for Spring Training We were craving Mexican food and this was the closest place to our hotel so Los Olivos it is The Chips and Salsa were brought to our table as soon as we sat down chips were very fresh thin and crispy They served the chips with 2 canister-type things of salsa They were both very good but I liked mixing the two it made for one damn good salsa My dad was in the drinking mood so he ordered a pitcher of Margaritas and man oh man that was a great way to get our meal started For dinner I ordered the Pollo a la Queso Crema a flour tortilla filled with chicken then fried and lastly topped with a seasoned cream cheese and melted cheeses This meal was phenomenal The seasoned cream cheese gave this just enough tanginess along with all the savory aspects the chicken has Thinking about this makes my mouth water and wonder if Los Olivos delivers to Northern CaliforniaNext year when I am back in Scottsdale this will be my first stop as soon as my plane lands and the last place I go before I head to the airport to come home AWESOME FOOD Good wait staff Wouldn't change a thing about this place.
1766,1,First time here came on a Sunday night for dinner The inside is fairly small but cozy They have a large patio dining area with nice lights up but it's too cold for that so no one was out there They have some interesting menu items that I've never seen before My husband and I got the fig and panela cheese salad the hibiscus enchiladas (yep the flowers) and the huitlacoche crepas which is apparently a type of mushroom or fungus that grows on corn Sounds like we eat weird stuff huh Maybe so The salad had nice bite-size pieces of dried figs and cheese with a balsamic dressing The hibiscus enchiladas had a sweet/tangy flavor to them with a nice side of sauteed vegetables The crepas were soft and tangy with goat cheese and pomegranate sauce I was impressed by all three  They also bring out chips with two types of salsa Good service as well.
149,1,Abe just open another location on North 7th Street  Really honest and considerate man  Have you every went to a auto mechanic place and he has candles and a spread of food out  Car wash oil change and etc.
531,1,Staff was more than helpfull I felt like it was a great value if you like great khans you will love this place way more of a variety food was delicious I wish there was one in san diego.
2794,1,Very small place but very cozy When it's busy it's tough to find a place to plant myself One time on a First Friday night they opened up the backyard and was serving brews there and lots of open space There's occasionally bands playing therelove the fact that they serve Delirium Very glad to have found the lost leaf.
1537,0,The fact this place is never open during the weekend is bizarre for a bakery Also the fact that I cant even go in before 8 am weekdays is even more bizarre to me I used to work at safeway bakery and they were workin from 11pm-7pm the next day So the fact this place is not open before 8am or after 5 is quite bothersome so i will never be able to see if this place is even decent.
1668,0,The rooms are nice but my property was stolen from my room 1 Wacom tablet and mouse1 button down shirt (yes a shirt)  only noticed the shirt missing then when I returned home noticed that my Wacom tablet was missing as I needed to edit some images I only had one bag for my trip so it was always with me (it's a messenger bag) Waiting to hear back from the hotelif it's not what I want to hear then I'll file a policy report I fault myself for not noticing right away but I've never ever had this happen to me before Not good times.
2409,1,We've been going to Dr Welch's office for 6 years now and as long we are living here we won't switch Dr Welch is really kind and caring and knows how to speak to children on their level and their office staff is really nice as well Dr Welch isn't just a nice pediatric dentist but it's very obvious that he's a great boss too He takes great care of his staff and their happiness in their workplace shows as they interact with his patients I'm really surprised there aren't more reviews on here yet You won't be disappointed in choosing this practice for your children's dentist :-).
392,1,WowThis was a damn good burgerStaff was very niceplace was spotlessI will be back.
4539,0,This place is terrible It smells like rotten food and looks old and dirty The woman who runs the shop is rude She will also lie to you about how quickly she can have your clothes ready This happened to me twice and unfortunately I was really depending on her to have my dress ready I will never go back.
2903,0,Update: They asked for my number to contact me about my experience  No call after a week.
827,0,Horrible placeI believe I saw Linda MacConnell  I was also put in a room and waited and waited someone from the staff opened the door and said I was put in the wrong room  Dr MacConnell laughed at the reason why I was there didn't give the medication I needed  I now I have ER bills thxs to her and a month and half has gone by based on her bogus findings  $45  to lie on a table and fall backwards to see my reflexes for 2 minutes what a joke.
2131,1,I'm somewhat against Yelp reviews but this place is too great to not say anything Revolver Records is a gem Great and comprehensive selection with amazing prices Pleasing selection for y'all hard rock and heavy 70s freaks I bought eight records here: Atomic Rooster (Made in England) Alice Cooper (Easy Action & Killer) Deep Purple (Fireball) Uriah Heep (very 'evy very 'umble & Salisbury) and SLEEP (Holy Mountain AND Dopesmoker)--all for 100 bucks Those Sleep records are hard to find and priced expensively everywhere else I've looked Over 100 bucks a pop online I also spied some cheap Bloodrock and Judas PriestAdditionally the guys working here are real nice Thanks for making my trip to PhoenixOh and I forgot to mention the sweet pin collection by the counter A bundle of KISS ones too.
3966,0,Awful experience when there was a problem with the pump after I swiped my credit card  I tried to use the pump but it was stuck or something and didn't work so I went inside and asked the clerk to cancel the transaction because I was going to try another pump  He said there was no transaction to cancel  I went to another pump and as I was pumping my gasoline another person pulled up and I could see that she was pumping on my credit card transaction so I went inside and the idiot clerk wouldn't do a thing about it after he told me there was nothing to cancel out  The woman who used my credit card refused to pay me for the gas she stole  Had to get their corporate office involved to get my refund  What a nightmare.
1052,1,Great bloody Mary menu Fun fun place.
4518,0,"I recently had a shit cleaned at the Intercontinental Hotel in Hong Kong Not cheap I only mention that because this place charged MORE to clean that suit - almost $30 for a two-piece suit after they tacked on their $6 ""designer brand"" surcharge (no I am not kidding) Despite branding as ""green"" the suit still reeked of solvent (the green silica-based solvents have never left an odor in my experience) No differentiation to justify these absurd prices - a lot of good alternatives in the area Be warned."
2376,1,Having lived in Italy I normally don't go to Italian restaurants because I don't like to pay for food I can make better and cheaper at home but Miele's is the one place I will go to spend my money The food is great everything down to the bread and the pizza is killer Some people have complained about the prices well you get a lot of food and it is good food I never leave here hungry Also the email specials are a great deal If you like seafood try the seafood risotto it is a tossup between that and the stuffed eggplant as my favorite thing on the menu If you want good real Italian food this is the place if you want all you can eat overcooked pasta and salad for 7 bucks go to Olive Garden.
320,1,"Crudo shattered potato chips deviled eggs meatloaf strawberry basil gin lemonade chocolate pudding rice pudding all of it soooo delicious And that's about half of the smorgasbord I noshed on those are just the favorites that really stuck with me Seriously the most amazing meatloaf I have ever had I never thought I'd use ""amazing"" to describe meatloaf but there you go."
2822,1,Just attended a wedding here and the location was beautiful Tiny little house on the inside but two floors and so incredibly romantic There wasn't anything out of place or too kitschy which was a relief and from the groom's point of view it was priced at a very very good range It was a hipster wedding's dream come true.
3831,0,Average burger old fries and a sad excuse of a milkshake Although the restaurant was super slow the store was very dirty and the employees didn't even bother with it as they preferred to help themselves to free drinks as they conversed amongst themselves.
4720,0,I did not have a good experience at this restaurant at lunch time  I ordered the Cheese Steak Salad with dressing on the side  The salad came and after a few bites I asked the bus boy to get the waitress  The salad was so full of  grease and I was unable to eat it  The waitress came back and said well what do want  I said just bring me a plain small salad  She brings the salad and still charges for the Cheese Steak Salad  Needless to say I will not returnAlso the new addition is beautiful but how do you expect people to sit and eat a full course meal on benchs  Not very comfortable.
293,1,This is a strong Bible directed church There is a real effort made with kids to help facilitate growing up Godly young people My three youngsters love it as much as my wife and I.
3535,0,I stop by and it was a nice place but the prices are a little too high I ordered the shrimp ceviche and it was the blend with no flavor whatsoever I don't think I'm coming back ALTATAS restaurant is the place to go avoid this poor imitation restaurant.
908,1,I'm so glad my hubby and I decided to stop by and check this place out Laura who is one of the owners was very welcoming and pleasant We had a couple of flights and were very pleased The wines Laura carries are very reasonably priced and unique She is very knowledgeable of the wines she has in her shop which makes the experience all that much better.
4694,0,No organic 2% milk which is in the farthest corner of the planet from the entrance because no one would go into a grocery store for just milk rightAnd the cashier couldn't have been any more rude No thank you no smile actually even seemed annoyed that we were disturbing his quiet evening since there were hardly any customers n all were mostly going thru the self checkout.
4245,0,We went there to watch the AFC championship Our waiter was rude and condensing  Food was bad I won't go there again.
453,1,i have eten at Sierra Bonita several times  The food is ALWAYS consistent and some of the best eating in Phoenix  The atmosphere is amazing and service is always top notch  SB has figured out how to be a great neighborhood restaurant with world class food  The style is southwestern with Mexico City influences - truly amazing.
1883,1,I am hard to please  That said I am always elated when I dine at Chipotle--any Chipotle  And since I've been to this location a little more often than the others I choose to review this location  I am amazed at the quality of the meal--fresh ingredients plenty of meat clean interior--modernity at it's best  The prices are ridiculous--six and change for a huge fresh-Mex burrito with steak or chicken or pork  I just wanted to chime in on how much I appreciate 'em.
2549,1,"Wow the ""mamma's spinach"" pizza was really good Garlic spinach & fresh tomatoes was great even 2 days later."
4759,0,I am so disappointedWent there early this evening for a celebratory dinner We walk in and it smells well old The atmosphere is cold and the place is kind of in disrepair They need to just redo the interior designOur server while pleasent did not seem to do the normal things one would expect at a wine barno mention of happy hour specials no mention of wine flights no explanations about the winesit was weird I had to practically interrogate him for information The wine itselfmeh We sampled 6 in a flight and ordered 2 additional glassesThere were a few I did enjoy like the summer peach and the chocolate divine But I think a normal wine drinker would find their wines way (way) too sweet and overall mediocreThe food Now this just makes me mad I ordered the bruschetta sampler and the only one I even half way enjoyed was the blue cheese/grape And while I thought the flavor was good the execution was sloppy I don't like to eat a meal that is not presented nicelyThe grilled shrimp one was NOT grilled or seasoned It was cold and rubbery Like it had been microwaved and left to sit And it was coupled with a bland nasty hummas Ick I spit it into my napkin AwfulThe prosciutto and fig normally one of my favorite combinations was not good They put a bitter lettuce on top which I don't understand and an overpowering sickly sweet sauce It did not work well together at all Crabcake was ok But $7 for a tiny little portion was irritating Look I get that it's tapas but come on it was a bite and a half My husband got the rosemary meatballs which 
3465,0,"This Safeway is THE WORST The lines are always super long the staffing is minimal and not enough to cover the customers shopping and the employees are rude/inappropriate While checking out once the checker and the bagger we're having a political argument and the checker turned to me and asked ""Do you like Obama"" That is not an appropriate questionThe only time I ever shop here is when it is more convenient and I regret my decision every timePlus my son is always disappointed that they don't have any fire truck shopping carts but I'll let him write about that in his own review whenever he learns to talk and write."
4296,0,This place is a joke I have reported to our insurance company for fraud They billed us for lenses we didn't get and also charged our insurance company for a contact lens fitting we paid out of pocket for Save yourself the time and hassle I've been working with our insurance company to get this rectified but honestly what a mess  I will say the exam was thorough but it did take a long time (4+ hours for two of us) It's safe to say we'll be staying far far away from this place.
1737,1,Oh my god Such a wonderful place With tons of options and great service our family went home happy :)Usually we find it tough to find a place with both veg and non veg options plus kids options This one fit perfectly for everyone.
3916,0,"Was very excited to try this place  On a girl's weekend with 6 friends and needed some yummy breakfast food  Got seated immediatley at about 9 on a Saturday morning  Ambiance is cute menu looked great  I have a gluten allergy and was hopeful they would be accomodating seeing as they are a young new place  Not so much  I ordered an eggs benedict dish with veggies on it  I ased for it to be on corn tortillas after our server told me they had no gluten free bread options  I also said no hollandaise sauce on it and the egg cooked well  After MUCH waiting and much speculation that our server did not even actually work for the restaurant because she never brought our drinks and we would see her disappear for long periods behind some door we get our food and mine is literally on one corn tortilla that has been torn in half  It is also covered in sauce  So I say I need to send it back and have it remade with no sauce  She asks ""do you want the sauce on the side"" I say ""no no sauce at all I have an allergy""  So about 10 minutes later once my friends are just about finished I get a plate with the sauce on the sidereally  I go to take a bite and the eggs are barely cooked (thanks for dipping them in warm water before serving them to me)  I now have egg yolk all over the parts that I can eat but now won't because I just don't go there  By now the rest of our table is done and I say take it back take it off the bill  She spends 10 more minutes running around the place with my plate assumingly looking for a manager who never did come apologize because I can only guess they were busy apologizing to other people  It's a cute idea but VERY poorly executed and with a management staff who is very full of themselves and doesn't seem to care about the customer  I say try a different place."
3719,0,I would not recommend this place if it was the last place to stay at We needed a cheap month to month place while we were buying our house no contract  What we should have done was rented a apartment for the four months (we ended up staying two and going to an apartment month to month for the other We were on the ground floor and at night needed to put a towel under the door because of the roach problem not to mention the notice from other guests We got one coffee pouch when we first checked in but When we asked for more they told us no and that the towels were only delivered once a week when they came to clean unless we went to front desk which was fine until our personal towels went missing and were replaced by theirs  They never did find our towels  And insisted we not be there when they cleaned our room Hmm wonder why I'll quit rambling save your money and stay else where or get a cheap month to month apartment.
4456,0,"Since the current ownership has been here my apt has been entered illegally on multiple occasions Their maint staff appears to be quite incompetent as they operate outside of the context of the law and have violated my rights as a tenant in order to ""fix"" things that they could not manage to fix in what has now been more than 60 days and countingYeah Alanza is a cool place to live because of its prime location but when my privacy  and rights are being violated I can't rate higher than one star  I will state that rashonda had been particularly outgoing in her efforts to take control of the chaos that has been my recent experiences here But I am infuriated with being a prisoner to illegal entry of my apt and I will not let these occurrences go unpunished with out a satisfactory resolution or legal action."
2770,1,Okay it is UNBELIEVABLE how much I am in love with this restaurant I was introduced by a friend last year and now I go every chance I get I live in north phx so green is a little further away from me but it is totally worth the drive I've tried basically everything on the menu but my favorite dishes have to be the secret chicken BBQ sandwich and the spicy buffalo wings I used to eat meat but for the past 5 years I have been a vegetarian I used to miss meat but after I found Green I stopped having a craving to eat meat Actually the food at Green is SO MUCH better than any other meats I've had My best friend is a full on meat lover but one day I made her come with me to Green She was a little skeptical at first but to her surprise she absolutely loved it So even if you aren't a vegan or vegetarian this is a must tryoh and a little side note the service is so amazing The employees are so nice and caring You can tell they really love their job Also everything inside the restaurant is recyclable stuff so it is pretty interesting to look around the place while you are waiting for your food.
2652,1,Worth every penny love Pat & Michelle.
2739,1,"Oh Fez  Thank you for being one of my go to places I adore the way you always  provide the best food and super service I have to say when I picked up my oldest girls at the airport and they looked starving  I knew what to give them --FEZ   We love the sweet potato fires and given them the honor of ""best sweet potato fries in the world""  We also loved our waiter Brandon who made us feel like family and even went out of his way to find a food item not on the menu  for the youngest daughterWay to go Brandon --We loved the great service."
2946,0,The Good:  The dispatcher was very friendly and tried to help me out as much as he could 5 stars for himThe Bad:  The tech his name was Sean came over and gave us a quote on a blower motor (that was under warranty) and said it was $700 in labor for a half days work  We said were gonna get another quote and he became rude and said he wouldnt come back if he left  So we got another quote and everyone said this guy is hosing me by about $600 We got two quotes for $100 and another for $300 I now have a guy fixing it within one hours time for $100  Way to hire the winners here I will make sure to warn everyone about this company.
41,0,If there was an option for no stars I would have given that Everybody in here was rude today and just seemed like they had something better to do I should have went next door to five guys At least they like their customers Between the first girl rolling her eyes at me and the cashier rushing us to pay we sure didn't feel very welcome.
475,0,"Although I am impressed with the herb store that is part of this establishment the restaurant leaves a lot to be desiredLet's start with the tables & chairs:  very tiny (like for children's tea parties) and rickety (although it adds to a sense of excitement and paranoia -- to compliment the sense of inferiority they attempt to engender with their ""we will wait on you when we feel like it because we are more elightened about veganism than you"" treatment)  A few of the items that interested my husband on the menu happened to be unavailable and apparently this is not ucommon at Chakra 4 according to some other reviews hereI ordered the watermelon gespacho (sp) which was very goodTheir bread / toast is another matter  It was very hard (think thin patio paver)  Although it was drenched in olive oil I broke the corner of my lower left tooth completely off (I think I must have swallowed it) when biting into it  Since I didn't realize it until about an hour after leaving the restaurant  they would not refund the meal or offer to pay my resulting dental bill  They have a very limited and uncooperative refund policy when it comes to having issues with their food  I think the only way they would have refunded the meal was if I were accompanied by a camera team who filmed the entire meal and the broken tooth incident as well as a forensic team who could analyze the contents of my stomach/bowels for the tooth chip and a cement engineer to test the hardness of their bread/toast versus that of my tooth which doesn't seem cost effective  At least I got my calcium when I swallowed my own tooth chip -- I literally got ""my calcium""If you have any old stale bread that you are considering throwing out or that has sat in the sun for a few days after accidentally being left on your back patio table following a meal outside by all means send it to Chakra 4 so they can then TOAST it then drizzle a little EVOO on it and serve it to their customers -- RECYCLE PEOPLE  But don't expect any sympathy or cooperation if you leave their restaurant with your smile looking like Wil-E-Coyote's after he accidentally missed the Roadrunner and instead bit down on an Acme metal plate."
2138,1,"So being of Hispanic origin & a true AZ Native I would like to think I am somewhat of an authority on Tamales Not really but I know what I like & I have tried them all over town I do believe that these really are the ""Best Ever"" I love the old standby pork tamales but I thought I would give the chicken and  the corn tamale a try They both knocked it out of the park although the Chicken one was"" very"" spicy the blend of green chili chicken & monterey jack cheese was a beautiful palatable combination Then to cool things down I feasted on the corn tamale which was savory yet sweet  I love that they did not sweeten the masa for this delectable treat as I was not looking for a dessert tamale Kudos to the chef now perhaps they could work on the dining room a little Never mind I will probably just get my dozen to go anyways."
1411,1,This place is a great find Friendly service  pet friendly patio reasonable prices and delicious food (we loved the pork & Mahi tacos ).
137,1,Peoria Sports Complex is a great facility for spring training baseball  We went to this ball park on Friday March 4th to see the Reds and Mariners  The best seats in the house are in any section behind the home plate area  We scored two great seats in Section 206 Row 2 just to the right of home plate for only $38  The concession stands have your standard ball park fare  However there are a few independent concession stands where you can buy food items such as indian fry bread fried noodles and other goodies  You can even by an all you can drink cup ( 32oz ) for $9 and enjoy unlimited soda refills the entire gamePeoria Sports Complex does spring training right Its what spring training is all about and if you haven't watched a game here then you truly haven't watched spring training baseball  Parking was only $5I even got to shake Dusty Bakers ( Reds Manager ) hand after the game.
1328,0,My family and I went to brunch there on Sunday late morning The place was pretty empty except for the bar that was full Nice enough place Been here for late night but never for Brunch Well the food took almost 40 minutes to come out The bacon was mooing It was disgusting I almost had to tackle the waiter to get his attention Very very expensive for a I don't really care attitude by all who work there.
35,1,I can't believe the 3 out of 5 ratings This place rocks 4 different mealsall boss I promise you I have no affiliation to the place.
4643,0,Now typically you know what to expect from Motel 6which isn't a whole lot This one took the cake though when I walked in the office and was blasted in the face by the cigarette stench  Not to mention the pregnant girl that had marks all over her armsand each arm bandaged  The service wasn't great either  I arrived about an hour and a half prior to 3 pm which is check-in  Okay my room wasn't ready yet no big deal  We left got something to eat and came back just about at 3  Back into the office she proceeded to tell that she had to find a ready roomwait what  Then told me that the room wasn't ready yet  I made the reservations online about a month ago they could've at least had the room ready by 3And walking on a linoleum wood floor isn't really the most comfortable thing after getting out of the shower  And to top it all off (not that this couldn't happen anywhere else) but a car alarm kept going off several times during the night  Not exactly the best nights sleep is guaranteed here eitherCheck please.
4165,0,This place has the absolute worse cookies I have ever eaten and they are small cookies at $3 each  Don't get the raspberry one as it tastes like you are eating a hibiscus flower Yuck  I was sick all day after eating 1 bite The place is extremely pricey especially for lunch A very sad little restaurant that one should avoid.
680,1,"A little hard to find but well worth it Tried a hot mocha berry spritzer cinnamon roll and an apple ""toptart"" (homemade Pop Tart) Great prices and a homey atmosphere with plenty of tables and a neat aesthetic The woman working the counter was really nice and the pastries were super fresh and tasty and re-heated in the toaster perfectly without us having to ask The mocha was really creamy and well made and the berry spritzer was fresh and refreshing I wish this was closer - I would definitely be a regular."
2488,0,"My girlfriend and I went to The Melting Pot this past Saturday night and the experience was HORRIBLE  It was 9:30 when we showed up and when we walked in we were greeted with a rude hostess  She did not greet us but instead asked ""What can I do for you"" with attitude  Well it's a restaurant so I guess I was there to get my haircut  When I responded a table for 2 she asked again with attitude if I had a reservation  The restaurant was not even half full  I said no she then asked ""well are you having a full course meal"" and I responded ""Just dessert""  After waiting a about 3 minutes we were finally satThe horrible experience did not end there  It took TEN minutes before our waitress even came to our table  They  had a full waitstaff that just kept walking by our table staring at us  When our waitress finally did come she was also rude and offered no pleasantries  We order the Original for 2 and our drinks  Everything was then served together  I must say the chocolate fondue was delicious  However our waitress NEVER came back to check on us or refill our drinks or how our drinks and food were (For the record the Cafe Mocha was ice cold)  And with heavy food like that water is a must  When we were done she finally came over after I flagged her down then asked if we wanted refills  I said yes and the check  Once I paid she brought back my card and just left the checkbook on the table  No ""Thank you have a nice evening Thank your for coming in"" nothing  We were very excited about having a fantastic dessert but the rude staff there ruined the entire experience  We will not be going back to the Scottsdale location."
2711,1,Yes this pizza really is as good as it gets The flavors and the dough are epic Service is friendly They serve lunch now so there is no need to wait in the long dinner lines.
2731,1,It's a little pricey but it is definitely worth it I love this restaurant The atmosphere is amazing I always feel like I'm on a nice date even when I go with my mom I like to get the dinners because you get a really nice selection of different dishes Their tandoori is also amazing its not super dry like most places Try anything you like and you won't be disappointed Get it as spicy as you can standThey also have extensive vegetarian options Extensive delicious optionsI recommend this place wholeheartedly.
1624,0,Lol the glowing reviews below mine must be fake  I've banked with WF for over 5 years mostly at the downtown branch   I found them to have predatory policies that take advantage of people with limited income  Any debits you have will always be taken before any deposits and if you live on a shoestring as do many in these difficult times WF will not have your back here  The personnel seem extra polite but will politely rob you and leave you to die  I have stopped my direct deposits with them as they gave themselves license to help themselves to my money with no recourse to complain  I'm opening a credit union account today anything has to be better than these robbers  Run away.
304,0,Just crappy Mexican food the best part was the Mexican flag in my food But this a disgrace to Mexico in every way possible Every single menu item taste the same  The salsa is watery and nasty Don't waste your time.

2184,1,Great place to see a game  Glad I am a season ticket holder and looking forward to next season.
1087,1,I've been coming here for years and it is definitely the best bagel shop in town They have a wide variety of bagels cream cheese and sandwiches that are all delicious I would personally recommend the egg and oreo bagels Staff is friendly and prices are reasonable They also have really good lemonade :)Overall if you're in the area or looking for a nice bagel/sandwich shop check this place out Oh and they offer a lot of coupons and specials on their Facebook page so be sure to check for those too.
944,1,Yes I like this airport It is NOT bad at all I would give it less than 5 stars for a bit longer lines but they seriously go by sooo fast I like how it's huge I don't like small airports Bigger means they know what they're doing They also have good looking guys here Major +++ for eye candy I'll definitely be flying here again Well I kind of have to since my brother and sister-in-law live in Arizona They have plenty of stores and places to eat.
349,1,First time experience with Zia Recordsimpressed with the staffAdam (on phone)answered all my questionsvery polite friendly & located the CD I wanted quickly & held it for meI visited the store to pick-up my CD & the girl at the counter Shona was amazingWe had a great conversation & she was a very unique person an artist & I enjoyed her comaraderie & picked up my CD & left the store as a 'happy camper'.
4466,0,Absolutely terrible  First glance says cool hip trendy etc but these people have little or no knowledge  They are snobs and they don't respond well if you are not satisfied  If you want to spend way too much and get way too little go to Sassy Glasses.
2918,0,Been to many Sonic restaurants before so I knew what I wanted before I was even at the call button    2 chicago dogs / large onion ring / medium limeadeBoy what a disappointment    the hot dog buns were so soggy that on the first bite everything fell out and left me a relish and mustard mess    the rings weren't any better soggy and the onion still tasted raw    well at least there was the limeade    where's the lime tasted like spriteWill definitely not be back to this Sonic   .
2072,0,Sorry  not impressed with the pizza  greasy  could not finish the 1 slice I ordered  Salad was blah  free popcorn had no taste no salt no butter  blah  not returning.
1396,1,This place is great the food is so delicious and you have to try this place  you won't be disappointed.
398,1,I firmly believe they have the best hummus around I know people love Pita Jungle's hummus but that is nothing compared to this creamy goodness I don't think have ever had hummus so creamy and smooth I have eaten here a few times and it has been delicious but honestly I prefer just stopping in on my way home and picking up a container of hummus and homemade arabic pita bread (also super delicious and soft) I highly recommend it.
4087,0,No music playing at 3:00 in the afternoon Will not dine here againThe food not so good and we all felt violated when the bill arrived Very ordinary and expensive I had the brisket burrito sounded great in the description very dry and no flavor After reading reviews might try some beverages and listen to some music(Maybe that's what its all about).
1159,1,Love this place Great staff killer music and delicious sushi Tiffany and Adrian  behind the bar are awesome & NOTHING beats their happy hour.
1235,1,A family owned GEM of a restaurant  Worth the drive to Wickenburg   Based upon some other reviews I got the Taco Salad and was not disappointed  Everyone in our party was well taken care of and all of the recipes were amazing  Portion sizes were beyond fair and nobody went home hungry  Services was perfect they clearly know how to run a restaurant.
1345,1,I took my 2013 Hyundai Sonata for an oil change Very Nice facility professional & knowledgeable staff I was very pleased with overall experience  Will take all my vehicles to CarLife They even offered me a soft drink or water as I waitedDefinitely the place to go for an oil change.
3702,0,"I stopped by to get a feel for the store before commiting to a courtyard set purchase and refinishing of my chairs I had an ad that as published in Welcome Home AZ for a free umbrella from The Patio Store and I inquired about getting one I was taken aback by the mature looking male that tossed the ad back saying I need to spend $1000 While I dont have a problem with this requirement especially because the fine print read ""some restrictions apply"" the rudeness was uncalled for and it was a very demeaning experience I left with no intention of returning Again I have no prolem with the purchase requirement it makes sense the attitude and rude behaviour just did not."
1631,1,One of my local favorites  Avocado rolls are delicious and the selection of micro-brews should satisfy any beer aficionado's taste  Love the atmosphere and the service is generally top notch  (We had one experience where a waitress in the bar/booth section could have used a little more training is customer service and attentiveness)Food selection and quality/taste was superb  If you time it during their lunch specials and/or happy hours you can save some money.
4549,0,One of the worst KFC's in the country  Always getting short changed on the cole slaw   6 piece bucket had a back bone as one of the pieces  Previous orders were never right   Buy at another location and not this one  We're moving and hope the KFC is better  Eat something else  Will not be going back and will buy our chicken up in the valley.
683,1,I'm a fan of ZizzoI tried them after reading good things here on Yelp and they haven't disappointed  They do a very good job and they do it at a reasonable price  The best part however is the customer service  Everyone there is very personable and Phil is especially great to work withA couple of weeks ago I bought a new suit  Things fit pretty well but obviously I needed the pants hemmed  I called Zizzo in the morning dropped of the suit in the afternoon and they were able to get everything done per my request by closing time  They not only found time to hem the pants they also took in the seat - all in a couple of hoursI trust them with my clothes and encourage you to do the same.
2819,0,I normally like this restaurant However we had the waiter from hell Very pushy  A total Eddie Haskell Stay away from Cody.
749,1,Friends have often told me how great Thai food is but until tonight I've never had the opportunity to taste it myself  Well I'm happy to tell you that after going to 75th Thai Taste with my friend tonight I am a fellow fan of Thai foodAs I pulled up to the restaurant I noticed a small Mexican joint next to it and the Mexican blood flowing through my veins pumped a little faster as I considered the possibility of eating Mexican instead  However I was determined to get a taste of Thai at 75th Thai Taste (plus I had a good friend whom I haven't seen in a while waiting for me inside)As I entered the door I noticed right away how clean the restaurant was  I also noticed that the tables and chairs were not the same mundane fast-food-type furniture  On the contrary the furniture was different and invitingMy second observation was the glass of water my friend had in which a slice of lime was floating  I've never seen that before as most restaurants use slices of lemon but I was excited because I delight in the taste of lime more than I do that of lemonsAs I browsed the menu I noticed many entrees that I wanted to try however I made the decision to order the Stir Fried Asparagus with beef it also came with steamed riceI didn't wait long at all before the food arrived  The portion of food on the plate looked like more than I could handle -- it was a very generous portion  :-)  Green asparagus along with red and green bell peppers freckled the brown beef  It looked delicious so I dug right inThe first bite had me hooked  I surprised myself by eating the whole meal but it was too delicious to save until laterI give 75th Thai Taste 5 stars  It was my first time trying Thai food so I don't have anything to compare it to  But the food was so delicious the restaurant was clean and the service was friendly so if you're around 75th and McDowell try 75th Thai Taste  I'm sure you will not be disappointed.
4606,0,Seems like every time i come here lately a side order of bad attitude that i didn't order is served up  Won't be coming back after the particularly snotty attitude I got from a Ms Elizabeth tonight though What a shame the sweet potato fries were actually decent here.
1245,1,Great service.
4263,0,The guy at the front desk was very condescending on the phone and when I arrived  They only actually changed my oil but marked they put a new filter in and vacuumed/cleaned windows  I thought my coolant was low but they said the fluids were all fine  Well I checked again today  No coolant at all and my engine is running hot  Awesome job guys.
4062,0,"Disclaimer: I really tried to give Chompies a chance For really reals I give it one star for the tasty pickles given before the mealFirst off the menu is way too long and overly complicated Too many choices I watched the other diners also pore over their menus in befuddlement I had to make a snap decision or I could've read that novel all night Seeing the famous original Jewish sliders (featured on Food Network's Man vs Food so they MUST be good right) I made my decision And they come with gravy which should always be a win-win I also ordered the matzo ball appetizer and tried the potato knish Both were mostly flavorless greasy and tasted frozen The matzo app was served with a ranch dipping sauce (WHY) and the potato knish was a small lonely loaf of deep-fried sadness The rest of the meal was even more disappointing The sliders came out very quickly-- much too quickly to be freshly made They came with a side of potato wedges which tasted rather stale and definitely was frozen The sliders were larger than expected but the buns were heavily greased and required multiple napkins throughout the meal The brown gravy served on the side as well as on the sliders was nothing to write home about either -- tasted like any other gravy I guess if you like that powdered gravy mix taste I'm not sure what kind of meat was on the sliders Beef I'm guessing so as its supposed to be a Jewish style/New York delicatessen Upon further inspection the ""beef"" had a strange iridescent sheen a telltale sign of suspect meat Long story short I ate what I could of this sad meal and begrudgingly paid for the $30 + bill for food that I didn't like not even one bit The baked goods/gleaming dessert counter on the way out didn't even call to me as I was already feeling disgusting and ashamed of my carb-and-grease loaded meal Me turning down cannoli Yeah that's pretty bad."
3606,0,Is there a Zero Star  Awesome a BEER garden in downtown Tempe  Sign me up  We get the menu and they have a decent selection of good craft beers  Awesome againThere are 6 of us at the table this night (Saturday prior to this review) and out of the 6 beers we order they are out of 4  Ummm THUD  Oh let me rephrase they were out of 5 cause when they brought one of the beers they said they had they really didn't have it and changed his order to a Kiltlifter without asking  THUD againHow does a beer garden on a Saturday night not have beerOnto the food  I love sausages and they have 4 of them on the menu I think two or three burgers and a few salads  Like 7 items total  So a brat and beer sounded good  Ohwere out of all sausage  THUDEnough for me7 menu items out of 4 beer garden out of at least 5 beers on tap (could have been more who knows) tells me all I need to knowBuh bye.
2618,1,Great place to watch an Iowa game if you are in the Phoenix area and the atmosphere is a huge reason  The uber hot waitstaff is another  U of Iowa fans get drunk and rowdy  Since game times are at 9 people arrive early and get breakfast  Lots of HDTVs all tuned to the Iowa game  There is a huge and loyal Iowa following in the Scottsdale area so seats fill up quick  Drinks are pricy but the hotness of the waitresses tend to distract from the bill  It is HIGHLY recommended to attend the Iowa vs Iowa State football games at the Sandbar  It is INSANITY Looking for more Iowa Natives to review this bar though.
4719,0,I used to love this placebut love is blind I ignored rude and slow servicebut at end of day so many other better options in Old Town Sera Sera.
3282,0,This review is specifically about the bakery  I purchased three different flavors of the mini cheesecakes vanilla bean coffee and cookie for $179 to $199 each for my husbands birthday  These were the worst example of cheesecake we have ever eaten  The flavor is waxy and taste of chemicals and there is no different flavor between any of the three  Will not purchase again expected so much more.
1293,1,My husband and I tried this place a week or two ago and LOVED IT Everyone was nice and it was busier than we thought Didn't take long to get our food AHHH ITS SO GOOD.
3473,0,This hotel tries really hard to be like other W Hotels in the chain but fails miserably My friend and coworker from Italy's iPhone was stolen by the housekeeping staff When we confronted Management about it they completely blew us off and were very dismissive We were all in town for a worldwide conference and my friend realized when we arrived at the venue that he had left his iPhone behind We used find my iPhone and saw it was still in his hotel room We contacted the hotel and they said they would send it over to us A few hours later they called to let me know his phone was not in the room We checked find my iPhone again to see the iPhone had been turned off (it was plugged in while in the room so the battery was not dead) Do not leave anything of value in the room It's very sad a hotel which charges these rates hire criminals and don't take responsibility.
970,1,Been going here for years off and onSandwiches for lunch and pizza kits on the weekendsEverything in the deli is top qualityTheir homemade bread is incredibleThey even have a mini Italian grocery shelf It is where I can consistently get my San Marzano tomatoesLove this place.
95,1,"I wish I would have started this hike early in the morning because the sun throughout the hike is killer  It was my first time taking this on and I started off strong feeling invincible  Not even at the halfway mark I was gasping for air  Pace yourself thank goodness my boyfriend had water and was encouraging  As I kept truckin' I finally see a ""stairway to heaven"" and I will tell you by no means was it an easy climb to the top of this peak  Steep steps to get to the top but once I got there I felt a cool breeze air took in the most beautiful views and enjoyed a few gulps of water  Back down was much easier but by then I had spaghetti legs  A good reminder to continue to climb and hike to get into better shape  Left with sore legs a great tan and an enjoyable way to start my day  I highly recommend."
3041,0,"Received a coupon in the mail for one-half off of an entree after purchasing one and my wife and I decided to give it a go It's in the neighborhood and we enjoy trying out new restaurants especially mom and pops type of placesQuite simply the reviews below should have sounded off the alarms  First the positives The staff is super friendly and courteous smiling and chatting with you in an effort to make you feel like you're in the East Village (or perhaps in Italy)  The bread (served prior to the meal) was hot and crunchy (but crunchy in a good way) On to the negatives The service is extremely slow We had to ask twice for bread after waiting for about 10 minutes after asking the first time The food was extremely subpar I ordered the ""Linguini del Mollusco"" which was very oily (you can literally see the grease dripping off the pasta) and absolutely lacking in flavor  I could taste plenty of oil unfortunately The pasta was swimming in grease The ""Molusco"" element was literally microscopic  I had the smallest shells I have ever seen hardly qualifying this as seafood (unless we are to discuss in molecular terms)My wife had the ""Special"" which was also Linguine but with chicken and artichokes in the same sort of Chardonnay based sauce Once again oily oily oily  She is extremely picky with her food and could barely muster more than a few bites  If one is starving (as I was after a long day at work) one will eat this food (because ultimately it is still food) but at more than $20-30 per entree it's quite a ripoffTo make matters worse the staff decided to add gratuity to our check  We have been to very classy restaurants (eg at Royal Palms) and we have never had gratuity added to our check (rather than us tipping ourselves) for a party of just 2 At the end of the day with drinks and the coupon we still spent well more than $60 for very bland food with ridiculously slow serviceWe will absolutely not be going back   If you want delicious Italian food may I recommend ""Stone and Vine Urban Italian"" on Shea Blvd  Their pasta is flavorful their sauces are delicious and their seafood is NOT microscopic (more seafood than you care to have probably)."
4870,0,"Food was okay nothing to rave about   But the service Oh the service  We chose to eat in the bar table  area the waitress was just shamefully bad   Ignoring tables  getting orders wrong but she came up to the table and proclaimed ""I totally forgot about you guys "" then laughed and said that ""at least I'm honest ""  That was the last straw   We've given you several opportunities to earn our business and you've not taken advantage of a single one."

2182,1,This place kicks ass  I'm a huge fan of non-hippie vegetarian food  I hate the idea that you have to just eat veggies all the time  With the advances we made in soy products it is nice to see someone really going to town with quality ingredientsSo I ordered the buffalo chicken po-boy  SOOO good  Plus it came with fries  Can't hate fries  It's really hard to describe the texture of the sammie but it was exactly what I expected and it was brilliant  I literally can't wait to go back  I think I ask my wife every weekend if we can go  It's so good.
1600,1,Now that I've recovered from my food coma I can happily report on my pleasant experience at Beckett's Table As our large group walked in we were warmly greeted by the staff and seated at an accommodating table in the back I noticed how homey the atmosphere was with the low lightening the open kitchen and the wooden and brick architecture Although the restaurant is situated in a random strip mall in Arcadia you would never know once you get situated inside We started with cocktails and I went for the Palmaire Tasty It had pomegranate infused vodka/juice of some sorts and the soda added a perfect blend to it So now moving on to the food Order everything on the menu or as much as you can handle for the size of your group because everything I tasted was delicious The enchiladas have a zing to them the mac and cheese is cheesy goodness the Brussels sprouts are perfectly cooked with just the right amount of seasoning and the vegetable dish has the right amount and style of veggies to make you want more Now that I was nearly stuffed from the appetizers alone I moved to the entree Although I was full and could have (should have) gone with a lighter option I heard such amazing things about the short ribs that I had to give it a go Yes it was worth every bite and more The shorts ribs were so tender the meat fell into my fork and the potatoes and green beans were the perfect compliment To end the meal marathon the group tasted all the desserts on the menu Yes all of them Each one was good in its own way but my favorite was the chocolate souffle cake What can I say I'm a chocoholic In summary this is a great dining option for dinner with your sweetie or with a huge group You'll leave full from a great meal within a comforting atmosphereLet me also might addthey are only open for dinner and get there early because there will be a wait.
3901,0,This is a cry for help I feel like this place is destined to be a place on restaurant impossible From the start there were issues We waited at the front to be seated for several minutes while there were only a couple tables filled I think there were only 2 servers working which was clearly understaffed but also seemed like its probably normal The food was bad As in my chile relleno tasted ROTTEN It was filled with some gross greasy cheese mess and had doubly greasy batter that it was fried in I honestly wouldn't have fed this to a pigI probably have more to say but I feel that any more effort is unnecessary and would be a lost cause.

2147,1,stacey hoffman is the best i take my animals there when they need a second opinion all of them have been to see her she took a rock out of my bloodhound's stomach and he walked out of her office that day like nothing ever happened to him she has helped me with my cushinoid dog and another with multiple extrahepatic shunts and pancreatic insufficiency she always gives an easy to understand straight forward opinion and is usually avaiable to answer a question or two when needed we are really lucky to have her in phoenix.
800,1,Always get my water here Very friendly people They always offer to rinse out my containers They have great tasting water and sell water containers in multiple sizes The best deal is the water card you get 50 gallons for $10 that's 20 cents a gallon If you eat sweets I also reccomend the Rocky Road.
3457,0,I stopped by here to check it out because I loved Postinos  The wait staff is unfriendly and rude They can't make a good martini to save their life  There are much better places to go in that area that are a ton better   If you are thinking of going here move on.
4951,0,I really had high hopes for this place My cousin and I both ordered an iced chai There was so much milk in it you could barely taste a hint of the chai We both thought it tasted like cereal milk Two sips and we tossed both our drinks What a waist of almost $9 I might go back and try a regular coffee but until then 1 star remains.

4013,0,"They just phone it in  On top of that they bother the heck out of you to spend more money there and then they take so long to finish that you're in too big of a hurry to notice just what a lousy job they have actually doneThis review is especially for their Scottsdale location at Shea/Scottsdale Road but it really applies to all of their locations as I have used many of them over the yearsI lived in the Phoenix Area for more than 40 years before my current job took me to Southern California  During that time I drove vintage cars and always wanted them to be looking nice  In the mid-nineties the car wash that I had frequented 2-3 times per week for years changed hands and the quality just fell apart  I had noticed Danny's all over town and decided to give them a tryThey were spectacular in those early years  I got great service everyone was friendly and you didn't have those annoying ""how about a detail oil change upgrade to first class"" upselling as you drove up  You chose you paid you hung out in a nice place while they really cleaned your car up niceThen somebody got greedy  At first there was this attack of the upsell elves coming up to your car and asking you if you wanted to buy more stuff sometimes two-to-three times  I fended them off at first but they became so persistent that I complained and well I got a bewildered ""it's our right to make money"" attitude from them so I basically started looking elsewhere and just used them when I was desperateCut to the present  I came back this last weekend to visit family and my volvo wagon was a mess  Kid dogs and busy wives lead to a critical mass where the car just needs to get washed once a month  I had some time so I took it to Danny's which was close by  Bought the ""Royal"" wash which set me back nearly 30 bux  I was sure my car would be clean enough to build a satellite in when I got it out the other sideWell after being chased around the exterior waiting area by bees for 45 minutes I finally saw the attendant waving his rag at me that my car was done  Or at least to their standardsBut not mine oh heaven's no  There was still bird poo on the roof  When I pointed this out the guy sheepishly griinned and made a half-hearted attempt to rub a few of them off with a rag  When I scratched at a couple with my nail and they just came away he just shrugged his shouldersWe were in  a hurry at this point so we just got in and sped off  But wait there's more  While we were driving back to the house we noticed that they hadn't vaccuumed around the inside of the car in any ""not so hard to reach"" areas like the center console or under the front of the seats  I can sometimes forgive not getting in the nooks and crannies but there was still TRASH in some of the places  Looking around more I noticed that the car's interior handn't really been ""protected"" with the goo they use -- the tops of the doors the dash top and that's about it  The center armrest was filthy and definitely not clean and the back seats were still dry as a bone  I noticed that the workers there obsess over new cars and cars with lots of chrome  As I was dodging the killer bees I watched in amazement as the chrome bumper of a very large Ford pickup was polished like the mirror of the Hubble TelescopeBut they are totally phoning in the work on the family car  My 8-year-old Volvo is far from a beater but it doesn't compare to some of the exotic French and Italian stuff I used to have  I still feel it should get the same attention especially at $30."

3399,0,I am a fan of the 500 club and often visit this course as a break in scenery from my home MVCC course  Today however was by far the most unpleasant experience I have had at the 500 club  I do not often play late twilight hours but today I was invited by three colleagues to play your course so I obliged  We arrived and checked in at 6 pm  We purchased our round ($28) and proceeded to play or try to play nine holes  For the most part the round was enjoyable despite not having any beverage or drink service in triple-digit temperatures but that was not a concern for us  What concerned me and why I am writing today is because of the rude manner in which we were treated trying to rush our round with approximately 15 hours of sunlight remaining  They wanted to close up shop early and did not inform us of that fact  After a certain time only teenagers run the golf course and do not understand long-term market share or basic customer service principles which pay their hourly wageNevertheless we were rudely escorted off to the club house and not even allowed to drop our bags off at the bag drop area  I've heard of some pretty bad golf experiences with post-round play but this one takes the cake  Absolutely unacceptable to be mistreated in this manner  We would not have mind if we were politely asked to finished or if we would rush our play to finish by 7:30 pm but instead we were forced and guided back to the club house like a bunch of kids (all four of us are successful executives working with fortune 500 companies in Arizona)  More so this would have been acceptable had we known to return the carts by 7:30 pm  Why would the pro shop employees sell us a round at 6 pm without informing us that the carts had to be returned at 7:30 pm  To communicate the time expectation with two holes remaining in the round is absurd  That important factorial is beyond me but not the root cause of our complaint with this customer service -- it was the manner in which we were treated after receiving this new information and forced off of the course Sadly I have been playing here for quite some time but after my experience this afternoon I will find it hard to return when there are much better courses in Arizona who will not only provide exceptional greens but an exceptional experience in-and-out of the pro shop.
3316,0,"How this place has great reviews is completely beyond me  I have never been in a dirtier less visually appealing salon with the most unfriendly employees ever  I went here specifically because of  the reviews  Maybe I got spoiled living in CA (where every salon I went to for 11 years was clean nicely decorated and had great employees) but in my opinion this place a dumpUpon entering the salon for the first time I had a hard time finding the front desk  It's hidden around the corner  The first thing you see when you walk in is a crappy shelving unit holding dirty goggles and towels  And don't even get me started about the paint job or rest of the decor in this place  I felt like I needed a shower upon entering this place  When I finally made my way around to the front desk (if you can call it that) I didn't even get a ""hi"" ""hello""not even an ""f you you're interrupting me while I'm staring at my nails""  *I* the customer greeted the employee with a smile and a ""Hello""  I told her it was my first time at this salon and that I'd like to purhcase five tans in a level 2 bed  I didn't even ask her any annoying questions because I'm capable of reading the board on the wall myself yet she treated me like I just asked her for a kidney  She threw a clipboard in my direction and said ""Fill this out""  I filled out the portion with my name and address and began checking yes or no to the additional questions on the waiver (that silly legal form that protects them from being sued)  She yelled at me that I didn't need to answer the questions and that I should just sign the bottom  Ok sure  I can not answer any of the important questions that you might need to know about a new clientlike whether or not I burn easily etc  I mentioned to her that I had not been tanning in over a year so I didn't want to go to the full time  Typically when you go to a new salon they will recommend a time based on what they know about their beds  She took my money and in the most annoyed voice ever said ""How long""  Ummmmm I just told you I hadn't been tanning in a while so again I haven't been tanning in a while  How long do you recommend  Her response ""Seven""  A question  Why are you asking me  I know nothing about your level two beds and since you didn't have me answer any of those silly questions on your waiver I doubt you could make a proper recommendation anyway  So sure I guess seven is good  Another customer happened to walk in behind me during this exchange and the girl behind the counter said ""follow me"" and didn't say a word to the other customer  A ""I'll be with you in just a moment"" would have been completely appropriate and normal in this situationSo I follow her down a narrow bright red hallway (that it looks like my nine year old painted) to a room with a flimsy folding door  She then tells me to bring my dirty googles and towel back to the front and drop them in the baskets  Waitwhat  Do you want me to wipe down the bed and do a load of laundry for you too  Why am I paying you for me to do your job for you  I have NEVER been asked to clean up after myself at a tanning salonEVER  This made me wonder if they even go in there and clean the bed after I'm done  So I fold my door behind her and latch it with the flimsy lock they've placed because a regular door lock won't work  I put on my lotion in the tiny room (banging my elbows on the walls and bed in the four inch square space I have) and step into the stand up bed  The lights eventually flicker on and I notive SEVERAL long hairs caught in the wiring surrounding the bed  Now I realize this is perfectly normal but if they cleaned the bed every once in a while they might pick out the long hairs that have been there for over two weeks now (as I've noticed in my subsequent visits)The other two times I've been I've dealt with another girl who seems a little more friendly but I have to say I'll be finishing up my five tan package and never return to this little hole again  This place leaves so much to be desired  For the amount they charge they need to clean up a little repaint and consider having the employees do the cleaning instead of the customers  First impressions are everything people."
17,1,"Ever been somewhere and had service that just made your morning  A Chinese couple sat down at the booth next to me  The server came up with their food delivered it and then softly asked ""um how do you say 'thank you' in your language"" They told him (it's 'xie xie' though my spelling is probably off) and he smiled bowed and said ""xie xie""His manners his approach and his openness were like a warm hug He could have been brisk and to the point he could have just said ""thank you"" He could even have been surly He chose to take 20 seconds and reach out to a total stranger I'm not saying this makes CB the best place ever But it sure gave me a smile at the start of a long day and I am very grateful In my ancestral language ""tusen tak""."

1048,0,We stayed at the Hyatt Place in Scottsdale in January 2009  For all of us it was our first time staying at a Hyatt Place (I'd actually never heard of the chain)  The amenities were nice the rooms were spacious and the free WiFi was great   The lack of room service was a bit of an annoyance but apparently serves as an indication of how the hotel views hospitality at large  Never in all my hotel stays (which range over 100 times a year) have I been so poorly treated by hotel staff  I cannot would not and will not ever recommend staying at this hotel - no matter how much you save over local competitors or how pretty the lobby decorations are.
3943,0,"The other day my boyfriend and I stopped in to get something quick to eat before we saw a movie He tells me what he wants to eat runs to the restroom while I wait in line to orderI get up to the counter to order and the cashier looked like she just crawled out of bed You could tell she didn't want to be there especially on a Sunday morning probably nursing a pretty gnarly hangover She looked tore up like something the cat dragged in But regardless I thought I would give her the benefit of the doubt and asked her ""Hello How are you today"" She doesn't say anything except "" What do you want"" That immediately pissed me off but I was in a good mood so I decided to keep my mouth shut and order our food I order the french toast and she says we are all out of french toast I told her I would wait then because that's what my bf wanted and he was still in the bathroom So I wait about another three minutes and my bf comes out looking confused as to why I am still standing there I let him know they did not have what he wanted This time we order together and the cashier tells us that they are out of potatoes and we would not be able to substitute them for anything else I was so frustrated and pissed at the crappy service we decided to not eat there and walked out  How does a bakery/ breakfast place not have the key  items on the menu on a Sunday morning Not the mention the service from the cashier was horrid You will get better service at a frickn fast food place I don't recommend this place to anyone."
3208,0,The food is very mediocre  The step down out the front door needs to be addressed  My wife was carrying my 2 year old daughter  and they both fell and landed pretty badly  The floor drops down about 6 inches right outside the door  Needless to say my daughter hit her head on the concrete and sustained quite a bump  The manager got us some ice and a towel but I would have liked a little more assistance and verification that we were going to be okIt's troubling that our society is so sue happy that it's the first thing the restaurant thinks of and tries to distance themselves from the situation and fails to respond in a decent mannerFix your front door  You have it painted so you realize it's an issue  A few bags of concrete and some labor and your entry can actually be safeIf you are in the area Greasewood Flats is a much better choice.
4615,0,"Tanya W I wished so bad that I had read your review before I myself became involved with these clowns  They completely ruined what's supposed to be one of the most fondest memories of your life     My experience with them: I found a dress that I liked not loved When I found it I was all alone so I had the opinions of the BC staff coercing me into thinking this is the best dress and the best deal I will ever find I felt very torn about the dress but time is running out before my wedding date and I felt I needed to come to a decision sooner than later So I wrote them a check for 1600 (a steal according to them) and left no sooner than I had started my car to go home I was having second thoughts and by the time my 15 minute car ride was over and I was opening my front door that I thought ""Oh my god I don't want that dress"" So I called and told them of my second thoughts and told them I was coming back 15 minutes later I was back in their store arguing with John the President of the store He told me that I was just having bridal nervousness and that this was normal He also said that I probably left his store to go to another store and found another dress there and that he didn't believe me He also said he had already gone to the bank in the last 15 minutes so there is nothing he could do After this drawn out argument I told him that after he was so unwilling to help his customer having been called a liar and that I ""liked the dress you're just nervous"" I told him that he was making me incredibly uncomfortable and that I didn't want to do business with people who operated like this I told him I was going to cancel my check and that there was nothing I could do about that *zing Long story short Jerry called me that night and told me that i was under contract with them and that I had to get a dress with them whether it was that one or another one I said when I come back I don't ever want to see John again and that she really needs to re-evaluate the way they treat their customers Needless to say when I went to pick up my dress yesterdayeverything was in boxes and disarray  I found out they are ""moving"" (read as going out of business i bet considering they have no place to move to yet) That's what happens when you run a petty money pinching unprofessional business that they did and I don't feel bad at all I got my dress and I am washing my hands of these fools forever."

1267,1,I hate to do this because I don't want this place to be busy for selfish reasons however I have an obligation to uphold It is of no surprise that Vovomeena is anything but fantastic coming from the flavor dense minds from Tuck Shop and Astor HouseThis morning I got their signature Japanese iced coffee and the Espanola which was kind of an egg potato spinach and cheese pie with a chunky red sauce that is bursting with flavorsThe decor is sustainable and hip chairs were comfortable lighting is good staff is friendly and personable as well Can you tell I like the place.
4417,0,"I really love the food here I have never had anything from the menu that I did not enjoy However I will never return to this establishment after the way I was treated this eveningAfter finishing our meals I gave my credit card to our server to pay our bill Upon returning to our table and leaving the receipt for my signature the server as an afterthought told me that she had accidentally charged another bill to my credit card I was then told that the charge was for about $5000 and that it would be credited back to my account in 2-3 business days Needless to say I was not happy and asked to speak with the manager Prior to getting to my conversation with the manager let me explain my thinking Based on what the server told me I was charged $5000 by mistake and then was charged $6773 for my bill The server understood that the $5000 (even with a credit authorization run) was going to show as pending on my account and would take up available funds or credit on my account Rather than come tell me of the mistake that was made the server put through the credit authorization and then charged my bill to the account The server had no way of knowing if the funds would be available for both charges but knew that for at least 2-3 business days both charges would take up funds or credit from my account This means that in the event that this extra $5000 put me over my credit limit or overdrew my account I would be left holding the bag with the server never having thought to ask me if I could afford to be without the extra $5000 for 2-3 days Essentially my thinking is that the server's actions were a horrible way to handle the situation I spoke with the manager and he was completely uncaring about the situation He basically told me that it was only $5000 and that I would get it back in 2-3 business days He then proceeded to ask me if I had the $5000 available and that if I did it was no big deal I explained that even if I had the $5000 I was now $5000 poorer due to his company's action He did not careI then returned to my table and used my phone to check the charges on my account It was not a $5000 but a $7647 charge Both the server and manager lied about the amount that was incorrectly charged to my account This upset me I found the manager and explained the discrepancy in what I was told and the facts Again the manager was not concerned Basically the server and manager had lowered the incorrectly charged sum by more that 1/3 Then the purported owner of the establishment told me ""this happens all the time and no one has ever been upset about it"" You read that correctly IT HAPPENS ALL THE TIME This restaurant should not be trusted with your plastic I am just thankful that it wasn't a $50000 bill that was charged to my card I will never again visit this place of business due to the way in which this situation was handled."
3067,1,"A year before we married my husband and I had the distinct pleasure of visiting with Mary Lou a few months before her death in 2010  We toured her lovely castle and had distinct images of her life as a child on the stone floors looking at the stone walls covered with eclectic mis-matched pieces of her life  I admired her for the child like wonder that was still in her eyes  Unfortunately 3 years later when we took my son to the castle he couldn't meet this wondrous soul for himself  I highly recommend making this a ""must see"" stop if you are ever in the area  It is an artist's play land and being a poet I could find the beautiful imagery in every nook and cranny  I look forward to going back again some day soon."

1984,1,I have a serious crush on every Williams Sonoma but this one in particular is close to my heart The staff is always very friendly and welcoming to me anytime I shop there I've had fun buying items off our registry with gift cards and when the toaster we received didn't work they happily exchanged it for a new one Like other Williams Sonomas their quality of products is great but they also incorporate a local feel into their shop as well They host artisan and technique classes on the weekends and when they do they bring in local products to use during their classes and the local chefs to do the demos It's a great local touch.
1127,1,Great Happy Hour Menu and wonderful staff and service  The Happy Hour Menu now takes place from 4pm to 6pm  Go with a couple of friends so you can share all the good food and drinks  The La Hacienda and Prickley pear margaritas are really good  If you are willing to try something new other than your normal Tequila ask for Danielle the Tequila Goddess she is a wealth of knowledge and she will definitely guide you in the right direction  Try the Don Julio 1942 tequila its a sipper not straight shot so enjoy yourself.

1865,1,This was my first time to go to Claim Jumper and after hearing all the hype from my friends and girlfriend I decided to finally go They seated is promptly it was 10 at night so not busy For the appetizer we got spinach artichoke dip which was amazing The chips were warm and it tasted awesome For main course our server recommended the tenderloin tips So we ordered that and the baby back beef ribs The tenderloin was cooked perfectly and it was on a bed of mashed potatoes That was awesome The vegies that came with it were covers in butter so I liked them The ribs had a great sauce with them and tasted good but would try their chicken instead next time All in all great food service and atmosphere Will be back soon an want to try a desert next time.

4893,0,"Well what can I say  Wow  This was the WORST restaurant experience that I have had in my 43 years on this earth  I am not exaggerating  It was very very painfulIt started with the hostess  A ""500"" minute wait was all she said  25 minutes later we discovered that she had mistakenly crossed out our names  OK no problem mistakes happen we understand  She says we get the next 2 person table  Cool  As we are waiting I notice a couple being seated that came in much after us  After some questioning she allegedly crossed out their names too  Umm really  The girl had no clueFinally got seated and the waitress tells us the kitchen is backed up and to be patient  OK we are patient  We order our food a spicy chicken sandich and a tuna sandwich  As we are waiting and waiting and waiting we hear the waitress scolding customers""I told you if you didn't order right away it would take longer you chose to wait  Really   At another table she says the same thing  The table next to us once they get their food complain and leave without even touching it  Oh myApparently the kitchen is small and can't handle a crowd  The 2 sandwiches mentioned above took 70 minutes to get to usYES 70 MINUTES  I can't believe we waited that long  We were so mad but at some point we were too investedOnce the food comesno chips  They will be along in a bit but they were not ready yet  ReallyThe food was decent no complaints there  Every single table though was mad and upset about the wait  It was the worst experience I have ever had at a restaurant and I eat out A LOTAnyway stay away from this place  They don't deserve your business  This by the way is also the first ""bad"" review I have ever written They should be ashamed."

3633,0,Gave Ra two chances  Still do not like the atmosphere nor the food  What's with the loud music  Perhaps it's management hoping that I won't notice how awful the food is by painfully triggering my eardrums  The noodle soup the title of which goes something like $14 bowl of soup (I don't know it was so noisy I couldn't think) was TERRIBLE  I really can't expound on why I found it disgusting  All I remember as I tasted the broth and noodles was a flashback of Warner Bros cartoons where a character (was it Bugs Bunny) was shoveling paper money into a burning fireplace  Total waste of money  Mom didn't like the soup as well  A coworker of mine and I met here for happy hour and tried many apps which I do admit were nicely priced  The low prices aren't enough to get me to return however  The one plate I remember liking so much so that I ordered it twice (we were very hungry) was made of tofu  I even wrote it down and asked for it at my favorite sushi resto but they didn't know what it could be much less replicate it  Since I'm not much of a drinker I cannot discuss happy hour drink specials as I only drink water- I rarely order alcohol because I prefer to eat my caloriesSayona-Ra.

3033,1,My experience was fabulous I went in with 7 other girls for a bachelorette party not knowing how large and accommodating this place would be When we got there they had a banquet room open and ready and ice bucket for our wine (you can bring your own wine awesome right) and a bottle opener for the wine (thank goodness because we had forgotten one) We had each were going to purchase a travel zoo voucher for an hour massage and 35 minute facial but they said we could just pay as we came in rather than hoping there were enough vouchers available That was super convenient for everyone Even with some of us extending our services we were out of there in 4 hours I wasn't aware that they had such a large staff It was a wonderful experience My massage was fabulous and the therapist took the time to let me know some stretches I can do that will prevent my back from getting tight The facial was amazing too The only thing I can complain about is that when we went to check out the gratuity was automatically 20% of the original cost of the services (not the travelzoo rate) so everyone's bill ended up being twice as much as they were expecting to pay I just wish they would have been upfront with us when scheduling the appointment or when we arrived so that we didn't end such a relaxing session with the shock of an unexpected cost That part was probably on the voucher but because we hadn't purchased one I wasn't aware Either way it was a fabulous deal and my bridesmaid were so impressed with the whole day and intend on setting up follow up appointments with the massage therapist for themselves and their husbands.

4680,0,I just can't even believe you took a perfectly respectable concept like gourmet nachos and threw it all away  What did a nacho ever do to you  Will I come back here  Bring back the melted cheese goodness and then maybe  Who wants a late night bowl o soup  Tsk tsk.
4609,0,I usually go elsewhere when I do laundry but as of late it seems any laundromat I go to seems to be on the fritz of despair I recently went to this location they had 27 I repeat 27 machines that did not work it was a mess and the coin machine I repeat the coin machine was out of servicehow the fuck am I suppose to do laundry without quarters Luckily I brought some with me and also had some on reserve in my car ashtray but I am short just a few bucks for drying So the girl behind the counter notifies me that she has change which I promptly hand her a 20 and say can I get like two dollars worth of change she says she can not change out a 20 dollar bill I have had the worse luck at laundromats lately I swear between the dimwitted help and broken machines the only reason this place did not get a flaming bag of dog poo thrown against it's window is because it has a few classic arcade games insidethat probably are out of order too.
1942,0,Freaking out a little Just got finished eating there Hairs in the food and I saw a cockroach crawl across the kitchen floor At least if I get sick tonight I will know why.
3066,1,"If you're thinking to yourself ""aw man it's just mexican food there are a thousand mexican restaurants in Phoenix"" stop whatever you're doing come to Tacos Atoyac and try some awesome authentic mexican food  This place is unassuming in a ""blink-and-you'll-miss-it"" kind of way but do not judge this book by its cover  Try it love it."

4387,0,I love there food So good and delicious Also clean and organize And you don't have to wait long time tell you get the food so happy So happy that I visit  this place .
2170,1,Staff was extreamly knowledgable on guns Love the museum aspect of the store Hard to not feel like an american when you walk through this place.
2113,0,RUN AWAY I would of given back the 25 dollar gift card if I could of avoided the food poisoning.
772,0,I've been here 3 times and each time the staff was rude and the wait very long Trying to give them a fair chance but today was last straw got eyebrows waxed and I have skin ripped off my eyelidsit is horrid Tell me they didn't know this I get red all the time so didn't notice at first but I'll never go back.
614,1,First experience with thai food and it was an amazing one At first sight of the restaurant (outside) I had not been impressed once inside that changed We were greeted and seated immediately  We were not rushed to order and the waitress had a great deal of patience with me as I questioned her about everything The food was delicious but must say the thai iced tea was my favorite thing that night Extremely fair prices and large portions.
1884,0,"This review is solely for the employee whose name tag read ""syd the kid"" On Friday she wore a purple headband She is by far the worst restaurant employee that I ever came across My supervisor (my supervisor is well known aka a public figure I won't mention who she is) and I came in for a mid-morning break We both ordered smoothies and we both had horrible experiencesSyd the kid coughed into my cup while she was writing my name on the cup I demanded a new cup and she was like ""why do you want another cup"" and I said cause you coughed into it She rolled her eyes and got another cupAt this time a few customers recognized my supervisor and was asking to take photos with her which held up the line Finally supervisor ordered her drink As the others who were starstrucked to see my supervisor went away someone behind the counter asked Syd the kid if she knew who that woman was Syd the kid said ""who knows Probably a stripper"" wrong Syd  Why don't you read the news a bit more often before making a complete fool of yourself Even sadder that she knew her name (for the cup) and she has a very unique name that even if you couldn't recognize her by face at least do so by name Supervisor heard and had this look of disgust on her face Great impression of old town she must have hadWe both had the piña-kale-Ada which was okay Didn't taste organic."
1869,1,Tried several dishes for the first time loved them all I spent a lot of time in the far east and this is as good Today went for the dim sum kathie and I ate alot and the bill was less than $20 I would have paid double.
3395,0,Ok I'm so sorry to have to give such an update review  I've been to Sala Thai several times since discovering it a couple of years ago  I decided to take my really good friends for lunch a couple of weeks ago When we walked it we sat on the newly expanded side  They had recently doubled in dining space The food of just okay this time  I'm not sure if the cook of having an off day or what  Well while we were eating and chit-chatting away my friend started to get all excited from across the booth telling me to get up and look behind me  When I did I saw a roach crawling on my seat then scurry away to the next booth  Okay I tried not to freak out myself and continued our lunch Then my 7 year old starts to freak out next to me as he notices 2 roaches on the wall next to my friend across the table  Okay that was it  My son and friend got up and stood there until our bill came  Our waitress came out and saw what the excitement was all about but do you think she said anythingof course not  I assume this must be a normal thing for them now  Well needless to say I don't think I'll be returning to Sala Thai.
327,1,This is a great place for who ever likes original east coast subs The meats are sliced wright in front of you  Very fresh Friendly staff.
684,1,I have to force myself to limit how often I come to Chico's because it's so good First off they offer chips and a trip to the salsa bar right after you pay for your order This way you get a quick appetizer and something to keep you entertained while they cook your order But there's only one thing I order each time I come here Nachos This place has the most delicious plate of nachos that I've come across in the area Of course the serving size is generous I usually make it a point to not finish the plate it's so big It has the standard toppings the beans are good the red sauce that they drape over it is great But what makes these better then most is first the cheese love the flavor and their not afraid to pile it on But what wins me over every time is that they cook the plate in a broiler which makes it all nice and hot melts crisps up the cheese and the chips The combination of it all is a heavenly splurge that doesn't hit a spot but burns a new special place of its own into your gastronomic mind So beware Staff here has always been nice I've never had an order go wrong never had an issue on quality or consistency.
979,1,What can I say we were lucky enough to get invited for pre-opening to this week at Tommy Urban Kitchen right in the heart of Old Town Scottsdale The place was inviting very nicely decorated The staff warm and knowledgeable and Zoran who immediately greeted up with open arms always making you feel welcome We started with the Burrata which was Amazing Then into the Lobster Bisque with just a hit of saffron Perfection Then followed by the Best Clams and Lin quine perfect amount of garlic with gorgeous mini la clams best I have had in the Valley Which bring me to my husband Fettuccine Bolognase so flavorful and the meat giving the dish great substance and texture This Saturday Big Opening I recommend everyone try this incredible restaurant Which by the way will be offering Happy Hour pricing Monday-Friday from 11am-6:30pm with dishes from both appetizers to entrees and wines are fabulous Believe when I say once you try Tommy Urban Kitchen you will make this place your favorite local hangout Kudos to the Management and Chef they hit this right on the markLiz DTim D.
1466,1,Amazing  The classes are awesome the instructors great and it's worth every penny.
448,0,Probably my worst dining experience EVER  Went on Saturday evening had a lovely time drinking overpriced cocktails outside while enjoying the gorgeous setting  That is where any mention of a pleasurable experience ends  Once seated the service was dismal at best  Server took 15 mins to bring one glass of champagne even though we saw it sitting in the bar ready to be picked up for over 12 mins (the other members of my party were never even offered a refreshed cocktail the entirety of our stay)  Took another 15 mins for us to track down a different waiter so he could go find OUR waiter so we could order  Appetizers came fairly quickly and were just ok very disproportionate servings and not at all worth the prices  After our apps came another 30 mins passed before we finally flagged down the manager to find out 1) where our waiter was and 2) where the rest of our meal was  10 mins later the manager came back to tell us that the delay was due to our chicken  2 people in my party ordered the chicken - didn't realize they had to kill the chicken and prep it before cooking because I have never had to wait over 45 mins for chicken (15 mins while we ate our apps and another 30 mins eating our 2nd basket of bread)  Our waiter finally showed up acting completely aloof wondering why we were upset and then quickly disappeared again  Another 20 mins and still NO FOOD  We had had enough  We flagged down the manager to advise we'd be leaving  He tried to get us to stay and offered to pay for our meals  At that point he could have offered us meals for the next month for free and we would not have bitten  This was beyond horrible and honestly the one star I gave it was very generous  There is nothing anyone could do to ever make me return to this establishment with the staff they have working there  For what was supposed to be high end resort dining this was anything but  I've gotten much better service at Chili's Bar and Grill and that is just pathetic  The management and owners of Prado should be ashamed.
4963,0,First if your a Dodgers fan you will love this park  I'm a STL fan and love the game of baseball in general especially spring trainingWe went to the Friday night game and watched the Dodgers and the Giants  It was a good game and I enjoyed hanging out with the family in the lawn seats  There was over 11000 fans at the gameThe game start time was 705PM and I don't recommend going to a night game here  Getting to the ballpark is a hassle during this time because you are going to get caught up with rush hour traffic The concession stands had long lines at least until the 4th inning  The prices were typical of a major event  Food was decent  I enjoyed chicken tenders and fries for $675  At the end of the game they had a post game fireworks show  It was awesome and I think it takes place on Friday's if there is a night gameOverall I won't be attending this ball park again for spring training  It doesn't give you the spring training feel  Its too big However It does offer an up close experience to the batting cages practice fields and the Dodger players around the lakeIn closing the tickets to the games are too expensive for a spring training game and it doesn't even offer a spring training experience.
502,0,Overdue reviewUpset They would have received a higher rate but they've greatly dissapointed me We went in for Mother's day and was rudely told  to leave because they only allow those who have made reservations ahead of time My family has been going to their restaurant for quite awhile but to be treated that way was unacceptable They should have put a sign up or even just explain it nicely to us would have workedBottom line Will not be going backPOOR customer service.
2057,1,Phenomenal meal as always We have a number of good Vietnamese restaurants in Philadelphia but we don't have a Little Saigon Make sure you don't miss this gem.
3196,0,Nothing wurst than a bad weenie No bun intendend But every so often I get a hankering for a hot dog A Chicago hot dog at that In the windy city at Milwaukee and Devon sits SuperDawg and it is a site to behold But I ain't in the Windy City I'm in the Hot Blistering Sweltering City And I didn't know where to go And then I drove down Thomas and saw the Vienna Beef sign That was it That's what I needed The universe had answered my calling You ever enter a restaurant and immediately have the instinct that you should turn your ass around and leave quickly Yea Well I didn't listent to my gut Cuz it was rumbling with hunger and I could smell the hot dogs steaming The place wasn't clean Ok it was dirty Stained floors rec room style paneling with splintering chunks of wood and vinyl chairs with duct tape Hmmmstill not enough for me So I get home with my Chicago style dog with pepperoncini neon relish celery salt tomatoes in a soft poppy seed bun with krinkle fries Ate it in 90 seconds Spent the next 40 minutes in my bathroom You get the picture Thank God for that Reader's Digest I found under the sink cuz I would have been real bored.
283,1,If you are a cigar smoker then Goodfellas Cigars is the place to be They have a great spacious lounge with modern furnishings The owner is a great guy that really knows his cigars customer service and how to run an outstanding business The prices are very reasonable and they have a great selection of cigars humidors and  products They even have hard to get cigars and they are the first in the area to carry some rare or new cigars They have events quite often that are always a great time There is a poker room in the back humidor cabinets you can rent as a member and plenty of tv's and chairs to hang out in and catch a game  Walk in for the first time and I promise you you will always be coming back to pass the hours before you even realize it.

1922,1,Phoenix is a one of a kind city that is beautiful fashionable BIG and luxurious :-).
1117,1,My husband and I had to attend a family reunion in the Phoenix area and we wanted to make a mini-vacation out of it and decided to stay at the Wigwam  We had a wonderful spacious quiet clean room/suite overlooking the golf courses and the patio was particularly relaxing to sit out on in the evenings  Our room also had a small fridge that came in very handy and there was a fireplace that looked very cozy (we may just have to come back in the winter to try it out)  It was great that we could have our dog stay in the room with us and my husband enjoyed golfing both mornings we were there - Gold Course & Blue Course All of the staff we encountered were very friendly and check-in and check-out were both very smooth and fast  We had breakfast one morning at Red's which was very good and very inexpensive for the buffet especially and it looked like it has a pretty nice bar in there too  We are really looking forward to planning another getaway to the Wigwam.
2428,0,So after the assplosion I think I'd better write my reviewSucked as soon as we walked in  Party of 5  Approximately 1pm  Not busy  2 four-top and one 2-top tables empty plus the sushi bar  They said it would be a 20-minute wait for us to get a bigger table  We suggested just taking a 4-top  Ended up that the co-owner of my company pushed two tables together and Voila  We were seated  Drink order got taken quickly  Our waitress Sarah hated us from moment one  Got our drinks placed our orders  I've never waited so long for sushiI had the tempura box lunch special and everyone got a bunch of sushi dishes to taste  One girl is allergic to gluten so ordered hers wrapped in soy paper  It came wrapped in rice  The waitress also claimed that they don't wrap their sushi in cucumber  Huh  I've never been anywhere that DOESN'T wrap in cucumber instead of rice  Luckily we took the plate to the sushi chef and he re-did it with the soy paper  It was a WAY smaller serving than the originalShe was great about refilling our drinks but just wasn't as friendly (meaning not at ALL) as any other server I've ever hadThis place sucks ball and I won't be backNow Back to the assplosion.
3527,0,"Let's be honest here-- We don't get our nails done for the actual polish its the pampering that mattersThat being said I got a french tip spa pedicure My nails came out decent enough though i haven't had them more than a couple a days so i'm not sure about chipping just yetIt was a weekend afternoon around lunch so of course we had to wait a few minutes no problem The color selection isn't that great and the bottles seem a little on the old side but this place isnt exactly expensive I mentioned i wanted french tips and she still insisted i pick out a color Strange but i select the whitest white i could find on the wall We get seated about 15 minutes later put our feet into the water great temperature but our ""massage"" chairs do not turn on/vibrate/move at all well that's weird but i guess not the end of the world She sits down in front of me to turn on the jets and spends about 3-5 minutes turning it on to no avail She simply gave up and instructed me to soak my feet There were at least 4 other chairs open and when i asked if it didn't work she just said ""no"" and proceded to prep the area I thought she would maybe try to make up for the lack of massage chair and whirlpool jets with a decent leg massage but NO Basically applied lotion and didnt even scrub my heels with any pressure I will need to go home and do it myself after the shower THIS PLACE WAS TERRIBLETotal came out to $29 (regular price) without tip and with NO apology for the broken amenities DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY."

381,1,If you love burger this place is a must visit  Love all the choices  All the staff are friendly also.
1078,1,"I have been here several times now so it's time I write a review I LOVE this place  Seriously  Ok I know soda is bad for me weather is full on cane sugar or diet stuff it's all bad  We all have are vices right  At least I limit myself to one per day  I try to keep the addiction in check  And I love variety  I could easily get stuck in a rut with Pepsi Coke and Dr Pepper but at Pop The Soda Shop that is impossibleThere are rows and rows of soda  If you can imagine it they probably have it  It's amazing  They even carry some types of water and energy drinks  My favorite is the Root Beer isle  They must have 50 types of root beer  I love trying different types of root beer and this is the place to go if you love the beer of root  They have Dr Pepper in little bottles  YUM  And Stewart's Key Lime soda which is the BOMB  If you have not tried it you must  I also happen to be a fan of Cheer Wine and they've got plenty of that too  Of course they have the ""real"" coke in glass bottles too  An ice cold coke in a bottle is the best  If you just can't wait to try something they have just about everything cold in the cases in the back  And if ya go on a hot day that is a mustThe staff are knowledgeable and very helpful  I have bought cases and they have happily put them in my care for me  I would rather give my hard earned dollars to a locally owend and operated store than a big box store when I have a choice  So go and stock up on your soda here  It's worth the trip wherever you are."
4530,0,I really want to like this Native New Yorker as it is close to my house  I have been to various locations around the Valley and generally enjoy the food and atmosphere  This location though is woefully inconsistent in both food quality and serviceSince this location has been open I have been disappointed that one week food quality is great but then the next time food is either under or over cooked  Specifically the Chicken Wings it's a roll of the dice wether your wings will be undercooked and slimy or overlooked and dry The wait staff tells me this is one of the biggest complaints they get  Unfortunately after years of complaints management can't seen to get it rightLook elsewhere if you want good quality Chicken Wings (Wingstop 
3309,0,We came here because of the 5 star feedback and they were nearly walking distance from where we live We were very excited to see a BBQ joint nearby but were highly disappointed with the food Being from KC I know what good BBQ taste like and some of the best places are set up like this one but this wasn't even close when it came to good or even acceptable BBQ They had a huge smoker in back but it wasn't used for the BBQ we had Since we live very close we really wanted to like this place because the closest decent BBQ place is 20 miles away We bought a sample plate because we love BBQ and wanted to get a good idea of what their's was like The food tasted old like it was warmed up from days before and it had a lot of grease on it The beans had a weird aftertaste to them and also had an old burnt taste The smoker in back was for show only because the food tasted like it was done in an oven a week before Like I said very disappointed don't waste your money.
2675,1,I don't do sexy well All of my attempts at seduction end in horrible awkwardness Drunk on sake from Nobuo I attempted to give my boyfriend the ol' bedroom eyes He told me later that I acted like a mid-range call girl the entire evening My BAC was partially due to my empty stomach and patially due to previous alcohol consumption We had already been waiting an hour and a half for Pizzeria Bianco and a bottle of wine later we decided to get some sustenance to help us through the next hour and a half of the wait While I wasn't making a spectacle of myself we enjoyed the Teeter Tots and Steamed Pork Buns Our waiter was an expert in the field of sake and helped us pair these two dishes with a great bottle of the stuff The Teeter Tots Panko crusted tofu with a dipping sauce were so good I always look for a similar menu option at every Japanese place we go to now but nothing has come close Now I admit I do not normally like steamed pork buns But I was drunk and in the mood for adventure so I gave these guys a shot Second best  outcome of an intoxicated decision everGet frisky at Nubuo if you have the chance.
27,0,Got food poisoning off a simple Caesar salad Worst food poisoning I've ever seen When my boyfriend called to inform the manager he didn't seem to care and told us he would get back to us but didn't I work on mill and will never be back If you do go don't get a salad.
2543,0,OMG what a madhouse  Did the organizers REALLY not know how many people were going to show up or how many Groupon Living Social and 'free w/Spring Training' tickets were being given out  ReallyI would have given it two stars because two of the trucks we actually got food from (after waiting 15 hours each) had really really tasty food (Jamburritos and Tom's BBQ) but even both of those were out of some of the items we wanted before we got to the front of the line  (And one of those was at about 12:30pm less than 3 hours after opening with more than 3 hours to go)  As the afternoon of waiting wore on and more and more trucks ran out of food entirely that put even more pressure (and longer waits) for the ones that did still have something to sellNot only that but the mercenary beverage vendors were charging the same $4 for water as they were for a beer in the Happy Hour tent  What a jokeI am only grateful I didn't pay to get in.
1276,1,Wow Yeah I said wow This was some really good Chinese food It is payday and my coworkers wanted to go out to lunch One of them was craving Chinese food So Yelp to the rescue We found this place and my coworker realized she used to go here all the time and said it was good So off we wentIt is close to work so that is good The prices weren't bad so that is good Decor was nice a little dark inside but still good The tables had tablecloths with Chinese Zodiac place mats on them with a sheet of glass or plexiglass covering all of it Everyone was checking their signs and their families signs and joking around about it A nice distraction while waiting for our order Service was great They had no problem doing multiple checks and the food came out pretty quick So did the drinks The wait staff which I think were the owners were very attentive Drinks always refilled and asking us if we worked in the area and where we worked Also asked us if we had been there before When we said no they brought us over take out menusNow to the food It was so good Best Chinese food I have had in awhile I ordered the Moo Goo Gai Pan The white sauce that was on it was amazing The chicken and veggies were perfect and the fried rice was really good Everybody raved about their different meals Not one complaint They got us in and out with plenty of time to get back to work That was even with 5 people in our groupI will definitely be back to try everything else on the menu So far away from that other Panda it isn't even worth mentioning Even cheaper then them too Great find High five coworker.
2176,1,Been a fan of Frank Lloyd Wright for many years I've visited Falling water and Knob Hill (which is simply fantastic) both in Pennsylvania Also toured his home and other locations in Chicago I've yet to be disappointed The guides are always extremely knowledgeable and they have great anecdotes which help to make the tours fun My parents have recently moved down (snow birds) to Arizona and I look forward to taking the tour again in the future  It is expensiveactually when I went last year my parent's waffled on whether to spend the money because they weren't terribly interested  In the end they decided to go and they were fascinated and glad they took the tour It's worth it to support Taliesin and the conservation of these wonderful works of art.
3451,0,We should have read the Yelp reviews before going to this place but after now 2 bad experiences I feel the need to write a review DO NOT go here The first time we went it was to get  new tubes for my bike We even brought a tube in so we would get the correct size replacements This older man working at the counter was like a Mr-Know-It-All barely looking at the tire and spouting off what size he thought it was Then he goes to the back and gets us the replacement tubes which we bought then brought home Upon putting these tubes on my bike they were the wrong size So back we went to exchange them yet they apparently ran out of thorn resistant tubes for my Schwinn so we bought the regular ones Funny thing is this man told us that they are the only bike shop in PHX to carry thorn resistant tubes for Schwinn yet we weren't sure why they had none in stockA week later the tubes popped and we went back to get replacements again And again this useless man gave the wrong size We are bringing them back now and telling him we are never go back there again There are plenty of other better bike shops in PHX and ScottsdaleI'll just find one with good ratings on Yelp.
4450,0,I was hoping this restaurant would be better The biggest problem with this restaurant was the service  We ordered three dishes and a soup as an appetizer I had eaten there once before and wanted to give the restaurant one more try before I gave an opinion The soups tended to be somewhat bland Also we ordered the sizzling rice soup We had to serve the soup ourselves after a bowl was placed on the table The rice was anything but sizzling We also had a problem with one dish being VERY SALTY  We complained to our waiter and she removed the dish as requested Unfortunately we were still charged for this dish and no accommodations were made to correct our complaints The atmosphere is fun and hip but the service will make me not go back to this restaurant I hope they higher more professional accommodating servers.

2456,1,"I'm not sure why it took us so long to try this place  We used to live close to this place but didn't try it until we left  Sure this is a chain restaurant but it knocks it out of the park for meThe restaurant is very nice on the inside and the food matches  I always order the chile rellenos and they are stellar Usually we order the avocado cream dip for an ""appetizer"" to go with the chips that come to the table  It's probably just avocado with sour cream mixed in but it is so flipping good."

2062,1,Best acai bowl in Arizona Jamba Juice acai toppers don't countI think they blend grapes into theirs which really thins them out Thrive makes them perfectly and uses fresh ripe fruit I would come here everyday but my wallet would protest It is a bit of a splurge for a broke college student but definitely worth it Friendly staff and great acai bowls.

4389,0,Well my daughter and I went in for lunch We arrived at 2:13pm We were seated and the table was not too clean The hostess came over and asked for our drink order I asked which lunch specials came with a drink she then informed me that the lunch specials were over at two  I told her I thought the lunch specials lasted till four I asked her if they would honor the lunch specials since it was only 13 minutes after two and was told no I explained to her that I would leave if I didn't get the special She shrugged as if she didn't care and we walked out The sad part is that I eat at this place three maybe four times a month The food is great and the staff is always friendly I'm really disappointed I hope they were happy that Wendy's got my $16 for lunch.

3181,0,Terrible terrible service Will not go back It wasn't even crowded for Saturday Brunch We waited and waited for eggs and after 45 minutes left The server checked back with us once to left us know our food was on the way but it never came Hugely disappointed Will not recommend to friends and won't take my out of town guests there either.
2821,0,"Stopped in while engagement ring shopping with my fiancee's sister Was greeted buy a guy with lots of unsightly tattoos and big hoops in his ear not exactly the type of person to sell jewelry but I kept an open mind We asked to see a couple rings and their price he slid a catalog toward us and said ""they're all in there"" He then walked away and talked on his cell phone behind the counter toward the back He ignored us from there I was ready to drop thousands on a ring but couldn't get the time of day On the way out a lady asked if we had been helped It's a small shop so the service was so bad they didn't even realize someone had helped us I said ""sort of"" and just walked out The staff should be ashamed of their behavior."
3636,0,Stood outside the store at 7pm the other night while the employees stood there and looked at me from inside Granted they close  at 7 but a little acknowledgement is what keeps customers I had called before 7 and no one answered so I ran over to exchange my box Cox it's a competitive market out there Maybe the other cheaper services out there won't be so arrogant.
3553,0,Not one but TWO times had to drive back around and give them back the food they handed me Two times they gave me someone else's food Every time I tried to check they told me they were busy and that I needed to pull forward if I wanted to check I just wanted to try their salad Every fast food restaurant has the ability to make a decision: are you going to be as bad as everyone expects or are you going to take the time to do it rightWendy's of 301 E Indian School I hope you read this Moreover I hope you try harder to take the time to do it right I believe in you.
2690,1,What a great place Bigger better The Belgian waffles are amazingalway the same wonderful flavor and consistency The staff couldn't be nicerI wish I could eat here every day.
59,1,"YES YES NY Pizza for sureUpon entering I was greeted by a very nice straight forward lady I made it known that i was visiting from NYC and i heard great things about this place and she said (very confidently) you heard right and you wont be dissapointed Oh boy was she right One bite and i was back in Manhattan Too bad i been eating out of the other ""NY"" places around here this whole time :( So good I wish you guys the best So mad I only ordered 2 slices."
1071,1,Last chance the only bargain basement you will ever go to and see women with high end louis vuittons + chanel bags digging for cheap finds A couple reasons why I love last chance: $200 basic tee shirts and tanksGreat price jackets last time I was there I scored 3 north face jackets for $3000 each Shoe selection is great sometimes if you are extra lucky your shoe size might be going for an additional 50% this happened to me once and I walked out with 12 pairs of shoes High end Jeans/Slacks/Trousers are normally in the $2000 - $3000 range A couple reasons why I hate last chance Anxiety level goes up when women trample over me and plot to steal from my cartMen's section is sparse but non existent The line to the private changing room is painfully long (if you are uncomfortable changing in their open changing area) Many items are badly damaged (holes rips stains) so everything you buy must be examined very very carefully Bag selection there is pretty terrible prices are very high for Last Chance's standards and bags are often broken in bad shape or need repairs All in all if you are looking for a good/anxiety filled/thrifty day of shopping This place is IT.
850,1,I just tried this restaurant for the first time It was delicious I ordered the raw vegan sushi and a raw dessert I thoroughly enjoyed my dish and I also tasted my dates dish which was the raw wrap and that too was yummy Great service nice clean atmosphere I will be returning many more times BTW I am a raw vegan and have been a vegan for 8 years so I have tried my fair share of vegan and raw vegan restaurants.
1957,0,A bookstore in a mall genius  WRONG not when you work there and your General Manager is a selfish idiot   I have not been back since I left this horrible job but I do hope that things have straightened themselves out and that they fired that bitch Marcie    I  mean what kind of company keeps a General Manger who walks out of her store seeing a line that has grown 20 people deep with the phones ringing off hook and not to mention the lack of staff on the sales floor to assist those growing impatient customers  I can't even tell you how many times I had to take customer complaints about the lack of staff   As far as product they might say they have it but good luck at finding it  These high school seniors and freshman college students they hire have far better things on their minds (themselves) and could care less where they have shelved  that book you are now looking for   Now if it's a best seller you'll have no problem finding it since it will be displayed on tables and end-cap displays through out the store and depending on the season possibly displayed in a floor stack as wellafter all they did receive 50 copies of the book to begin with and receive an additional 12 when 1 is sold As for  CD's and DVD's since you are already at the mall I would recommend going somewhere else as they are far over priced at any BordersThe only thing I would rave about is the magazine selection  The Biltmore location will provide you with the widest variety but all locations have a ridiculous amount of titles.
1015,1,Always have armen cut my hair Always good and professional guy Highly recommend.
2505,1,The hubby and I stayed here on our wedding night We didn't arrive until midnight or so (we partied late :)) and the service was still impeccable After our car was valeted and we were golf-carted down to our casita we were left to enjoy our night of solitude The room itself was beautiful king sized bed fireplace patio overlooking the golf course vanity ipod dock jetted tub separate shower and plush robes and slippers We ordered room service probably close to 1 am and it arrived promptly The boy ordered the veggie wrap (he said it was delish) and I ordered the tossed greens salad with balsamic For $13 the salad was a total miss Just a few mediocre lettuce leaves tomatoes onions and cucumbers thrown on a plate I was hungry though so it workedThe next morning we slept in as late as we could I woke up with the worst heartburn (thanks balsamic) so I called the front desk for some Tums No problem they arrived pronto We packed up and called for a ride and although they said they were busy they arrived shortly after I would love to come back here and stay a little longer The service was great the place was beautiful and for the one night we were there it was damn perfect.
4477,0,"Went there for the first time last week at the suggestion of the person I was meeting  She got there early and had a salad before I arrived  When I arrived she said it was not very good and didn't recommend the food so I just got iced tea and a muffin which was good  My friend went up to get me a refill and told the person that her salad was not good  His answer ""sorry"" and that was it  He also told her he would have to charge her for another iced tea  I've never been to a place where they don't give you free iced tea refills  He had every opportunity to turn the situation around by offering my friend something else or a coupon for next time or not charging me for my tea - but he did none of that  I wouldn't go back and neither would my friend."
4736,0,if I could give this restaurant zero stars I would  It was that bad  We had gone for my birthday  and it was our first time there  They sat us right by the kitchen after i specifically asked for a nice table The food was inedible  And that is putting it kindly  I even wrote a letter to the owner and manager and never heard back from them  It was like taking $ 150 and burning it in front of me  NEVER AGAIN.
2651,1,This is one of my favorite hangouts The staff is always friendly and have great memories and social skills It is nice to always be greater with a smile and warm greeting no matter who is working This coffee shop has amazing pastries made from scratch daily with a good variety I have never had a problem finding an available outlet which is pretty rare in a coffee house so centrally located and that does good business You wont be disappointed Cute and has a lot of character.

3530,0,Just not goodOrdered 2 wings which came with 2 sides I chose macncheese and refried beans  Wings were fried slightly overcooked and had no flavor  No salty no seasony nothing  Macncheese tasted a couple of elbow noodles swimming in warmed cream with a tablespoon of actual cheese plopped in the cup  Refried beans were soupy and slightly undercookedAlso ordered a wing drumstick thigh which came with 2 sides which were chosen as fries and corn on the cob  The man agreed his chicken was also slightly overcooked no salt no seasony nothing   Fries were that cool spiral cut concept but were chewy greasy and soggy  Corn was corn hahaI was hopeful that they would have a different style of fried chicken like at Pollo Campero  Eek Methinks not  At the end of the meal we came to the consensus they got everything they attempted wrong absolutely wrong  Im sad for them :( and sad for my $1500 dollars  I didnt even wanna write this review however I know this is exactly what Yelp is for  I took one for the team tonight  We win most and we lose some I definitely lost tonight.
2400,1,"We took our daughter out to celebrate her 1st day of school and she wanted pizza We had heard about La Calabria and went there They do NOT serve pizza but the hostess (I think it was the owner as well) convinced her that pasta and meatballs would be just as yummy and thankfully today our 3 year old wasn't her typical stubborn self and  went for itmuch to our delight as we had been wanting to try this place THANKS GOODNESS It turned out to be an incredible find for Italian food locally owned 'mom and pop' type of place so close to our homeWe had some wine which was very good and reasonably priced They brought out some soft and fresh Italian bread with some of the most delish olive oil/seasonings dip I've ever hadThe chef (maybe the other owner) came out personally to serve our daughter her meal He offered her the parm sprinkled on her dinner after the 3rd ""yes"" of offering her more he asked if she just wanted the whole bowl which made her very happy Us too it was some of the best parmesean cheese I've ever tasted So fresh and tasty She loved the meatballs said they were as good as Nona's (her Italian grandma) so that says a lot right thereMy husband and I shared one of the daily specials a penne with a sausage and mushroom sauce It was a cross between a red and a white sauce sort of like a vodka sauce but not exactly I don't think they make their pasta from scratch but my oh my you couldn't cook prepared pasta any better It was done perfectly al dente and the sauce was simply INCREDIBLE if I had just one word to choose I'm sure it was more calories/fat than I would care to knowbut it was so good I didn't care It was also great that for a small fee of $5 they let us share giving us both our own salad The pasta portions were still very big we each came home with leftoversWe decided to go for it all and end the night with cappuccino and dessert The cappuccino was perfect nice and large with a wonderful foam They have 4 or 5 homemade in-house desserts but the gelato menu spoke to us We got the bananas foster gelato which was just delectable Perfect banana flavor not too powerful served a little more frozen than usual so it stayed in a wedge shape and half of it was dipped in Italian chocolate and nuts My mouth is watering just remembering it If you live in Gilbert or nearby Chandler and are looking for a family run restaurant with a casual atmosphere and wonderful food give this place a trymy guess is you'll be hooked We can't wait to go back Prices are about the same as Olive Garden or the likenot cheap but not expensivepretty much what you'd expect Oh and the kids meal was a deal at $5 with about 2 to 3 servings for the average child and comes with a 'surprise' which was ice cream and made our daughter very happy a great ending to a milestone day for herand us."
631,1,Great salad buffet The blueberry muffins are always good and hot Too expensive for just salad though Awesome service Warm cookies are a nice touch.
668,1,my boyfriend and i have eaten this menu up and down multiple times- we can't get enoughfirst of all: BEST HUMMUS I HAVE EVER HAD IN MY LIFE i always get it i cant help myself it so good its like a compulsionservice is spotty can take a long time some servers are better than others but the food itself is worth it so we go back time and againall salads= fabulous pastas= fabulous every single kind of burger= amazing all fries = better than you can imaginethis place is my favorite lunch place in phoenix to date.

1223,0,I'm not one to usually complain but I was extremely dissatisfied with this location Got ripped off BIG TIME Make sure you listen VERY carefully and ask as many questions as possible I can't wait to get rid of sprint because of this If you go in make sure you do not get Brian Nice guy but He's a scam artist only interested in getting a sale not worried about your situation .
2245,1,Chef Gerald comes up with some of the most fantastic tasting desserts to suit all palettes    Everything from custom gourmet chocolates to fine pastries Old-World style desserts and more     My personal favorite is the poppyseed cake he makes absolutely fantastic but there is a great deal else that is exceptional and I'm trying out as much as I canas my waistline allowsthis is a really great bakery that definitely deserves a visit.
326,1,Best sashimi eating experience in the Valley When you come to Roka do yourself and favor and spend the extra dollars to get the Omakasi (you can get plain old sushi elsewhere)  After you order be prepared to spend 2-3hours leisurely enjoying your courses  No sense rushing food this good  Skip the soy sauce please--the fish is so fresh and flavorful drowning it in soy would be a terrible waste  The butterfish is perfectly dressed and tuna salmon cuts are so delicate  One particular cut of tuna was so wonderfully marbled it melted upon contact with my tongue  Dessert is just as nice usually you finish with smooth ice cream flavors and fresh fruitI've been here several times now and the service is always on point-waiters are attentive without being in your face  The cocktails are also pretty good  Although I've never tried their wine selection they have enough selection on the menu to pass my inspection.
2232,0,Did not enjoy any aspect of this restaurant Had the shrimp po boy Bland and boring My husband had another sandwich the Vesuvius Also not good Service was slow although the server was nice Oh and no one greeted or seated us Not a big deal but when we decided to seat ourselves no one showed up for at least 5 minutes  Okay drink specials was the only real up side Zero value in the food though.
4839,0,"Worst dining experience in years So upon arrival there is a line outside so I ask my wife to get down and see what the wait is She comes back out and says 15-20 minutes Okay park the truck and wait 45-50 minutes later I'm asking the host & hostess what happened to the 15-20 minute time that we were quoted ""well there was this party of 16 that is just finishing up so"" I then let him know that if that was the case why didn't he communicate that with us So then he says it'll be just 5 more minutes and it was when we were seated in a dirty area Our server brought us our drinks but there was no silverware to stir our coffee After we get silverware then we fail to see our server again for a while Running out of coffee and creamer now we're without beverages while we wait for the food The food comes out but 2 people are missing their meals 15 minutes go by before they get their food both children so that made them feel all warm and fuzzy Oh yeah ran out of coffee again The children's food make it out and our server says that he'll take those off of the bill When the bill arrives he took off the least expensive meal (not the 2 that failed to show up on time) and charged us for an extra orange juice I ask for the manager at this point and let him know that I've just had the worst dining experience in years He apologizes and asks how he can make it right to which I reply do whatever is within your power He discounted the ticket 25% We lost over 2 hours of our day and more considering this is one of three feedbacks that I will be providing The server said he knows the next experience will be better There probably won't be another experience there but I would hope that if there was one that it couldn't get much worse than that."

3432,0,"The club itself is ok and deserves 3 stars It's more of a crowded lounge/bar since there isn't a dance floor but it's a chill place w/ good musicIt's the male bartender that really brought the rating down I would give negative stars if I could He charged me $31 for 2 Hennessey shots whereas the female bartenders charged $37 for 3 Hennessey shots For my other friends he charged $16 for a mixed drink whereas the females charged $7-9 for the same thing When the female bartenders were asked why the male was charging so much more they just said ""he shouldn't be The prices should be the same no matter who you go to"" Apparently not To top it all off I checked my credit card statement today and he decided to add in a nice tip for himself Luckily I was able to easily dispute it w/ my CC company but they are reimbursing me as a courtesy not recouperating the difference from Suede bc they said it'd be cheaper for them since it's a relatively small amount I'll never go back to Suede again and will continue to warn others to do the same."

3631,0,Ok let me just say for a VERY thin crust pizza to start not good at all very disappointed  with is place We waited over a hour for our pizza and it was very bland I from Chicago and have worked at many authentic pizzerias so I'd like to think I have a good pizza perspective I do not recommend  this place and if you are from the east side or Midwest you will not like it I will never come here again Paid 50$ for poor service and poor food You would think in such a prime and up coming location it would be outstanding.
3689,0,What a worthless store 6 customers waiting 3 employees standing around doing nothing but checking customers in And one employee goes home Why does Verizon have a store that don't want to help thier customers The manager johnny Acted like nothing was wrong Does he not realize there are a lot of people that have busy lives and then to be treated like a annoying customer This store should close so busy people don't have to be treated with such disrespect.
463,1,Went in here for a quick lunch came out very satisfied A tender melt in the mouth medium rare sirloin really makes me can't wait to get back to this restaurant and their fresh clam chowder soup is perfection You can't get enough of it When you first walk into this restaurant you will notice the Wild Wild West mark everywhere surrounded with lots of antiques My fav is their personal made lantern that they put in every side of the ceiling It was lovely I definitely will be back for that steak and more.

2444,1,It's probably not worth reviewing Changing Hands since everyone else already has but I can't help myselfAs far as the selection -- well I've seen better at other indie bookstores BUT most of those bookstores don't carry new AND USED books And that in my opinion is what makes Changing Hands rockAnd unlike a lot of other used bookstores Changing Hands actually buys books back at fair prices -- and sells their used book inventory at low prices too The last time I came here I brought three huge boxes of books I expected the workers to get really annoying with me for bringing in so much - but they were nothing but polite And even better I got a $98 store credit I was definitely not expecting thatI also love the staff's choices of books There are always some great finds in there.
3117,0,SmellyLoudPretentious for no good reason at allOverpricedBut the worst thing for someone like me as a vegetarian is that there are perhaps two items on the entire menu from which to choose  I don't mind macguyvering a meal out of the appetizer section but come on All you have is tofu or edamame No thanks.
3885,0,The waiter was fast and attentive  However the food was disgusting  I ordered the beef brisket sandwich  It was bone dry and cooked to the point if being like leather  I ate mid afternoon  I suspect the meat was under a warming lamp for some hours.

2565,1,Wow I am so impressed with the professionalism and personal care that I received here From the very beginning I knew I was in good hands and was not being overcharged or pressured into a thing If you are looking for personal one-on-one care for your vehicle this is the place.
3410,0,This spa was so hard to find There is no good signage on the property to get you there In hindsight that may have been a good thing The place is pretty much a dump Very outdated and I swear it smelled I have no idea why this hotel is known to be so upscale As far as the spa goes I was seriously disappointed and would never go back There are so many beautiful spas in Scottsdaleavoid this one Yuck.

2175,1,"I had to write about the Orange Tree Golf Resort because I own a timeshare unit there  I bought a unit in 1994 and back then they were 1 of about 4 timeshares in Phoenix  Now it seems there are dozens of timeshares in the Phoenix area Currently the resort is in the porcess of upgrading all of the rooms so if you book there ask for an remodeled room  I haven't seen the newly remodeled rooms but based on the old style the rooms are great  The bigest complaint people seem to have about the rooms are the lack of a full kitchen  But keep in mind the Orange Tree was not built as timeshares rather it was a former hotel that went bankrupt The old units had a ""college sized"" refridgerator but the remodeled units will have a full sized refridgerator and flat creen LCD TV The bathroom is the best part of the units with a two person water jet tub and a walk-in shower and television  The resort is in a great location just a few miles from downtown Scottsdale or about a 20 minute drive to downtown Phoenix The on-site restaurant and bar are great and if you are a golfer the course is fantastic."

724,1,My friends and I had a great time here   We stopped in for dinner and drinks because we were staying next do at the San Carlos Hotel   The food was great   I had the Patty melt and my friend had fish and chips  They were delish   The waitstaff was super helpful and friendly  There was life music in the pub/restaurant too.
1476,1,"I thoroughly enjoyed my first visit here The food was ok but the drinks made the night and so did our personable and skilled bartender who did an awesome job in serving teaching and entertaining us while our party of 3 sat at the bar waiting for our table  DRINKS:-I ordered the Persian-My friend ordered the  Citi-zen-Her friend ordered the Moscow Mule which by the way came served to her in a copper mug and a pickle:  the LEGIT WAY to serve any Moscow Mule (shout out to our bartender who informed us of this interesting fact)  My friend's drink was served to her in a martini glass However she asked our bartender to pour her drink into an old fashioned glass since she was a klutz when it came to drinking from martini glasses He willingly obliged but also joked around with the rest of us and asked what drinks we wanted AND what glassware we preferred our drinks in lmao Needless to say he made our drinks really well and really strong: our drinks were the perfect combination of preserving the integrity of the various flavors while packing a strong punch  When our table was called we sadly parted ways and what's worse I completely forgot to ask his name -_-The rest of my experience here was ok We were seated in the little room off of the main dining room I would've preferred to eat at the bar then eat in this small area because it felt closed off from the rest of the restaurant  FOOD:-I ordered the grilled halloumi cheese sandwich-my friend ordered the kale salad-her friend ordered the ""original chopped salad' which apparently has its own Facebook page (click on the FB link located in the online menu on Citizen Public's website) My grilled halloumi cheese sandwich was definitely a frou frou version of the classic dish it was good but it was a bit disappointing only because I didn't know  this type of cheese doesn't melt and I was totally in the mood for some cheesy cheesiness My least favorite part of my dish was the bread it was just too thick tough to chew My friend's kale salad was a complete bust The kale was completely raw which was ok expect it was hardly dressed so alot of the bitterness was still there It was also hardly chopped so there were large pieces of raw and bitter kale to eat The ""original chopped salad was the best dish out of everyone's Each ingredient used is arranged in neat rows and presented to you on a plate  The server then pours the dressing to your liking and proceeds to mix all the colorful ingredients and then serves it to you I'd definitely come back just to sit at the bar and try some more of their interesting cocktails chit chat with the super awesome bartender who assisted us during my 1st visit here and possibly try another food dish or stick to the chopped salad."
1356,1,"I never would have thought a Vietnamese restaurant would put me in the holiday mood but it did I will get to my reasoning but first let me say why I'm giving Rice Paper five stars It's because they have an adorable restaurant with a perfect atmosphere they have delicious food and they have friendly staff Rice Paper is situated on a busy Phoenix road but once inside the adorable little historic house it feels like you've been transformed into a home away from home They restored a historic house and adapted it into a restaurant that can accommodate those looking for a meal or those looking for some cocktails alike The atmosphere is very modern zen-like with each table places perfectly apart from each other quaint light fixtures warming up the restaurant and a long bar with seating and plenty of drinks to choose fromMost importantly is the food The food here is delicious It's the perfect combination of filling yet light We started with the spring rolls and here I must warn you that if you order one that has ""spice"" mentioned at all in the description be warned that they do not go light on the Sriracha The spring roll was delicious but so spicy my mouth burned for a good 20 minutes following I think I also made the mistake of drinking diet coke in attempt to ease the burning but it really only made it worse The burn from Sriracha seems to only disappear if you power through it Rice Paper is know for their Pho so it's a must to order it I went with the chicken Pho and this is where I entered into the holiday spirit The Pho is warm and filled with wintry spices that remind me of Christmas with each warm sip If I closed my eyes I could have imagined looking outside to see a crisp snow-filled day (instead of busy 7th street on a 70 degree day) I actually ordered the vegetarian Pho and added chicken in order to get all the vegetables It was the perfect meal It was filling but felt light and didn't put me into an afternoon food coma I can see Rice Paper being the perfect spot for a date night or lunchtime meeting It's great to stop by for an appetizer and cocktails before heading out for the night or making this your main stop for the night and staying for a meal."
2056,1,MOJO yogurt is just fab Love the flavors love the toppings love that it is all self serveThe only thing I don't love are the giant cups It always makes me buy too much And then eat it My favorite flavor so far is the cookie and the mint one.
4095,0,"Okay I have not given any place a one star review in a while and looking at some of this restaurant's ""friend""ly reviews I am one of the only few that has given this place a one star  Why Overall feeling  A big part of liking or loving a restaurant not just about the food or service  Its the atmosphere and how it makes you feel  Hereit seems out of place  This restaurant is pushing a concept and atmosphere onto downtown phoenix that seems to fit better in Scottsdale  Here in downtown we are a bit more down to earth we like to feel welcomed and comfortable when coming to a restaurantwe don't want to sit upright and nibble on a $5 Chicken wing  And yes it is is WingsingularWith that out of the waylets move onService:  Not ban but not good  The servers were not helping in describing the dishes  Especially for a asian fusion restaurant this is a mustAmbience:  The patio looked greatthe decor was kinda weirdI did not get the music nor the art that was displayed  It did not fit the conceptDrinks:  I didn't even ordernot interestingFood:  I had the Duck Confit  which I have to say one of the worst I have had  It was so oily and flavorlessSpring Roll- how can anyone over soak rice paper It was so soggy I took one bite and that was itLop Xeong Crepe- Again another soggy itemurgghTonkotsu Ramen- This was not done correctlythe broth is too richnot in a good wayDessert-Blueberry Mochi with Lychee sorbet-  Now this was great  The textures and sweetness good balanceAll in all I was really disappointed with this restaurant  I wish the chef/owner would have stuck to something more similar to his other successful concepts which are more in line with his skillsAsian fusion I don't think is his nichethere are many asian fusion restaurants that have better executionThe Mission is one of the best restaurants in Phoenixthat should have been a model when opening a new restaurantthat is what downtown phoenix needs."

1718,1,Dr Perry Fraiman is the most caring and accomodating dentist you will find  Several years ago my husband needed two front crowns replaced  My husband asked for my help choosing the right tooth color  Dr Fraiman said for us to swing by his office and he'd show us the choiceswe even went outside to look at it in natural light  Now where would you find a specialist who would do thatVery recently I had a huge mouth sore  He asked me to pop in at my convenience 3 week in a row to check on it He also gave me a very helpful prescription  His dental work is amazing and his staff is always happy and helpfulCheck him out.
314,1,My family and I ate here after a killer work out at CrossFit Mesa I am the owner of the gym and a big part of my coaching is giving healthy eating advice to my clients I was very pleased to learn that the Mesa Grill Co Had an amazing menu that allowed my family and I to enjoy a healthy Paleo meal in a nice burger joint setting The owner informed me that all the menu items could be made in salad form to avoid any grain or beef could be substituted with a 6oz chicken breast The nice thing is that these options are on the menu their not just winging it it's a menu that has been thought outWe will be regulars at Mesa Grill Co As long as they continue to serve awesome healthy food.

4051,0,"I agree with Cody from Florence   This is the worst customer service (actually lack of) that I have ever encountered  I went there to shop for a baby shower gift  I printed my list from the registry kiosk and stood there trying to figure out the layout (different areas of the store) of the store to find the items i was looking for  The list seemed to make sense but I couldn't locate the section it was telling me to go and very few of their aisles were numbered (not enough to figure out which direction i should go in)  An employee was actually at the end of one of the aisles i was looking in and i was searching very hard for my item and could not find it  I was waiting to see if she offered to help me  she did not i had to ask  I told her what i was looking for showing her the list and she says (sarcastically) ""well its right here but of course the price on the display was NOT the price on the registry list She told ""well it is the item"" and it was the price listed on the registry  So i said well the sign on the display is incorrect then so that was misleading to me   she pulled out her pricing gun put a new tag on the display (with quite a lot of noise) and said very sarcastically ""have a nice day"" and stomped away  Another customer and I just looked at each other and shrugged our shoulders  So onward I go throughout the store trying to find the location of another item and not finding the aisle  Couldn't find any employees and I went to ask the cashier if she could direct me  She said ""just look at the numbers on the end of the aisle""  of course they were not there   She came to see that for herself and said ""i don't know why they are not there you'll have to just go look for it""  Finally my shopping completed I went to the register area--no cashier at any of the registers but i see the previous cashier at the customer service desk on the computer with her back to the area  Excuse me i said several times finally she turns around to acknowledge me and says are you ready to check out  very rudelyI will NEVER go back into that store EVER."
1781,1,I've been enjoying Gina's Homemade since I came across their biscotti at the Old Town Farmer's Market back in the season of 2010-2011 They slowly began introducing other products like Gina's amazing meat sauce and their fantastic cheeses and I was officially in love Since they opened their retail shop I've stopped in when I don't feel like making dinner but I want something special and always come out with more than I intended Gina's burrata is creamy silky and just perfect The lasagna made with fresh house-made ricotta is simple and old-school No frills needed--just great cheese pasta and sauce I also love the variety of pizzas they have available and have yet to pick a favorite honestly I also like that you can complete your meal with a bottle of great wine or grab some truffle butter for well anything (I'm a sucker for good truffle butter) If you haven't gotten to Gina's yet it's worth a trip--whether it's to their cute little retail location or to one of the local farmer's markets in Phoenix & Scottsdale.
4991,0,Order new Pretzel cheeseburger with fries  Burger was cold and disgusting and fries were cold and rubbery  It's a hit or miss with this Wendy's  I should of driven further and gone to a different one.
4307,0,Very disappointing and expensive  We went there on Sunday and didn't realize our only choice was the Sunday Super menu for $35 That is way too much for fried chicken especially when 2 of 3 pieces are wings I've had better at KFC The menu on their website was also different than the one we got in the restaurant Had I known we couldn't  choose from the regular menu I would have gone on a different day.
2163,0,We came here the night before our marathon after looking at the reviews and then seeing they made fresh pasta  We were excited as we walked in The place has a cool look and our server was nice Negative 1 - there was absolutely no hot tea selection and the server had no idea what tea they had I usually never get tea but decided to this time The tea was some cheap brand and was presented completely unorganizedNegative 2 - the chop salad is not chopped and its more like a side salad on a large plateNegative 3 - the beat salad was more of a greens salad with some sorry looking off colored beets on the side The salad tasted like one big biteNegative 4 - the meat and cheese plate that says a selection of such is not so We received to thin slices of salume and two thin slices of prosciutto The cheese was cheese sticks and the majority of the plate was veggies The artichokes were the best on the plateNegative 5 - the so called house made pasta is either not house made or the cooks in back do not know how to cook pasta We got risotto with shrimp and the shrimp was so over cooked that is was inedible  Then we got the trio of pastas Tasted like generic microwaved pasta And was like mush We didn't finish either plateNegative 6 - we didn't want to attempt dessert and i wanted itThis place lacks any food luster We were so disappointed and bummed We couldn't figure out how we spent $90 I suggest if you must go to just go to the barI gave them one star because of the artichokes and our water glasses were never empty In conclusion this place is just not good.

4642,0,"We stopped into Kozy Cactus the other day for lunch It's not one of our favorite places but they have some interesting things on the menu and they try hard to be ""local"" and organic At least they used to The menu we were handed had been cut in half and everything but bar food was gone We asked the waitress what had happened and she said that the management had changed but the name remained the same Since we had our Restaurantcom coupon with us we decided to staynot a great decisionWe ordered wings with sauce on the side chili onion rings and a patty melt We waited and waited some more and the place was not very busy When our wings came they were slathered in sauce but we didn't want to send them back and risk waiting another half hour Silly us the sauce was awful It seemed to be a mixture of marinara and bbq to the detriment of each Too bad because the wings themselves were decent Ken said the chili recipe was totally changed - it had no seasoning other than ""hot"" No onions or cheese were offered with it and our waitress was too busy chatting to come to our table for a request The onion rings were dripping with grease and like the hamburger way too saltyThere are bars that serve way better food at much lower prices I suggest you find one And don't be fooled by the name Like I said it ain't Kozy anymore."
166,1,I've known Misty for two decades (does that show my age) and she is the only person who is allowed to touch my hair besides myself I'm always wanting new looks and custom dye jobs and she is never hesitant to follow alongLast week I decided I wanted purple throughout the underneath of my hair and my usual blonde weave on top It's a complicated process and time consuming but she's a pro and can mulit-task The best thing about her talent is she won't finish until your hair is perfect And she's not afraid to tell you like it is She won't let you walk out of the salon with some celebrity hairstyle that does not fit your features and would just look ridiculousMisty is caring thoughtful and listens She gives great advice on how to maintain a style and give proper hair care The products she carries are top of the lineI take my fickle teenage daughter to Misty as well She changes her mind about her hair just as much as I do Misty lets my daugter know what is realistic and what is just poor teenage fads But no matter what my daughter is pleased and her friends are always wanting the same thing Last week Misty did a vibrant red and it was stunnyHer prices are reasonable and you receive that high level of customer satisfaction The salon is inside Signature Studios and Misty is always offering snacks and beverages for her clients She takes care of you.
1114,1,This review is a bit lateI first stayed at the Boulders back in 2004 when it was owned by Wyndam Hotels I have visited 10 times in the last ten years I usually stay in the resort homes I have never had a bad experience They provide the best customer serviceI recently traveled there in September Andrea is the reservationist that booked us a fabulous house and gave us a great rate It was above and beyond of what I thought I would get Patty in housekeeping took all my calls and sent out great people to assist us The room service food is greatMy first massage at the spa was just ok The rest of my treatments were a bit better but I don't feel they are worth the price You have to sign your receipt with 20 percent tip before your treatment It's no longer the Golden Door Spa but a Hilton spa Always ask about a special for treatmentsGo to the big mall in Scottsdale and shop .

1021,1,Absolutely beautiful propertyNow that they have been renovated I am going to frequent the property every year By far my favorite Hyatt to date Their rooms are large and their balcony is the biggest yet They offer a table you can enjoy breakfast at and two lounge chairs to tan on (If it isn't scorching hot)They have 20+ pools One of them is a beach pool that has sand entering the pool which I think is pretty awesome they have a great grotto and the COOLEST WATER SLIDE EVER You go like a million miles per hour and basically fly off of the slide so hold on to your swimsuit Ha And did I mention the pools are open 24/7 YES 24/7 How awesome is thatNow don't let me forget about their Front Desk and Pool staff All of them were smiling and very helpful Upon check-in we were offered Prickly Pear margaritas that were not stingy on the alcohol and full of flavor Loved themI can say so many great things about this property but of course you just have to experience it for yourself Enjoy.

1663,1,The concept of this place is perfect- eating healthy food designed by Dr Weil a foremost physician dealing in true Hippocratic medicine (food) The dishes are indeed healthy and very delicious most of the time This particular location had some inconsistencies with their food preparation that left me unimpressed The server was strange and intense which didn't help My five star review is for how the manager handled our gripes Ryan the manager took care of us very well and was able to assure us of fantastic future visits My husband and I love this restaurant and hope the next time we're out in Arizona they live up to their usual reputation of great healthy food Thanks Ryan.
2937,0,While on vacation in Scottsdale we visited The Sweet Tooth Fairy  What a BIG disappointment I will say this place was bright and airy and had a nice decor but that's the only reason they get even one star  We purchased 12 cup cakes - there were six of us and we thought we would save the other six for the next day  Kids will eat anything and our four kids took one bite and threw the remainder of the cupcakes away and were happy when we thew out the rest of the uneatten cakes  Cup cakes were dry and OLD  The cakes tasted like they sat in the frig for days  Very disappointing  On top of all this the service sucked   There were six of us picking out cupcakes so we were taking a little time - one impatient customer (the only other person in the place) asked if she can just pick out her one cup cake because she only wanted one - before I could even answer the lady that was helping me said sure gave her the cake and said it was on the house - making us feel like we were the problem that she was compensating her for  This was a BIG waste of our money.

2319,1,I knew I wasn't trippin' when I saw a skinny dancing banana at the house party I went to last night A because I was sober (boooo) and 2 because it was Halloween But today right in the middle of a post Halloween funk/Sunday blues combo I started to wonder if maybe I was slipped something last night when Mr Incredible who was there too greeted me at Pink Spot To protect his identity I won't say who it was but the tomato egg bacon avocado sandwich with chipotle mayo sprouts and American cheese on wheat bagel he made me truly hit the spot and the mocha was just what I needed to lift me out of my forlorn state It's a good thing they have free wi-fi here because that's why I'm yelping I'm going to go ahead and throw a solid five stars at these guys because they genuinely accomplished something that trumps taste price or ambiance they served up a generous helping of good humor And it wouldn't hurt to up their star count a little after that dreadful Megan D imposed her two stars Who does she think she is anyway trolling around Phoenix handing out miserable reviews Wait go back to that happy place Dugaldo Happy place Pink Spot.
1530,1,1st time here came in 45 mins before they close but Krista was great about us staying until 7:20 to finish our cheese plate & prosecco She was willing to chat about cheese & their shop as long as we would engage her even though she had things to do for closingWe had the cheese board and Krista cheerfully replaced a newer Gouda with an aged Gouda we had enjoyed sampling She suggested the prosecco with our choices which was a great idea We had Ewephoria a sweet mild smooth sheep's milk Gouda Gorgonzola Picante a cow blue cheese and an aged Gouda we didn't take note of but it was butterscotch-y crystals throughout (yum) and very orangeThey do have a great selection of beers and wines olive oils jams etc and they have great product & offerings expansion ideas as the business profitsWE WILL BE BACK.
2038,1,Oh man  So good  Went here on my birthday and went all out with the rock lobster and filet combo  Holy crap  It is amazing  We also had crab cakes as an app and my boyfriend got the crawfish ettouffe (sp)  Everything was super yummy the server was great (Thanks Alex) and the restaurant ran like a well oiled machine  Can't wait to go backPS- get a Bellini.
2893,1,A little surprise in my Sacks sack today: an extra cookie  They usually just include one cookie but I guess I got the hook-up  That and it was Facebook drink day meaning I mentioned the occasion and got a free drink out of itSacks continues to be well staffed with nice folk and innovative with their sandwiches  I'll definitely keep them at 5 stars because at their price bracket they offer a serious and original sandwich  I'm still buzzing from the ice tea I had at lunch (or maybe it's the extra cookie).
1292,0,We tried Biscuits on Gilbert Road near Sam's Club about a month ago We are still in shock from the food (How do you screw up biscuits and gravy) The potatoes were ok The biscuits gravy and eggs all had a very strange taste similar to the smell of a cafeteria while cleaning almost like old dishwater We just drove by on our way from Sam's Club and their parking lot was quite full Hopefully we just hit a day they gave bad news to the cook otherwise most of these cars were first timersNeedless to say we most probably will not try it again there are too many very good breakfast places around.

777,0,Someone needs to tell the folks that own this place to stop right now and get out before they lose all their money Sunday brunch buffet was unedible The potatoes were something to the tune of fossilized rubber of which both my friend and I spit into our napkins at the same time The omelet I'd gotten from the omelet bar they had set up was swimming in a POOL of butter/grease/margarine() I tried to blot off some of said grease but after one bite my taste buds said ' nooooo way' Also got a waffle from the omelet bar and I could have done better w/ a frozen toaster waffle at home (which I haven't eaten since childhood and didn't enjoy them then) The iced tea was a winner So was the sliced pineapple  I support independently owned businesses and am sad to say I don't imagine this place being around much longer Waitstaff was friendly but probably confused at taking away plates of food w/ one bite out of things  We went to Matt's Big Breakfast afterward and left satisfied happy and full So Squash Blossom I had high hopes for you.
4514,0,"This place is cheesy cheesy ""Daryl's OK used cars"" type of feel They have about 67 sketchy characters trying to wash your car at once and the end result is a car with water spots I was very upset with how poorly they handled the simple task of washing my car The worst part of the whole thing: THEY STOLE 6 QUARTERS I HAD IN MY CUP-HOLDER If you are a recently paroled felon or person who has no hope for a decent shot at a career- get a job at Danny's on E Highland Ave I tried this because my regular car wash is closed on Sundays I would recommend everyone go to Hot Shots on 16th street The management there has some integrity requirements when they hire employees."
4671,0,"Since the day Zaytoon opened I've been a regular customer If I happened to be in the neighborhood I would stop there every time Many times I'd driven across town specifically to go to the restaurant it was that goodThere was one thing that separated them from all the rest The bread Much to my dismay after driving across town one evening last week to have dinner I was given their ""new"" pita When I asked where the regular bread was I was told the new owners/manager didn't want to be bothered making that bread any longer Here is a perfect example of shortsightedness In order to not be bothered with what I guess is an extra step or two in making a superior product the customer base will now begin to disappear When I said to the girl that that was the main reason I come across town for their restaurant she told me that many people were upset and complaining and said they would no longer be coming to the restaurant I told her she could add me to that list Their hummus recipe also appears to have changed And not for the better They are now simply a mediocre Mediterranean restaurant like all the others."

3032,1,I have had two experiences with the ER at JCL one to take a good friend in because it turned out he had internal bleeding a week after surgery from another hospital and more recently because my wife had high fever and nausea that was the result we discovered of pneumoniaIt also happened to be this past Valentine's day when the second happenedBoth times the staff did not screw around We were in a room and under care almost immediately The nurse and staff was extremely attentive ran all of the appropriate tests and made an accurate diagnosis that yielded immediate results all of which without a single error or any interaction that I could possibly complain aboutI have a great deal of respect for the medical staff that has helped my loved ones at John C Lincoln and I can confidently recommend their Emergency Room to anyone in need of one(Thank you Karen).

3151,0,Wow I never would have expected a hotel this dirty and unsanitary I am not one to be picky when getting a cheap hotel but holy smokes was this place nasty The shower was clogged the bathroom had hair all over it by the bunches the kitchen was not cleaned the bed had stains all over it The television didn't get every channel and the homeless people didn't help I'm just stunned at such filth Please do follow my advice and avoid this dump It was straight out of a movie.
1990,1,I love this farmers market  Sure it is smaller then some of the other markets but everyone is very friendly and they are ever growing  It is the best one in the SE valley for sure  Thanks to vendors such as Desert Root Farms One Mill Farms and Rhiba Farms (wheat grass specialists) it is a must for my eating and juicing needsThank you to the operators of GFM Jessa and Dan for a great job in keeping it friendly and to a high standard.
1726,1,I thought I would update this review because after over two years this is still one of my favorite restaurants I have never had a bad or eh meal here and I have always had great service My favorite is still the orange chicken The crab wontons are still amazing I also now have a few new favorite there The sweet and sour chicken is actually pretty good and I am not usually a fan The five vegetable fried rice could be a meal in itself The berries flambe for dessert are really good The duck is good but not fantastic like the other dishes I also like the wonton soup It always has enough pork and wontons in it and has a nice kick If you sign up for their newsletter you do not get bombarded with emails but will get a coupon for your birthday and emails with announcements for holiday specials about 3 times a year For the holidays they also offered a gift card special.

695,1,I love this place I go for the lunch specials Teriyaki Fried Rice and Orange chicken Yum 599 and it comes with a drink I go there so often the two owners know me by name Great local chinese food They call themselves Chinese fast food so don't expect all of the menu items of a nice sit down restaurant The quality of the food is worthy of a sit down restaurant though I would give them 6 stars if I could I'm obsessed :D.
3561,0,I don't even want to give one star but you can't post if you don't mark anything so against my better judgement one star under protest it will beI have to say I will NEVER go back to this place again I don't know if management has changed but I can tell you that the service here has been continuously declining over the past year and TONIGHT was the W-O-R-S-T They definitely need to have 2 people behind the sushi bar because the one person thing just doesn't cut it Even when the place is almost empty it takes FOREVER to get your sushi We've lived in Goodyear now for almost 7 yrs meaning when we first moved to this side of the valley there were no restaurants especially sushi places until the last 3 yrs maybe When this place first opened we were so excited because it was much closer to home at the time the service was excellent and fast and the quality and quantity was worth the price Forget that You'd be better off going to the grocery store and buying their sushi We ordered a total of 4 count them 4 rolls tonight The first roll was delivered rather quickly Nice surprise however it wasn't one of the ones I had ordered so I waited patiently The second roll again not one that I had ordered was delivered probably within the next 500 minutes later Wow we thought Service seems a little better than last time BIG MISTAKE FOR THINKING THAT Holy crap sat waiting for almost another 30-35 minutes watching all these other orders going out for people who came in some time AFTER yes I said AFTER we did but not our 2 measly rolls We also had to be our own server when it came to refilling our drink Server never came back to refill so I got up and refilled our drinks myself Too bad we didn't order alcohol because i would have gone back to get that as well I finally decided I had had enough and we got up to leave When I was approaching the female server to ask for a bill for the sushi we did get and explain the situation she walked right by me like I was invisible or something She came past me a second time and when I started to speak to her she ignored me and walked over to a table that was cancelling an order because it was taking too long for them as well When she walked past me the 3rd time and ignored me I happened to mention in a loud voice that I must be standing there for my health or something Finally I walked over to the curtain that they have to divide the register kitchen and hall to bathrooms from the dining area and told the lady we wanted to cancel our order wanted the bill for what we got and that we would never come back again because service was so horrible She said OK thank you so we walked out Hey wait a minute I think they owe me money since I had to play waitress You know we love and I mean love sushi but I'd rather have to drive out of the way to a place where I know we will get service promptly and with a smile even if the place is packed to the gills no pun intended.
872,1,I love korean food but I love cheap delicious korean food even more They have variuos rice bowls on the menu and some platter options I haven't tried yet The bolgogi bowl is very tasty and with the yelp check in offers we also got 2 free refreshing iced green teas The place is clean and has a back/side area with more seating I still have to go and check out their other bowls and happy hour so there will definitely be an update.
4832,0,Bleh I can't believe this place has so many good reviews The quality of the food is very poor (I think their appetizers come from the freezer section of the grocery store) anne the preparation is even worse- meat and beans have hardly any flavor and the fried items are cold limp and greasy You'd think that would be enough but no- the menus table and silverware were dirty I would've walked out but it was someone's birthday Service was mediocre The only things positive were some of the decor and rooms to facilitate large parties.
738,1,This place rocks on Tuesdays with $1 tacos and cheap drinks  Try the Lobster Sampler Platter (if you're not going for the $1 tacos on Tuesdays)Chips and Salsa and right on everyone friendly ok for kids in the restaurant section  Has a little patio and an upstair couchy loungey bar area (never been there for drinking but I did sneak upstairs with my son to check out the layout -- it's a habit I have of pacing out real estate)  Would be a perfect place to rent out for a party or event probably holds like 40 seated standing room for another 30 or so).
1505,1,This place is Fn amazing The boy took me here for my birthday dinner and literally I cannot think of any other place I would have rather been at We went late 9pm rez It was an amazing evening so we sat outside near the fireplace You seriously have to sit outside it's almost like you're in another state on vacation with how secluded it is Each table gets its own heat lamp too by the way We started with a bottle of Champagne and the sommelier there was so cool Loaded with suggestions and just a really friendly dude We also started with the Mussels and Foie Gras - both equally amazing The mussels were delicious I LOVE mussels and ever since I left Boston I haven't had any good ones these were awesome I wanted more The Foie Gras was obviously delicious  Prepared to perfection and it was gone in less than 30 seconds For our entrees I got the lamb and B got the Beef Tenderloin For our sides we got the Mac n Cheese & Grilled Asparagus I'm not even kidding when I say that we did not leave ONE bite on our plates We devoured everything and all of it was perfect Especially the bottle of wine we split with itTo wrap up the meal we got the crème brulee to share and as my photo shows they personalized it for my special day That along with 2 glasses of port and we were good to go Staff don't mess around they are at your beck and call from the moment you pull up to valet I will say this place is not cheap and seemingly only appropriate for special occasions however I will absolutely go back again and again and again birthday or not Seriously one of the most delicious dinners ive ever had period.
1270,1,This was recommended by my friend Kristin - who is an overall pet lover who has the happiest pets that I know ofso naturally I had to check it outThey have a great selection of everything overall and of course for an pet boutique - the latest in all of the hot trends for pets What I enjoyed is that they carry some specialty brands of shampoo that are organic and great for sensitive skin They were very helpful in pointing out so many things to me since I was a new pet owner and needed some attention and remedial dialogueOf Max was in heaven at this shop - all of the doggie treats and goodies are at eyeball level - so he ate hi way through the store and will never forget it.
4294,0,I'm very sure that I will never purchase from this company ever again The following is not the only issue with my purchase however it is the most pressing It's been a month since my return of a mattress that was never even delivered to my home and they have had unknown problem after problem processing my return which has stalled the return of my moneyFirst the Ahwatukee Store Manager stopped taking my calls Mike was great when I was purcahsing but had Clare speak to me whenever I followed up on my return  claiming that corporate was processing it Then when I called the customer service line the guy brought me to tears Between having no information on a month old return claiming that a Tempur-Pedic base has no warranty and refusing to let me speak to a manager I felt completely de-humanized and powerless As if I would never again see my [significant amount] of moneyAfter harnessing my Google-fuu I found corporate accounts payable who admitted my return had never even been addressed (over a month later) let alone processed and she would bring it to a manager and I'd receive a call in 24hrs No call I just spoke with them only to find out still nothing has been done The only things I can do is call and start speaking up about this unprofessional treatment I feel completely powerless while they sit on my money the Store Manager has his commission and I have nothing But if this continues I will have to look into further and more serious appropriate legal action How do you file a collections claim on a corporation.
316,1,"For such a small ""boutique"" type store they actually have a lot to offer Their accessories and selection of ques stands and wall art are all packed right in without feeling cramped They sell Olhausen pools tables here Due to the limited space the day we were in they only have two in the show room but they allowed us to build our own custom table on their computer We were very impressed by Richard's good advise on the tables options and prices they came in He pretty much showed us everything good/bad about all the different types of rails skirts and stains for each of the designs we picked He even showed us the swatches of felt that we choose to see how they looked on a table The severices and follow-up they sell with the tables appear to be extrodiary compared with other pool table/ billard stores I reccomend them for their customer service we didn't buy a table from them but we are stillin the market so if we do I'll update my review."
2568,1,"The first time I went to the Sail Gentlemen Afterdark was playing a super-rare reunion show and they blew the roof off the place Incredible band if you don't know 'em you're missing out First impressions: the Sail is intimate but also roomy with a decent amount of seating friendly bar staff and great sound It reminded me a lot of the old Wong'sonly less scuzzy (and I know scuzzy was part of the old Wong's charm) The Sail has live music every night with pretty much the best bands in town on a regular basis--a decent-sized indoor stage and a big outdoor stage The Zen Lunatics rule Thursdays with ""Rockaroke""--a live-band karaoke that draws a great (and very diverse) crowd that frequently includes surprise appearances from a variety of well-known local musicians It didn't take long to become a regular Yeah the Sail charges a cover (usually just a couple of bucks which pays the bands and the excellent sound guy)--but the drinks are strong and cheap and they have a variety of good beers on tap It's a small price to pay for good bands every day of the week They go out of their way to support up-and-coming bands longtime valley musicians and visual artists--and it's a fun place to just hang out If you like the best live music and art Tempe has to offer there's no better place to be If you don't I think that Toby Keith's place is open Try the Krispy Fried Macaroni & Cheese."
278,1,I'm new to AZ from GA and I'm currently living in up in the hills so when I get down I like to EAT  I ended up in Pita Jungle by dumb luck and I'm so pleasedI couldn't find the pho place and Tasty Kabob was closed but hey I like pitaI was already happy as it had the same atmosphere as one of my favorite hang-outs in Atlanta  I hoped the food would be as good and ordered the Shwarma Pita with no onions and the garlic potatoes  I'm not a big carb eater but the garlic sounded goodThe chicken had a wood-fired taste without the wood-fired dryness It was poached-moist inside The pita was soft fresh and lined with hummus which blessedly had flavors other than tahini It was delightful  The potatoes had that light crisp browning that gave them just enough structure to *poof* when bitten into  I would've liked to have seen the garlic roasted a little further as there were some bits that seemed a tad raw  There's garlic and then there's *garlic* (eyes cross) Apparently they have a jalapeno cilantro hummus which I think would be delightful on a bagel sammich so I'll be getting some of that to go when I'm back in town  *begins making list*.
3952,0,I always give taco shops a fair shot But omgI think this place only stays in business because of surrounding bars I was completely sober and having a cravingate here for dinner one night (can't speak for breakfast time)  Everything is watered down From the chili sauces to the beans Taco shop looks like a cafeteriavery empty nothing on the walls The chicken was dark meat and mostly fat I will not eat here again Which is a shame because I live so close.
4782,0,Stupidest layout of 4 measly broken down pumps.
517,1,I am in mourning for Fez Not that Fez has gone anywhere I've gone I realize that it's just a restaurant and that there are thousands of restaurants here in LA where I now live But Fez has never been just a restaurant to meFor my family and me Fez has been the kitchen that isn't in our house This is where we go when we need some comfort food and more importantly some comfort We can walk in any time day or night and be cuddled cared for and fed Thomas (the GM for those who don't know him) is a combination of dear friend and goofy brother (younger I guess but I'd never say that to him) Chad the world's most talented actor/waiter/dad always makes us feel wonderful Chad always makes us feel as if his day has improved just because we walk in the doorWhen it was time for the launch of my debut novel there was only one location under consideration - Fez When our anniversary came on the heels of a blown engine and serious crimp in finances we went to Fez for food libation and comfort And when it was time to leave the valley we ate our last dinner at Fez joined by a dozen good friends and hosted by Thomas and ChadSo here I sit in LA wondering if I'll ever find a place like that again I doubt it Fez is just the right mix of people place and food that makes it the rarest gem I'll just have to visit Phoenix from time to time for comfort And food.
4401,0,Worst bar I've ever been to I was here for a bachelorette party and I think it would have been more pleasant in a sewer The bartenders are rude the people are unattractive and dancers have a nasty attitude Also  the toilets in the girls bathroom were overflowing for the 40 minutes we were there No one turned off the water valve on the back of the toilet Some creeper guy just kept mopping up the continuous flow of sewage.
2661,0,Now normally I would not give a whataburger this low of a rating But back in Dec on a vacation I came back from a bar late on a Sunday night went to this whataburger and they had no meat We went to the drive up menu where greeted Told them it would be a minute We took ten minutes and finally when we decided what we wanted we where THEN told they where out of meat Sigh.
4410,0,All I can say is yuck I expect a lot from chain/franchises Maybe the food won't be the highest quality but the service and cleanliness should be right on And it should be fastI went here a couple of times and was dissapointed every single time The last time I went I got a bagel with cream cheese for take out I got home and started eating it and would you believe it it tasted like cigarettes Clearly whoever made it had just been smoking came back inside and made my food without washing their hands Respulsive I didn't even bother to go back to complainI will never give Einsteins my business againLooking through Yelp I see a ton of bad reviews about all of the Einsteins You would think corporate would take these reviews from the general population into some serious consideration We may not be official food critics but we do know what is going on.
2246,1,I love the view food and service here I love dinner and brunch at El Chorro I just adore everything about this restaurant (No the sticky buns are not a draw for me :) I personally think they are weird with wine and dinner-I guess I am not a sticky buns kind of girl) Love the patioThis is one of my favorite places in the valley.
1080,1,This is my absolute favorite place for boba I have been going there for the last year regularly and have tried so many flavors I have a week spot for the Taro smoothy though I am sure I have tried every boba spot from Phoenix to the East Valley and theirs is perfect They manage to get the most perfect evenly textured boba with just the right amount of chewy yumminess I stop by there every time I am going to pass Dobson on the freeway  Its so hard to resistThe diamond ice is great too I love mine with mango I have yet to try their ramen though as I am afraid of holding it to the standard of another shop in Tempe but I'm willing to give it a try.
4226,0,Just when you think airport food is improving-along comes Taberna Del Tequileria Blue corn quesidilla with pork so dry I had to drown it in salsa (in the stupid little cups - like another reviewer pointed out) in order to choke it down $10 'house' maragarita come on-it was a flavorless glass of ice slushGlad to get back to my 'home' airport (PDX) where they have real restauranteurs running their own places that take pride in what they serve.
2406,1,This store is 100% AMAZING It is clean neatly laid out lots of friendly birds and the owner and his staff are absolutely wonderfulI have a bit of a story on how I came to this placeFor Christmas my son decided he wanted a bird A cockatiel to be exact I went to another store in the valley Nice people but it didn't specialize in birds This was my first mistakeWe picked out his bird the day after Christmas and he brought him home It was not hand trained This was my second mistakeMy son worked every single day with his bird Reading to it playing his clarinet to it etc he was meticulous about the birds food/water/cage etc After a month (so just recently) the bird would get on his hand and eat out of it He was SO proudWe found his bird dead in the cage Wednesday night (this bird I was told was less than 6 months old)Needless to say he was pretty heart brokenI called Birdz and Beyond We had a long discussion about what happened the environment the bird came from and the bird was in at and how he was being cared for Some times things happen and sadly there was not much we could have done to save our little friendMy son decided he wanted to try again and Birdz and Beyond just happened to have 8 week old hand trained cockatiels in stock so off we wentThe owner was amazing he took all the time in the world helping my son pick his new friend explaining care and picking out all of the new equipment we would need (Didn't want to take chances with the old cage etc) He was able to tell him the birds birthday as well which is important to my sonThey decorated his new cage together and my son was so excited to bring his new friend homeI will go back here for supplies grooming of the bird and they also do boarding if you need to be away from your friendHe spent most of the evening last night cuddling with his little friend and making sure he was all tucked in and ready for bed I am going to be a regular at this place with absolutely no doubt I may even buy a bird for myselfIf you have any bird needs or you are looking to get a new little friend go here I cannot rave enough.

1472,0,I would be giving this place no stars if I could I thought taking my car to a dealer would result in the highest quality work I was so wrong First their customer service is terrible I had to follow up over and over again over the 10 weeks that I dealt with them There were multiple instances of not getting called back not getting return emails not getting documentation emailed to me like I askedI could go on and on They did a very large amount of body work After having my vehicle for 35 weeks I finally got a call to pick it up About an hour after that call I received another call telling me they had failed to properly check the washer reservoir (which was damaged in the accident) and never replaced it I had to make another appointment to take the car in to have the reservoir installed (which they never called to tell me the part was in and again I had I follow up myself) When I took the car in the second time I repeatedly told them I was not happy with the way the good was fitting and asked at least 3 people to make sure they looked at the hood Upon picking it up the next day it came to find they never looked at the hood Too upset to even bring to their attention at that time I called and spoke to a manager the next week After taking the car in a third time it is finally fixed fairly well (they nicked the hood re-installing it which I will be calling about today) But even dealing with the manager I didn't get called about my vehicle for 5 days I guess that is what I get for dealing with a multi-billion dollar company that doesn't care about losing one customer Don't take your vehicle here It will only be a headache for you.
2236,1,We had the house pizza well done minus the green peppers It was awesome The beer list was great but the best part of the dinner was the bartender Danielle was so nice to us and was really fun to talk with She made the experience truly memorable We'll come back not just for the pizza but to hang with Daniel again too.
4412,0,This review is for the Clinique Make up counter in the Dillards store I have traveled and dealt with many Dillards and Macys make up and perfume counters I usually get excellent service and they even remember me because I return every year When I went to the Clinique counter this past month the counter manager was very unprofessional and rude She reprimanded a Clinique saleswoman (that was actually doing an excellent job with me) and made her feel like crawling in a hole for doing nothing wrong then she made up some excuse to help me instead of the sales associate that had been helping me Now -  I was in sales and I know how hard it is and how time consuming it is to make a good sale and then this manager just came over and took me away and kept the sale I was going to go the the head manager of Dillards and complain but at that time I had to just leave The woman that originally waited on me had my name even in her files and the manager still took the sale sorry but that's just wrong I will not go back.
3615,0,"We discovered ""Blu Burger"" because my son's soccer team was having a fundraiser there We went with my parents-in-lawIt was horrible First my son asked for a glass of water and the waiter said ""Wait a sec I need to go get these people""  and he ran to a different table when we weren't done ordering Then we confront the manager and he says ""Well it's busy"" and walks off Next to the food Half of our orders came wrong and we had to be charged for their mistake The burgers were cold and tasted like frozen patties Not going there EVER."
2096,0,"Awful food and service Went for breakfast Food was cold And bland Then they charged me for someone else's food and blamed it on their ""system"" instead of their incompetent staff The manager (Lisa) was completely unhelpful and never even apologized for their screwup I wish I could give it less than one starIn sum pretentious overpriced restaurant thinks they're better than you Skip it."
2108,0,"Small burger Small fry Small drink = $10Burger -- Tomato and Lettuce were fresh and good  Bun ""collapsed"" and became that gooey fake white bread bun that you can see where your hand grabbed the burger  The patty/cheese was fine I guessbut I didn't get any real flavor from itFries -- They use ""real"" potatoes but the fries are flavorless  But at least they're greasySoda -- Kudos for a good selection including two diet-caffeine-free choices something I've never seen beforeI'm not a fanboy of In-n-Out but at least they know to charge a reasonable price for their food (which is much better than Five Guys)In summarythis place is the emperor with no clothes  And they want you to know that lots of newspapers around the country think they're greatthe reviews are all over the walls  Perhaps they're trying to convince patrons that their tastebuds and pocketbook are lying."
826,1,This is a fun little place with an amazingly diverse menu and out-of-this-world food The beer list has everything from $2 Mickey's to gourmet brews The menu offers small light salad for me and grilled steak-filled sandwiches for my husband It has a fun and easy atmosphere with incredibly nice staff I have only been here a few times but it is becoming a new favorite.
4025,0,"No parking  Unfriendly staff except bartender  He was trying but quite marginalOMG  1 HOUR AND 35 MINUTES OF WAITING AND $120 BAR TAB REALLY  Not our first time gave this place chances after chances before writing it off  The hostess kept telling us 20 minutes after 20 minutes went by another 15-20 minutes etc  We saw people that just walked in get seated before us  Wasn't greeted when we entered not even a ""Hi can I help you""Wait area outside or in the bar area  My car is bigger than the bar /waiting area  I don't have a big carThe bartender was the only person in the place that we considered the most friendlyWell the mango margarita at $12 was okay Our meal tab was also over $120  for one salad one appetizer 1 sandwich 1 mixed seafood dinner and the slow cooked pork dinner  2 beers  AND was almost charged for 2 extra beers we had ordered but never got  So check your checksNo one smiles in the place which is filled with beautiful artwork that's for sale  The music is blaring so everyone has to shout to talk to each other  Good thing my husband and our male friend have loud voicesThe female waitress again seemed like she was having a bad dayor life Had no interest in our opinions about the food plates were plopped down on the tables she came to check on us twice 2nd time the guys asked for 2 more beers which never came The whole experience started at 6:30pm and ended at 10 Service and the meals didn't match the prices Ouch  A hole in a wall place that leaves a hole in your pocket."
1606,1,Myself daughter & husband (when not working) go every other Friday no matter what  The place is spotless  Amy Ken and all the employees always treat us like family and call us by our first names Selection of polish is fantastic just when we think we have tried every color polish new ones appear If you have had a bad experiences or never had your nails or toes done treat yourself and you will become a regular just like us  Ken's is the Nordstrom's of the nail industry  Ken and Amy you are the best that is why you have the best employees.
2766,1,My son and grandson tried out the wave pool recently and loved it It was indoors so no sunburn to worry about and had lifeguards standing guard all around They enjoyed the waves and waterslide both As an added bonus my very active 8 year old grandson (who was staying with us) was a tired out boy by the end of his swimming time :) A must visit for anyone wishing to wave swim without sitting in the beating sun Oh and the kids come home tired - yea.
4483,0,I don't know what is going on with this location but it is bad Very dirty stacks of dirty dishes piled up in the middle of the dinning room My pasta came burnt (crispy noodles) yuck We went for lunch and there was only a few people there Makes me wonder where all the dirty dishes came from and how long they had been sitting there Skip this place for sure.

2069,1,I am a fan of Top Shelf Mexican Food because of the chips and salsa and for their rendition of my all-time favorite food: a bean burro enchilada style The taste is awesome to me The waiter Nate/Nathan was very friendly He had the orders memorized for some of the patrons The burro is $495 with enchilada sauce (I like the red sauce) The drinks root beer etc are $250 and they have free refills My total was $812 for these two items I would eat there five days a week if my budget allowed it.
411,1,Sex In The City meets World of WarcraftThis dark sexy place is unlike most establishments you might find in the Scottsdale area which I not only appreciate but encourage It's a bit off the beaten path as the entrance is in the back and when you walk in your pupils will needs time to adjust in order to navigateThe wine selection was impressive and the hummus plate was perfect The staff was great When my best friend realized she really wasn't a fan of the wine we chose she was able to trade out for a different one with no difficulty or attitude whatsoeverThe DJ was spinning very relax-esque music with a little bit of funk It was a nice change of pace from the typical top 40 you'd hear elsewhere As the night progressed the beats got sexier and the songs more clever I was completely sold when he remixed Johnny Cash & some dub step Of course we didn't come out of there completely unscathed We had to visually endure a cougar (or two) throwing themselves all over their sugar daddies in a blatant gold-digging escapade for all to see But I guess that's the price you pay to party in ScottsdaleIt's a great bar and I would recommend it to anyone.
1168,1,Love this place I think this is probably the best Chinese buffet out here They serve quality gourmet food And they have a full bar too Place is clean and service is great Would go back anytime.
1001,1,From the wine to the service to food this place is OG Italian If you are ready for some carb-loading this is the place.
2051,0,I'm a regular customer of Fair Trade and I usually have nothing but good to say about it Just ten minutes ago though I stood at te counter for about five minutes watching one employee talk on her phone When the second employee came out from the kitchen she returned to a plate of food I have no idea what impression they think that produces in customers but I left without being served and I wonder if I should ever return I have no interest in patronizing a coffee shop that doesn't have a sense of customer service I will think very hard about going back which is too bad considering the many days I've spent there.
1731,1,"For a nice relaxing hike not too far from Phoenix the White Tank Mountains are a great place for it I've hiked the Waterfall Trail twice -- the first time in early spring when the waterfall was dry and the second time today early winter after a week of rain  This time there was a nice amount of water trickling down the rocks Not a gushing waterfall but as good as one can get in Phoenix The rock formations around the waterfall are amazing and a bit awe inspiring to think about how long it took for the elements to create such magnificent crevices out of the tough granite stoneThere are quite a few trails in the park area but I thoroughly enjoyed the Waterfall Trail It is a pretty short trail -- maybe about a mile or so -- well-paved with little ""real"" hiking involved There are informational placards along the trail that explain the history of the area and the different fauna and animals inhabiting the area It is a great opportunity to see tons of Saguaros Cholla and Barrel Cactus  And beside the awesome waterfall there are some fantastic petroglyphs carved on the many rocks along the trailFor some great scenery and a little history I'd highly recommend taking a few hours to walk/hike/jog the trail It's kid and dog friendly and well worth it in the end -- especially if you get to see a real live waterfall in the midst of a desert."
650,1,Visited Vincent's today with a local resident Ate breakfast out on the patio It was delightful They were willing to make an omelet for me that wasn't on the menu Very impressive and I would go back Service was outstanding.
2257,1,Love this place  It's definitely not fine dining  it's just a mom 'n pop that serves great food  Best part of the decor is the framed pictures of scenes in Greece  But the food  Fresh great quality ingredients great sized portions reasonable prices  I'm originally from Chicago and I think the owners are too  going to George's reminds me of being back home  Great gyros served with a yummy and substantial Greek salad is my fave.
3044,1,One of the most reasonable clubs we've been to in Phoenix in terms of pricing  But if it's truly a good club that isn't as big a factor  We got there waaaaay early (right after dinner) but that allowed us to sit and have a wonderful conversation  The club began to pick up around 10 and was pretty full by 11  The music was very dancable the service was timely  Highly recommend it.
3711,0,This was just awful We were seated inside a nearly empty dining room for breakfast The waitress eventually came around and brought our drinks Coffee and a fork to stir for me We placed our food order Then waited And waited Finished our drinks No refills When the food finally arrived I figured out why it took so long:  they were blackening the bacon Yep they served us totally black bacon  Yuck  No apologies for the wait or anything My son was still hungry after his kids pancake (He wouldn't eat the bacon) So we bought him a pastry in the gift shop after our $50 family breakfast Will not return.
2221,1,It's true After several failed attempts to eat at Butterfield's due to the long wait time I can finally say that I've finally had the chance to actually eat here So what did I think It was most definitely worth the wait There's a reason Butterfield's has a two hour wait on the weekends It's because this isn't your average breakfast They don't just have basic omelets and pancakes on the menu No they have succulent skillets filled with cheese hashbrowns eggs and toppings galore They have buttermilk pancakes with different flavors such as Oreo cookie pancakes They have bacon Belgian waffles They have oven baked pancakes The menu is large and in charge and this breakfast definitely leaves you full for the rest of the day During my first official visit here I ate my heart out I ordered the Santa Fe Scrambler which comes with eggs (I opted for egg whites) Chorizo sausage red jalapeño pepper onion & cheddar cheese All this sits atop freshly made crispy hashbrowns As if that's not enough the scrambler comes with your choice of pancakes or toast Of course I ordered the homemade buttermilk pancakes The feast arrived relatively quickly and it was absolutely a feast There was no way I could finish the meal but every bite I took was better then the next The hashbrowns were the perfect amount of crispy and the Chorizo had a nice kick to it The avocado and peppers blended in quite nicely and there was plenty of cheese to go around I doused my buttermilk pancakes with Butterfield's homemade syrup and wow they know how to make a carbtastic pancake I wish I could have consumed every last bite but I ate until I was full and left happily fullI'm so happy that I've finally had the chance to eat at Butterfield's Now that I know how delicious the food is the wait time won't seem so bad anymore.
3455,0,"Worst sushi I've ever had I guess you get what you pay for but I thought that since it was the ""oldest Japanese restaurant in Phoenix"" that it might be good The staff messed up our order and then when we got the missing roll argued about it's quality (poor) I will never go here again."
4318,0,The Food Truck Festival was awful I wish got my time and money back  I should up around 6:00 pm and the parking lot was packed I broke my leg 8 weeks ago and it was hard for me to maneuver through all the rock and plug in wires In two hours I was only able to three trucks beetit torched goddess and a barbecue truck The creme brûlée was amazing but I would rather deal with the crazy people scavenging for samples at Costco We left earlier than we expected since most of the lines were fifty deep and headed to Postinos and had an amazing dinner I rather go check out the good trucks in a different setting Good Concept though.
3302,0,I am disappointed that they are closed without any signs on the door or message on their voicemail I loved Picazzo's in Sedona and was excited about one opening here in Phoenix so I planned an office lunch party for the holiday and was shocked when we went there and saw the lights out and doors locked Not a good way to keep customers no matter how good the food is.
2980,1,Crackers & Co Cafe is as good as it gets for breakfast and lunch We go as often as we can and we have been eating here since this location opened about 4 years ago (and eating at the other locations for at least the past 20 years) My husband always has has all-time favorite baked potato soup with all the fixings and Bird to the Wise -- a turkey and bacon sandwich on a really yummy croissant I'm more adventurous and have probably had everything on the menu except for eggs Benedict - only because I don't like hollandaise sauce I can honestly say that I have never had anything that I didn't like here at C&C All the sandwiches come with homemade soups and the salads are to-die-for and huge Once in a while the soups have been a little inconsistent but if you tell them about it they fix it You can't beat a restaurant that is always willing to fix whatever they can fix I haven't noticed any inconsistencies in at least the past year My daughter eats from the kids' menu Of course she always wants the chocolate chip or Mickey Mouse pancakes which she adores but I usually try to talk her into some scrambled eggs for protein instead of having a carb-filled meal She has loved everything she's ever had from the kids menu She is a picky eater so this says a lotWe have had many of their desserts -- and they are yummy Their signature dessert is the Brandied-Cinnamon Bread Pudding It's devine It's so hard not to order a homemade dessert here And usually when we bring guests we always splurge and get some kind of dessertLike I said above C&C is as good as it gets for food service and ambiance.
982,1,"Wow  This place was delicious the ambiance felt authentic and our waiter seemed to emanate ""The Heart of India"" that of which I have often heardMy wife and I were in search of food on a late Monday night and we found Indian Paradise on Yelp  We ordered the Chicken Madras Palak Paneer and Garlic Naan and I liked it so much I found myself eating too quickly and wishing I could fit more in my stomachThe naan was among the best I've had and the ingredients in the Chicken Madras were savory and delicious  My wife who spent months in India said she was immediately harkened backOverall I love Indian food and I loved Indian Paradise  I humbly offer my 5 stars in thanks for their sumptuous meal."

1198,1,This is the mother of all Whole Foods- at least of the ones I've been too I understand that this location is fairly new and it shows in all of it's glorious aesthetically pleasing amazingnessThey have your WF standards-beautiful produce selection with a setup that makes you want to buy vegetables and fruits you don't even know how to cook and/or eat It has your salad bar olive bar deli mini pizzeria cheese shop smoothie bar-the gang's all here What makes it stand out is the actual bar inside of the market I know back up There's a bar in this WF Drinks snacks and if I'm not mistaken a nice view of the parking lot which is entertainment in itself because this WF shares a lot with Trader Joe's Nothing like the hordes of gluten-free vegan masses descending on the traditionally small lots of both stores and clashing like the Greek gods they think they are Instead of tritons and thunderbolts they use Priuses and recyclable bags full of tempehAnyway minus the sh-tshow parking lot this is a fantastic Whole Foods that I'm excited to go back to.
4855,0,I really wanted to like this place since my first experience at Centurion was so good Unfortunately after two attempts here I've given up The first attempt at eating at the bar came last Sunday We stopped in around 1 pm looking for a sandwich After being seated they inform us that only the brunch menu is available OK but by brunch menu they mean breakfast There are no typical lunch items available No problem so we place our order for the Wisconsin scones A few minutes later the waiter returned to inform us that they're out of hamburger meat At this point nothing else on the menu looks appetizing so we leave  I think no big deal this happens now and againWe decide to return the following Saturday and meet a friend for brunch This time full well knowing that means breakfast only We sit down and all order a bloody mary As the waitress is walking away she turns around to inform is that they are out of scones Out of scones That removes 1/3 of their menu I'm in disbelief that this happened again but really wanting to like this place we just decide to look for other options on the menu Then the waitress returns again and informs us that they're out of bloody mary mix  That was it for us As much as I wanted like this place that kind of management is inexcusable  I hope they can get it together but I don't plan on going back again just to be burned  Too bad because that Wisconsin Scone sounds amazing If they ever had all the ingredients there at the same time.
1816,1,I just don't understand how this place would get anything less of 5 stars After reading some of the reviews on here I am so disappointed at what the main complaints are I guess some people are used to going to an over the top sushi place in Scottsdale where you get your ass wiped for you I mean seriously get over yourselves people Kabuki is THE BEST I love the veggie roll there the avocado and pretty much anything vegetable My boyfriends favorite is the Alaskan Dynamite Philadelphia and sushi tempura I have tried other sushi places (Stingray Sushi Brokers etc) and I can honestly say that nothing compares Friday night and Saturday nights yes it gets busy yes you may have to wait get over it If it's busy and it takes a few minutes for your alcoholic drink to arrive so be it it's JUST a drink I love coming to Kabuki I love that they offer the Red Mask Club so you can get coupons in the mail and over all I love the Reverse Happy Hour Buy one get one for a dollar Yes please :).
2466,1,I absolutely love this place The fact it's only a couple miles from my house is an added bonus It's authentic northeastern Thai food It's very good I've backpacked through the region and know the cuisine obviously not as much as someone who's lived there for years as an ex-pat or a resident but I feel I got a grasp of the cuisine in the month I lived there This place is phenomenal It's the best Thai food I've had in the valley Obviously it's not your typical Thai food restaurant due to it being NE Thai but don't let that turn you away Don't let any of the bad reviews turn you away I've been blown away by the food Their salads are all phenomenal There is one with lettuce glass noodles bean sprouts pork and shrimp (forgot the name) and that's my favorite If you're not into spicy order at a 1 or 2 spicy and they'll bring out the chili spice for you to put on yourself I've ordered it a 3 spicy and it's almost too much for me to handle and I LOVE spicy food and especially Thai spicy They serve a pitcher of water at every table Their larb salad is also to-die-for They serve traditional Thai soups like shrimp and rice chicken and riceetc They're so good and a meal in and of themselves.
421,1,This is a great store and has been there for as long as i can remember  Yet it still always looks clean and fresh  The selection of products is off the Hook as they say   (They) the young generation   They absolutely have everything that you could imagine       Of course there is a drawback   The Price i t is very high priced shopping  but well worth it in a lot of ways Lots of parking and very friendly service AAt.

3908,0,That awkward moment when you realise that you get what you pay for I actually use to really like this place Great happy hour Good flavors on the wings I guess the awkward part of it all is that I'm not 23 anymore and my expectations are higher than they use to be Like tonight for example I placed an easy order of happy hour wings and a brew Well no I got a full order When I informed the server ( young red head with tats behind her ears and plugs) that I only ordered a small order of wings she offered to get me a box I figured this was so she didn't have to get management involved with the switch or what not despite my eager suggestion Needless to say the evening continued I eat one wing literally one A cockroach walks onto the bar It was small and may have been a beetle but still ew  There goes my appetite  Words of advice  If you do decide to come to good ol' Unc' Sam's wear protection Serves with mediocre at best The gals working there are 12 so I don't expect much I suppose However  the Peoria location is much better and cleaner ( it seems like) I'm only giving two stars because of the cheap beer and the decent wings Not good Just decent I think the beer helps Long story short If you have a party and want cheap cheapness well then you've found omg an other cockroach just walked up on the bar Are you absolutely kidding me Im seriously about to freak out and walk out I don't care if I haven't paid This is embarrassing DO NOT  EAT HERE.
2312,0,Sorry DOG This used to be the spot for a great Chicago dog or a slider or an Italian beef or sausage Back when Louie and Eddie a couple a wise guys from Chicago actually owned the joint The new owner is a tool It reflects in the crappy food This jag off is a whiner too I'd like to smack him in the head with the soggy ass chi dog he served up You can't skimp on the poppy bun either This stugots is screwing up a good thingLike I said before selling the recipes to a new owner isn't always going to be a good thing Here it is not RUN FORREST RUN Nothing to eat here.
1859,1,This place is amazing  We eat there once a week and more often than not are accompanied by family and friends  The food is incredible very fresh creative and tasty  Whatever the special is order it  It's always good and I have found myself requesting a former item that was on special even though it is not on the menu  That's the other wonderful thing about SakeBombers: the service  The staff is wonderful  They have never steered me wrong with a recommendation and do not hesitate to accommodate any special requests that we have made   Yoshi server/bartender is always very friendly and welcoming  Their happy hour is amazing - $150 for delicious miso soup  SakeBombers blows other sushi out of the water.
3184,0,While the ice cream looked delicious - there was no frozen yogurt  I was led astray  But this place sure is popular - the line was out the door  I am on a quest for a local yogurt joint - not sure why Yelp lists this as both a yogurt & ice cream shop.
3000,1,I was in Bomberos for breakfast this morning and I was told they now carry Coca Lite  So much better than Diet Coke - I had no idea I could find it anywhere in the US  How great is thatAlso Bomberos is now using MJ Breads and Tammie Co pastries not too shabby huh.
4018,0,The beauty of Chicago is the huge selection of ethnic foods we get to sample  So I was disappointed with the Greek selection Glendale has to offerFalafel had a weird grimy taste to it  Texture wasn't all there  Gyros were dry  Yogurt sauce accompanying it blandThey tried they failedMISERABLY.
224,1,We bought our blinds from Nu Vue when we moved into our new place They have a great selection and provided great service We are very happy with our blinds We were also very pleased with the timing and the cost We would definitely recommend Nu Vue to anyone in the valley looking for blinds or shutters.
257,0,Had Red Lobster tonight for dinner Not such a good idea I got the Rock Lobster tail that came to me partially raw (the entire bottom of the tail) I sent it back When I received the new one it was so overcooked and rubbery that I could have bounced it off of the floor and then it would have landed back on my plate Staff was very nice about it and was kind enough to remove it from our check Probably a good thing since I wasn't going to pay for it anyway.
4242,0,My husband and I live nearby so we decided to give it a try even though we think the best Thai in the valley is in downtown Phoenix at the wild Thaiger where we eat weekly We ordered a curry dish a noodle dish and the Tom ka soup All had a flavor that neither of us cared forvery bitter and rancid tasting The beef in the curry had lots of fatty gristle on it and the Tom ka was severely lacking in coconut milk I only had a bite of everything and then opted for a Wendy's hamburgerThat's  how unimpressed I was This place may be close to home but you can bet I won't be returning Steer clear of this one.
4215,0,I feel bad about this but why I'm the one who spent Friday night throwing up  I walked in to pick up my to-go order of Red Curry Chicken with brown rice only to find a woman ordering the very same thing  She enthusiastically praised the red curry and said that I would love it  After that and the mostly good reviews on Yelp I thought I was in for a treat  The funny thing is it was really good  I thought that I found a great little gem  The curry had tons of veggies and they even had brown rice I was pleased as punch  Skip forward to the next morning and I was feeling nauseous by the afternoon I was in flat out pain and well I won't tell you the rest  I can only equate it to that meal all I had before it was fruit and a piece of toast for breakfast and a Lean Cuisine for lunch  I started feeling slightly ill that night after my dinner from La's and it progressed steadily from thereI feel bad because the meal was good and obviously the lady who so enthusiastically recommended the curry hadn't experienced this before  I wish I could call her and ask her if she got sick too  Maybe this was a fluke but I'm sure as hell scared to try it again   So if you wanna know if the curry was good- yes it was  I would have given it 4 maybe even 5 stars unfortunately ruining my weekend brings it down to 1 star  I feel compelled to say that the place seemed clean and the employee who helped me was nice I am sad that I won't be going back  Just don't say I didn't warn you  Maybe just stay away from the curry.
2099,1,Want to get a party poppin' With over 30 flavors to select from one can find a flavor for any occasion  I've been in there a little bit too much getting snacks for the office as well as snacks for clients/meetings  A mini is a great size to try out different flavors  From savory selections like Beer Cheddar Sour Cream and Chives fruity flavors Strawberry or Pineapple to sweet blends Kettle corn and Butterfinger  Love the Puppy Chow mixture of popcorn chex mix and pretzel sticks in sweetness  Can't decide Try the Scottsdale blendWhite Cheddar and Carmel YUMMY  Hidden inside the strip mall totally worth checking out.
168,1,I LOOOOOOOOOVE GREEN I don't love their parking Beware Carpool if you can DON'T PARK AT COCO'S They sometimes tow That being said their food is DELICIOUS Proof that vegetarian and vegan doesn't mean tasteless Definitely get the fries they're seasoned and pretty much perfect You get a decent serving of them as well Brunch is served on Sundays I've never been disappointed The Biscuits'n'gravy is quite tasty.
3415,0,Not great at all  If I could give this place a zero I would  I ordered one thing and was given another and not even asked if they could replace with what I ordered when I took it back  The chips are not even chips they are like cinnamon pita chips  I would not recommend this place at all.
1104,1,The House is just how it sounds It is amazing that Matt Carter(Zinc Bistro and Mission) continues to evolve So comforting and service was amazinng especially considering it has only been open a few weeks King crab and smoked gouda fondue Roasted Halibut and the Lamb Bolognese was suprisinglyreally good the lemon marscopone and mint worked fantastically Patio is amazing weather permitting.
3491,0,"Worst customer service experience ever My boyfriend bought a pair of rimless frames and was upsold on super pricey ""high index"" lenses that were supposed to be thinner than normal ones (They were virtually the same)They came in (after the first three pairs from the lab failed quality inspection) and we had to wait for an hour while they put in the extra set of lenses because the initial set had a bubble The second set they put in seemed ok till we were home and he noticed that there is a small watermark on the lenses visible in each eye's field of view AND the lenses weren't even cut to fit the frame correctly These are $600 glasses by the way just sayin' We spoke with a very unapologetic and defensive manager/supervisor Angel who was shaking because she was so angry (that she had to offer customer service to someone with legitimate concerns) said the markings are standard and they couldn't do a perfect cut with the frame he selected  I was very thrown off by her behavior since the customer in this situation was being really calm and friendly about the whole situation I've verified since then that these markings and off-cut are not standard at most quality retailers and I have a hard time believing it is for a trusted name brand like LensCraftersHe reordered the glasses with regular polycarbonate lenses so that he wouldn't have to deal with indicator markings They told him it would take up to two business weeks to fill the order After two weeks passed he called Angel said she would call him back and never did This happened twice and because he wasn't getting any return calls he finally decided just to go in to the store When he did they did in fact already have the glasses and he waited for her to prepare them -- not sure how long they were sitting in the storeIt ending up taking over a full month to get these glasses In the meantime the immature manager and the sales rep Marina that we worked with offered no apologies at all  Apparently once you've paid they don't want to deal with your issues I found the experience really disappointing because I've always had extremely positive dealings with LensCrafters in the past but we won't go to this  location again in the future."
2017,1,"Hamburger HeavenIf you have been searching for the ultimate char-grilled burger served with hand cut fries and kosher pickles THIS IS THE PLACE Not only does this 12 oz ""slice of heaven on a roll"" satisfy the most finicky of hamburger aficionados (like my boyfriend and I) they also have the most fabulous dinner menuThe atmosphere is rock solid contemporary comfort with hand signed guitars hanging at each booth The music AND the food is second to no otherthis is NOW our favorite place to ""rock out"" anytime we are craving a burger fix which is at least once a weekNOTE: my boyfriend claims that most reviews are not realso if anyone questions the validity of this review feel free to contact me as I assure you this hamburger is the real deal and I am NOT associated in any way with this restaurantDid I mention that WE LOVE THIS BURGER LOL."
1683,1,Have you ever experienced a visit to a restaurant that you wouldn't change in any way  Everything about Donovan's was outstanding - from the time we arrived to the time we left it was nonstop wonderful food ambiance and service  We enjoyed:Crab cake appetizer:  It was more like a crab continent - this thing was big   Big and full of crab meat goodness without any filler  Crab crab  and more crab  Spinach salad:  Light blend of spinach mushrooms bacon and a tangy dressing - a great transition into the main courseFilet with shrimp scampi:  My filet was prepared a perfect medium rare and the shrimp were graced with a light garlic sauce that still allowed the shrimp flavor to shine through  Entrees come with vegetables (snap peas and carrots - crunchy and flavorful) as well as a choice of potato  We both chose baked potatoes which were garnished with all the fixin's tableside  YumWine and water glasses never went empty - every need seemed to be anticipated before we could even ask  The team made us feel both appreciated and pampered  I wish more restaurants had this type of attention to detailMy only regret is we did not save valuable stomach real estate for dessert  Guess a return visit has to happen soon.
3454,0,My wife and I went to Havana Café on our 1st date  Needless to say we love the place and it means something special to us  We have been there many times  The past 3 visits have gone downhill quickly3 visits ago the Paella was mediocre at best  2 visits ago the service was poor  This last trip the service was horrid  The food was good   However we waited 20 minutes for our check  There were 6 of us and they added an automatic 20% gratuity  I understand that is the policy of most places  But when the service is plain and simply bad that is just not ok  To top it off at 6pm on a Saturday evening it wasn't just warm in the restaurant it was flat out HOT  I was sweating for the 2nd half of our dinner and throughout the time we waited to get our check  The service and temperature made for a very bad experience  I am very sad to say that we will not be back to Havana café.
360,1,very cool restaurantopen kitchen great service great staffmy only complaint here are the portions  don't go here if you are hungry - this place is more about presentation  very good but very smallThis placed was packed on a random weeknight so make sure to call ahead for rezzies.
127,1,Flemings must have the best service in this town We came in early for HH Kris bounded over with a huge welcoming smile to get us seated and comfortable on the spacious patio Next he introduced us to our waiter Doug Ray Even though it started to get busy he never forgot about us checking with us frequently to make sure all was going well What a gracious guy Then Prentice came to inquire if everything was AOK The food was awesome but one thingif you want onion rings on the burger you have to ask now Come on over You won't regret it.
3086,0,I try to not give out 2's and 1's for ratings but I really can't stand Pappa Johns  Do yourself a favor and pay a few bucks more for some good pizza  If you insist on greasy chain pizza Hungry Howies is the only choice.
643,1,We were on our way to lunch to another restaurant when we noticed the banner about TM My husband could eat mexican food seven days a week so we decided to give it a try  They opened at the beginning of November so they still have Alex Padilla as their Executive Chef  We were so happy we had the opportunity to meet him and talk to him for a few minutes  This place has been completely remodeled I didn't even realize until a few minutes later that this is where Roy's used to be  I loved the decor simple classy  The decorative doors are really cool  We started with a couple of margaritas  My husband had the Taberna and I had the classic  They were both excellent  I was not very hungry so I decided to have the Jicama salad  It was not only beautiful but also delicious and refreshing  Loved the texture combination  My husband had the tortilla soup and the beef tacos  I am not a soup person but I found myself going back to my husbands soup 4 or 5 times more  Every bite was a little different one time some corn another the melted cheese at the bottom  The presentation is really beautiful a miniature cast iron pot with the lid to the side very clever  The soup is not the broth base type maybe that is why I liked it  I only eat chicken soup when I am sick  This is more of a tomato base and creamier  The beef tacos are made with filet mignon I took a bite and it was delicious  I thought I was going to be good today but then we had a couple of desserts in front of us  I couldn't resist I loooooove Tres Leches cake so when I saw it in front of me I was in love  It was perfect the texture the milky/condensed milk oozing from the soft spongy cake  I had more than what I should have  I will have to go on the treadmill a couple of extra hours this week  I also had the flan this is the Mexico City style with cream cheese which makes it a little denser  It was truly delicious but I am still partial to Tres Leches I think this might be the best one I have had in the past six years  I'll post some pictures of the dishes we had soon  they were too pretty not to picture themI am so happy this place is in Scottsdale  I love Phoenix and its cuisine however I have too many friends who are not adventurous enough to stray away from their area  I will definitely come back sometime soon and enjoy a drink by the fireplace  Really cool place.

3373,0,Ordered 2 pizzas The good news had a groupon The bad news the pizza Both pizzas needed a spatula to pick up a slice without it slopping all over the place All the ingredients on the pizza plate before you can eat it The weakest thin pizza I've ever had If they offered a free pizza I would decline it.
4920,0,Was here yesterday and the girl running the registered rushed us saying that the cash register was timing her and that we had to hurry up and put everything on the counter Dont understand why she couldnt start ringing up the things we had up there First time i have ever been so rudely rushed to be checked out of a store Absolutely no customer service.
3542,0,Dropped my daughter off at her in laws house in South Phoenix and my son and I had some time to kill before we had to pick her back up and I wasn't into driving back into Chandler I asked my son if he wanted to go visit our old Applebee's  We use to live in South Phoenix for 8 years and Applebee's on 24th st & Baseline became like a family/friend hang out for usSo off we went it was 7pm on St Patty's Day but only had a 15 min wait which we thought was pretty cool  When we got to our booth we talked about the times we had been there  and how one time my son was just being a jerk and the rest of us were starving and he only ordered celery it was fun talking about the old memoriesWe went with the 2 for 20 deal and the food tasted great our service was friendly and fast it was the end of the meal and we just paid and then my son looked down on the floor and just said oh my I looked at him because he doesn't say that that much and I said whats going on  he said mom just move fast and lets leave a mouse just ran by our feetI said WHAT He said yes it was this big showing me with his hands and said just move carefully and lets go let me tell you I wanted to puke my dinner up right thenbut I didn't I left the tip because she was good and we leftYes I did tell Patrick the Kitchen Manger that my son had saw a mouse he told me that they come from across the street and that he will notify his pest control guyBUT OMG I hate mice I will not be coming back I know it happens more often than I would like to know about this was a place that held some fun memories for us but I am not looking to go back any time soon.
4502,0,"Golden Spoon has an amazing product It's truly the ice cream lover's froyo The yogurt is creamy flavorful and relatively nutritious The staff are also consistently friendly and helpful Why the one star rating  On a mission to satiate my cinnamon yogurt craving last weekend I stopped by the Shea location Some yogurt melted on my fingers while sampling--no biggie I'd just run to the restroom While drying my hands I glimpsed some movement out of the corner of my eye so I took a closer look  I'd like to refrain from naming the baby bugs I saw darting around I think we all know what bug is associated with perpetual infestation  No I'm not referring to termites or ants Heart rate elevated I took a brisk walk out to the front of the store Passing the garbage can directly adjacent to the yogurt machines I spotted the one of the adult culprit(s) just chilling out and enjoying life I absorbed my surroundings:  the yogurt machines were covered in what looked like several days' worth of melted froyo the floor was in dire need of a proper cleaning and the front doors were propped open There's nothing like the smell of delicious sugary froyo wafting out the door to invite some more ""friends"" into the place I immediately emailed the owner of this location but I have yet to hear from him/her I can't believe I actually went though with that purchase My stomach lurches every time I think about having a taste After this experience I will never go back Ever."
4374,0,we had a 7:45 reservation last night and were not seated til almost one hour late During this time we were given no updates on when we might be seated  It was suggested that we go to the bar but it was 10 deep and looked like the bar  scene in Star Wars so that was not an option  It is unconscionable for a restaurant as expensive as yours to treat your guests like cattle Our waiter was efficient enough but not professional and thought his job was to entertain us like Henny YoungmenWe also noted that the portions of food have been made significantly smaller ie(the swordfish) with no reduction in price.
3676,0,I wish I remembered her name she was blonde thin and had a deeper voice she took my name and then sat down at her station to talk to her friend Maybe she was on break There was only one other stylist working 15 min later she seats me and brushes my hair and snags my earring with her comb THEN she asks me to take them off She could have told me before she hurt me She does a few snips and begins to talk with her friend that was sitting in the chair next to me and again practically ignored me  Second time here and I should've stuck with my initial gut feeling Never again.
1451,1,Bartenders Bob & Brian hands down is the best bar tenders in Phoenix Great happy hour prices and free pupu's on friday's.
4775,0,My friend and I went late Saturday morning for omelets Mine was a huge disappointment It was obvious that it had been sitting under a heat lamp They tossed in chopped bacon folded heated and served It was more of a very dry egg taco My friend said his omelet was okay I will say that the coffee was good and the server was friendly It wasn't worth the 20 minute wait outside in the heat we won't be returning.
773,1,I've found a new grocery shopping destinationand I think I may be in love Sure I don't know what half of the items on the shelves are used for and I don't really care for dates but there is just so much goodness in between the mystery items that it doesn't matter I'm hooked The produce is cheap and much better than the comparably cheap Ranch market nearby and you just can't beat a package of freshly made pita for fifty cents The spice array is dizzying and I really want to find out what one does with Pomegranate syrup  One distinct advantage Baiz has over other markets is the meat counter Where else in town can you get fresh lamb and goat Baiz market is so great that it now has a place in regular rotation on our grocery outings As a bonus the Al-Hana restaurant inside is a great place to grab a cheap but excellent meal during the trip.
3895,0,"place is nice staff is stuck up and rude i really like this place its very upscale i don't know the person who did my nails cause she didn't tell me she forgot what services i wanted ""but theres a bar tab' doesn't make any sense i was supposed to get a hot stone massage and a sugar scrub but i guess she really didn't care on what i wanted this has to be the worst nail salon i been to ever  i mean paying ""50"" just for regular services i added two luxury services but oh well she where's glasses middle age woman i think it was very unprofessional e  and i will defiantly not go back."
3623,0,Very poor integrity in busines practices I moved to Tempe from another state to start school at ASU and had sent my application with fee--and was told I had an apartment waiting for my arrival in two days When I arrived the apartment had been rented to someone else and my application fee was not refunded No explanation or apology--and they had my contact information.
1028,1,The ambience is great Highly recommend the sopprassata sandwich and the Italian ices (especially the pear brandy).
3695,0,"A heaping scoop of cold mashed potatoes slathered with LAME sauce is how I would classify this dinnerI've read some of the other reviews on this particular establishment and will agree with the one that says that businesses sometimes have bad days  It would appear that this business is having more than their fair share these daysThere were 5 of us including one fairly easy to please 10 year old  First it took the server the better part of a half an hour to acknowledge that we were sitting on the patio in high 80 degree weather with no beverages IN THE DESERT  C'mon  Once we ordered I just assumed that everything would remedy itself  It was only the beginningWhen the food was delivered (along with the appetizer that we ordered) it was cold and not even close to what we ordered  Picture it a ""hot"" roast beef open faced sandwich which I asked for a substitution of french fries for the mashed potatoes (not a major request) and the bread was cold and soggy because it sat in the window forever  When I asked to have it made to it's menu specifications AKA HOT they took it back and threw it in the microwave and returned the plate to me as I sent it back to the kitchen  How do I know that  Well you know what happens when you put bread in the microwave  It's gets hard and stale a texture that once you experience you won't soon forgetWhen we told the waitress that ""tonight isn't a good night for us here I guess""  Her response was ""It is for me too""  Server Rule "

3797,0,"Really mediocre just plain jane boring sandwiches  They skimp on key ingredients like cream cheese on the lox sandwich on pumpernickel which btw the bread tastes stale and the worst pumpernickel I have ever had not fresh or nice tasting at all  Just really not a very good place and not very good sandwiches  The thing that really earks me and inspired me to write the review is their cocky name Sacks ""Art of Sandwicherie""  There is NO art going on here just plain boring commercialized sandwiches that sound good but disappoint  I will never be coming back there are much better alternatives  Basically anything other than subway will win this place out  What a disappointment."

4598,0,Not that great but it is between this place Wendy's and Starbucks in terminal 3 So if you want booze this is your only option Chips were stale and salsa had zero flavor and resembled ketchup Again this is the only show in town (aka terminal 3).
1283,1,They are great every bit of advice makes total sense and if you just take time to practice their simple techniques you and your dogs lives will be much easier and more fulfilling I have seen a huge shift in my dog's behavior since taking her to their basic manners class It is well worth the money.

1012,1,Maggie is always finding the best products to bring to her clients and is always going to seminars to continue learning  I've been extremely pleased with Maggie's facials and on-going skin care and products  My skin looks tighter smoother and fresher than before working with Maggie  Her prices seem fair and she goes above and beyond every time I see her.
4942,0,This place must have an insect infestation About a month ago my sister ordered take out and found a cricket in her almond chicken When she called and confronted them about the situation they showed no remorse or shock The next day she took the food back What is really disburing about this is that when I shared the story with my best friend she said she had a fly on her plate several years ago I will never eat here again.
1204,0,This place is terrible  I went with a co-worker because we had gotten coupons  We only work 5 minutes away in good traffic so we decided to order on line that way we didn't have to take an extended lunch break I noted on my order online that I had a coupon for free chips as did my co-worker  They called her to tell her that her order would be cancelled because they cannot do coupons online  This is not noted anywhere online  I was not called and was charged for everything  I didn't have the option to leave the chips on or take them off  There is absolutely no parking anywhere close to this establishment  We ended up parking down the street and walking 2 blocks to get there When we got there our sandwiches were ready right away which was great  The guy running the register forgot our drinks/chips and had to be reminded by someone else before we left  Their fountain drink area was dirty and had tea spilled all over the place  When I went to get a lid the entire lid holder fell over We were still willing to give the benefit of the doubt - until we took our first bite  This sandwich was one of the worst sandwiches I've ever had  I got the turkey sandwich and it tasted old and like tuna  I couldn't even stomach more than 2 bites  $10 thrown in the trash over this  I will never go back here.
136,1,There is no greater fast food restaurant than Chick Fil A As a guy who's eaten at a lot of fast food restaurants over the years I can say this without question I used to eat their scrumptious chicken nuggets at their old location at Metrocenter mall when I was little and I have had a love for their food ever since If you love chicken as much as I do you will be hard-pressed to find a better recipe They know how to prepare chicken better than anyone The use of peanut oil to fry their chicken makes it healthier and much less greasy than their competitors Throw in a fantastic mix of herbs and spices incredible waffle fries a wide variety of condiments and homemade lemonade and you have yourself the most fantastic meal you'll ever get at a fast food establishment Whether you go for one of their sandwiches the nuggets or the breakfast items the chicken is without equal LOVE LOVE LOVE this place.
3190,0,I cannot state strongly enough how disappointing the management services are at Amcor The particular community manager I have dealt with over the past year is both unfriendly & unprofessional His lack of attention to community concerns will leave your HOA vulnerable to insurance claims or law suits.
205,1,We go here for lunch every time we visit my Mom in Arizona  We always get the same thing because we love it so much  The Asparagus Soup to start and also a Cesar salad  Then we get the 4 cheese pizza and my mom makes her own combo pizza  It is so good  It is Italian pizza if you like that style  It is just hard to find it made like this anywhere  Can't say much about anything else there but if you go this route you will be very happy.
3176,0,"So this is gonna be one of 'those' reviews Yes Iam a hater Granted The Sandbar isn't a true Scottsdale club at least to me but what would I know I likes the dive bars So here's the story I have a habit of becoming good friends with people who like these places How this happens I don't know I guess Iam just that awesome Been dragged here twice Iam not gonna count the 3rd time because that was more of a 'walked in thru the kitchens back door to get to the restrooms' type of visit The other 2 times I went there were not planned but same basic experience each time The sandy beach out front is a hassle and I got tired of hearing those girls complaining about how difficult it is to walk thru duh its freakin' sand It took a while for the bartender to make the drinks since she was the only one in the outside area As for inside lots of MMA inspired shirts and camisoles with no bras AKA super classy I suppose I chose a bad night since whenever a UFC fight is on its super packed with big strong guys watching big strong guys fight on TV so my fault there In the end I was bored out of my mind but highly entertained with the group who was doing the ""Lean Like A Cholo"" dance while sitting in a booth So 1 star and that's being generous."
3566,0,The place is called DESERT PEAKS now I and 3 coworkers went yesterday for lunch Our company relocated our office off of McKellips We have been trying to look for a good lunch place DESERT PEAKS has now been crossed off our list We must have gotten the hemorrhoid waitress also She was not attentive to our needs at all She was more concerned on flirting for tips with her bar patrons It took 30 min for us to receive our food (there was only one other table for 2 seated) When she brought our food out to us she placed it in front of us and immediately turned and walked off She did not ask if everything looked ok or if she could bring us anything else I actually  did need sauce and cheese for my italian sausage sandwich and my friend needed ranch for her fries I sat without touching my meal hoping she would come and check on us The waitress never came back After 15 minutes my friend finally got her attention to come to the table I asked for my sauce & cheese and ranch She took my plate Then came back said she forgot what the other request was We told her ranch She brought back the ranch and my plate My fries were now cold One of my friends had pizza His dough was not baked in the middle It was very soggy and alot of grease was formed on the top from the pepperoni It was a HORRIBLE experience She was a crappy waitress and the food was less than average This is coming from someone that eats lunch out 5 times a week.
2670,1,"You know what  This has been such a great place to shop lately I think it's time to move them up to 5 Stars  Here's why:*  Amazing sale prices  EIGHT Avocados (not ONE) for $1  Excellent quality boneless skinless chicken breasts $169/lb and tasty free marinade to make them even better  Beef  Tender boneless Cross Rib Steaks or Roast $249 lb () & free marinade available for them too  Just ask at the big meat counter (which is another plus to this store)  Then there are the bananas 25¢ a pound and so on  Wow  So many great other specials too every week*  A good inexpensive restaurant inside  (See my review for Dos Ranchitos Cafe)*  Fast & friendly customer service*  Interesting Mexican style events held here often  Today for instance a guy out in the parking lot had a machine with a big wire drum & four big blow torches blasting flame into it ""air broiling"" hundreds (thousands) of Pablano chiles & oh what a great smell  (See photo)*  A real screwball mix of customers - great people watching while you enjoy your tasty lunch here""Woohoo""  for this bigbusy noisy fun supermarket     :-))."
3951,0,Took my dog here It was the only place that doesn't require proof of shots Pretty decent for my poor side I can't cut my dogs nails cause they are black and I clip them too close and make him bleed every time I try They gave him back to me and all seemed okay Got him in the truck and he starts bleeding everywhere Really I could have done that myself and save the gas and the cost of it I won't be going back here They get 1 star just because you don't need proof of shots to bring your animal there.
597,1,AMAZING The bread is fresh the sauces homemade and the meat is sliced for your orderWe came in for sandwiches only and left after dessert with a loaf of pumpernickel for the house My girlfriend fell in love with the Boston Cream cake and vows to try each of the dozen plus pastries they make The owners were really sweet and chatted us up while we ate No questions needed we will be back to this place SOON.
1084,1,This place only gets better - nice to have all the extra room since they expanded and it still maintains that funky urban vibe with interesting furniture - we sat on cardboard chairs - and the best Cappucinos in the Valley.
4213,0,This place is terrible  We should've known when we sat down and there was not 1 asian person in this place (including the workers)  One of the rolls we got was the lotus  It tasted dirty and like lighter fluid (it is served surrounded by a flame)  There were 3 of us in our party tonight and we all left feeling sick  Not only would I not go back to this place I would encourage all of my friends NOT to patronize this place.
1699,1,Being from Cali and had the oppertunity to watch movies at the premier sites Of course this place does'nt match up to them But for being a local theater that offers Tues and Thurs specials I have no problem with this place I usally come here during the week days late to watch a movie with the family to stay away from the kids who would rather talk then watch a movie The D box is ok to try once but I will not be using again.

4751,0,"US AIRWAYS - The WORST customer service  Have you also had a horrible experience with this airlineRecently my wife and I flew from Phoenix to Munich via Los Angeles The first leg was (unfortunately) on US Airways through the 'Star Alliance' which is a group of airlines that claim to work together to make the flying experience more enjoyable  We were scheduled to connect to our Lufthansa for the flight to Germanyleg in Los Angeles What we experienced was horrible customer service on US Airways leaving me to question what is the benefitof the Star AllianceThe details: The US Airways agent refused to check our bags from Phoenix to our final destination even though they are in the Star Alliance with Lufthansa which they claim makes it all one big happy family of airlines    When we asked why the US Airways agent wouldn't check our bags through as we had all our boarding passes and were checked in for all our flights he decided to (we find out later) lie and say that 5 days prior US Airways changed its policies to no longer allow luggage to be checked to a final destination if you are connecting as part of your trip It had never been this way based on the benefits of the Star Alliance and we make this trip every year so were very put off by his lack of help The result - my wife had to sprint and catch a shuttle in the very busy Los Angeles airport to get to the international terminal begging Lufthansa to wait for her sweating husband who had to wait (and wait) to pick up our bags in baggage claim and bring them to the Lufthansa ticket counter to be rechecked for the long flight Unfortunately the US Airways flight left Phoenix 1  1/2 hours late dwindling our connection time concerning us that our bags would not make it on the flight to MunichThankfully the ticket agent at the Lufthansa counter was amazing claiming it was not a problem to get our bags on the plane even with such a short amount of time before takeoff (he even had an additional agent waiting to take our bags if need be) but informed us that the US Airways ticket agent had told us wrong information  He said the ""new regulation"" the US Airways agent referred to does not exist especially since we had our boarding passes from Los Angeles to Munich already printed  Basically the US Airways agent had lied to us and refused to helpWhat matters here is that US Airways has a complete disregard for customer service has no issue taking money for an expensive ticket yet lacks any desire to deliver customer service or provide the services they claim they provide to their customers My wife and are were so frustrated and so put off by the lack of help to get us checked through to our final destination that I had to share this story  Don't believe everything you are told by these airlines and DEMAND better service    We will be looking for a different airline option next time we fly - choosing not to fly on US Airways based on this experience."
4131,0,The best part of the meal was our server she was friendly and attentive  The food was pathetic  Ordered potato skins and each one had a few crumbs of bacon and a pinch of cheese about the size of a quarter on each   My  friend ordered the spinach dip and it was good but I was still disappointed looking at my potato skins sitting there so lonely and nakedSat near the window big mistake it was so hot.

2467,1,"Well this place is a staple in my diet  while currently training for the ironman AZ it is critical to meet certain dietary restrictions   These consist of high carb high protein fiber and solid hydration  I have eaten at Saigon Nites more than 500 times and that is no exaggeration  Minh and his wife (the owners) treat you like family when you walk in  I live and die on their Chicken Pho soup and shrimp summer rolls like Eugene mentioned in the previous review  when you order the pho you can order it ""ZACK STYLE"" and they will know what you are talking about and probably give you a hug  Also ask to see pictures of Brandon and Brandelina two of the cutest little Vietnamese kids ever to set foot in North America :)  Back to the food for a second  The menu is very diverse offering fish chicken meat vegetarian and they can prepare it any style you wish  Light oil heavy sauce no sauce etc  Extremely accommodating  Also another disclaimer I have no vested interest in this restaurant solely a patron and advocate so they can expand their family business throughout the valley  On a off day I will order the vermicelli noodles with egg rolls and pork (not kosher) but don't tell my mom  I also ask for extra roughage  The portions are huge and you will leave more than satisfied  Back to the Pho preparation if you like hot and spicy you can doll this soup up so much you will need your own Kleenex  Their jalapenos are hotter than Heidi Klum and Angelina Jolie put together  I have seen bald men cry off their foreheads into the soup  Be careful with the jalapenos sirachi sauce and there are two other red hot sauces on the table proceed with caution  I have noticed 2 maybe 3 hair grow on my chest since my ingestion with the red smooth sauce in the glass container  This is only for grown men and women alike   My last suggestion is for the lemongrass chicken extra sauce  I prefer this over noodles versus the rice and has a potent sauce that is delicious  I am salivating now writing this review  As my office is across the street many times I dine alone  Next time you stop in there for lunch have a seat at my table and order it up Zack style and guaranteed you will leave happy and ""pho""  Zack."
2223,0,They now offer more things for me to try since my last visit  The hot salsa tasted like can  I could taste can  it was canned smooth tomato product that was slightly spiked with something spicy  I tried the pico and I am not sure if the chopped tomatoes were frozen because they looked like frozen and thawed  The tomatoes were also unripe and the seasoning was unpleasant to me  I will not fault them for the margarita since I didn't expect the best but the margarita tasted like dry mix As I mentioned in my last Yelp I didn't care for the seasoning of the chicken I had last time but I thought it was just me  I was afraid to order chicken again so I ordered a chili relleno  I took one bite and I didn't spit it out but I couldn't take a second bite either   I only tasted pan oil  My husband tried it and he said it was awful and he felt bad  and said to try his food  I tried a piece of beef from his platter and it was just dry and tasted like it was just plain dry beef just soaked in jalapeño brine  Maybe they are better at times and I was just unlucky with my visits I think it was one of the owners that asked me how everything was  I didn't have the balls to tell her  Would you.
1817,1,This is a great place if you love good beer  And life is too short to drink bad beer  They have a great selection of bottles that you can purchase and drink in the bar or take out in a mixed 6 pack  They also have a rotating menu of beer on draft   This is not a bud light drinker's bar They have great pizzas also.
672,1,Finally tried this place (I know I'm soooo out of the loop) and I was very impressed It's hard to find a great quaint little breakfast place that is actually accessible at all times (sorry Matt's) The décor is great This old Taco Bell has barely been converted at all save for a few walls knocked down to make a patio -- a very cool wood-encased little shell of a space The open-air roof keeps it breathable but you're cool as a cucumber The inside is diner supreme: bright colors comfy bar stools in a rub-your-elbows-sized room I think the prices are very decent and you get bigass portions I had the sirloin and eggs I was craving something hearty and I got it This is like half a cow chopped up into little bites three eggs however you like them carmelized onions cooked to perfect tenderness and diced jalapenos for some added kick It rocked my life And have you tried the Over Easy iced coffee Cold-brewed coffee (read: strong) over ice with sweetened condensed milk cardamom and cinnamon with mint leaves It's f'ing ecstasy Try it you'll love it.

810,1,1/22 and 1/23I ADORE The Kitchen  So much so I ended up visiting three times in one week :)  [Unfortunately I only have photos from the first two visits as I had misplaced my SD card after the third]  Wow where do I start  The front of the venue reminds me of an AJ's Fine Foods or a (very) mini-Whole Foods: there's the bread aisle to your right as you walk in cash registers to your left and straight ahead is the cold food section where you may find deli side items (along w/ roasted veggies and crisp asparagus spears) as well as prepared paninis which they'll grill for you if you want  Try the white cheddar w/ truffled butter on sourdough- to die for  I get it EVERY time no matter what else may strike my fancy during my stay here (and I'm here for HOURS no exaggeration)  Beside and behind this deli counter are cases of pastries and pies charcuterie products and cheese  There is also a soup kiosk as well as a sandwich station  There is a self-serve dining section in this room w/ a couch or two and coffee table as well as bar-height tables and chairs and a couple of electric sockets to plug into while you utilize free wi-fi  While the sandwich maker will happily oblige you in slicing a loaf of bread you picked up from the many shelves and even toast a few slices for you to have w/ the half-pound of Tuscan chicken salad you sampled first at the deli counter make no mistake in thinking you'll be able to flag someone down as you dine at the self-service area  Once you pay for your items you're on your ownIf it's effusive service you want head over to the back of the restaurant where you'll find a wine bar to your left a lovely dining area in the middle and a bar counter to the right  There's even patio dining in the back but it was too cold to even consider that option then  You'll find live music between 6p and 9p on Friday nights  The times I spent there the group Slave to the Groove played  One of the two musicians used to be a chef :)  In between the sections of self- and full-service you'll find a coffee bar featuring Portland Roasting Company coffee where you may also purchase pastries such as muffins cookies and scones and to its right you will find the pizza/hot grill station where pizzaiolos/cooks busily prepare your pizzas burgers sandwiches or even roast prime rib while you wait  (The lay-out of TK is to me nicely done  I wish my home could feel like this  Oh and did I mention there is free wi-fi  Not hard to imagine that I've spent hours here now is it)Before I go on and on let me just list a few items I really enjoyed: 1 White cheddar panini w/ truffled butter $4 (don't forget to have it pressed)  Perfect w/ that $5 glass of wine during happy hour2 Prosciutto goat cheese fig and arugula bruschetta w/ aged balsamic vinaigrette- a great deal on their happy hour menu3 Apple crumble w/ vanilla-bean ice creamps  Their caffe latte is superb  I have it w/out sugar so that I can justify splurging on a cookie (or two)- the white chocolate macadamia nut or the oatmeal-raisin pairs up well  (I'd pass on the chocolate chip cookie- the chips used aren't of great quality IMHO)   Whether you're here for lunch happy hour coffee break or dinner you'll find The Kitchen a worthwhile choice  (Did I mention they also serve breakfast  Menu looks divine I haven't been but if someone sets up a breakfast UYE here I'll try my best to attend).
3899,0,"Okay so at one point in time I would have been happy to say Garcia's was a good place to eat Not anymore It is probably the worst place ever Let me tell you of my experience and their horrible service at this placeWe were at Arizona Mills and were starving  We passed up Rainforest Café as the wait was long and Garcia's was no waiting  Now I know whyWe were seated almost immediately Now keep in mind I have eaten at Garcia's in the past (years ago) and was pleased  The first thing I notice is our waiter looks like a McDonalds reject- his grammar is horrid and he mumbles almost constantly  There is nothing pleasant about this guy I order a beer and fish tacos  After over 20 minutes my beer shows up and is sloshed all over the table  Okay- no big deal I wait and wait and wait Finally my fish tacos show up- or wait- what is this He gives me the plate of food and leaves  I sit staring in amazement wondering why my fish tacos look so funny I look at my plate wave to get his attention and when he finally has time for me he comes over  I tell him ""Hey I don't know what this is but I ordered fish tacos"" His reply Get ready- I've never ever in my life heard this one My waiter the guy who is supposed to make my eating experience here WONDERFUL says ""The guy who got your tacos isn't complaining"" of course I chuckle thinking he is joking when indeed I realize he is NOT  He points across the room to the guy who received my tacos and seemed to have no issue with it I tell him I do not want the mess in front of me but the fish tacos I am surprised he didn't go get the half eaten ones from the other guyI get my fish tacos they were disgusting Poor quality poor taste poor everything  I get the ticket to see not only was I charged for the Steak and enchilada sauce (or whatever it was) but for the TWO plates of fish tacos WOW All I got from this restaurant was a very bitter taste in my mouth."
3241,0,"I love sushi and the sushi here tasted good but- myself and my boyfriend got sick after eating here  We ordered the ""white tuna"" sashimi and a handful of rolls and nigiri  After leaving we learned that ""white tuna"" does not exist it is either albacore or escolar (snake mackerel)  While everything tasted great something did not sit well  Many of our symptoms are in-line with escolar-induced keriorrhea but seem to go beyond that  This experience has made me think twice about going out for sushi again in the future."
4093,0,This place used to be good when Hector owned and operated it  At that time they also had competent staff  It has recently with the past few years turned over many many times  It seems to get worse each time I give it another try  Their bagels are pretty good when they have them but often the service experience and the lack of inventory makes you want to jump through the glass window  By the time my church lets out on Sunday they are usually down to the weird bagels and no sesame or poppy  If there are more than two people in front of you when ordering just run like hell.
3505,0,"I always see coupons for this place and today I found it and gave it a try My first impression walking in was ""eh"" could be better could be worse The service however- Couldn't get any worse I've had days when I wanted to be anywhere but work but this chick behind the counter was so angry/annoyed to be there it was coming off her in waves I ordered a spicy chicken burrito that was BLECH Nothing good about that thing I also ordered a mini steak quesadilla She made me a full sized instead This turned out to be a good thing since the burrito was awful The quesadilla was pretty darn good Needless to say I wont come near this place ever again."
3012,1,Hot pink hummus Now you're speaking my language This place is like a delicious choose your own Mediterranean flavor adventure You can get a pita salad or bowl and fix it up the way you want- sort of like Chipotle or Cafe Rio Everything I tried was outstanding I had two kinds of hummus- beet and cilantro The star for me was beet It was slightly sweet and so pretty on the plate- neon pinkThe chicken was tender and flavorful and the bowl had saffron rice which was also a delight The tzatziki sauce had a slight spicy kick which I've never had but ended up really enjoying as well The owner was working the counter and he was so nice I really hope this place does well I'll be back for sure.
2465,1,WOW The food here is incredible I was absolutely amazed to how great the food tasted as well as how comfortable and relaxed the atmosphere was Will be going back and I definitely recommend.
2638,1,This place is awesome It's my new favorite Indian restaurant My boyfriend and I eat here so much we worry that the owners will think we're stalking them My favorite new discovery there is the Samosa Chaat I'm extremely picky about Indian food and am rarely impressed so for this place to be right in my own neighborhood is a dream come true.
2341,1,What a gemStaff was amazing and skilled in the fine art of customer service My wife and I are locals that wanted a staycation sans kids and to celebrate my wifes bday I booked on Hotelscom and called the resort to confirm Nina was awesome and asked if we were celebrating a special occasion Some reviaewers mentioned the snooty attitudes of the valet staff and tcooksstaff We had no such issues at all They were all wonderful and if you tried to tip valet they reminded you about the resort fee an no tip policy After a pleasant happy hour at t cooks with excellent service we retired to our room only to discover a clean room and chocolates for my wife We will be coming back.
2872,1,Always fantastic food always fantastic service Travis is a Fantastic Chef and Brian and Bo are fantastic managers who always make you feel like your the most important people in the place This is my favorite restaurant.
1332,1,Amy is one of the best hairstylists I have ever been to I went to Pucci salon yesterday for a haircut/style and was very impressed with how much time she took to find out exactly what I wanted and to show me different ways I could style my hair on my own She was very friendly during the haircut and I loved hearing her stories about being a celebrity stylist I will definitely be returning Thanks Amy.

1597,0,Mediocre   Overpriced save yourself the disappointment & money  I order the house special chicken & sweet & sour chicken with 3 PC egg roll  First disappointment was you can't purchase just one egg roll you have to purchase 3 @ 395 then if you want to upgrade to fried rice it's $6 that's crazy  So I passed on that I went to go pick up As they do not deliver I got there and was presented with a bag smaller than a grocery store bag so I asked where the rest of order was the women said it's all there I got hm & there were 4 small food containers 1 box for egg rolls  1 box of house special chicken  1 box sweet & sour & 1 box of rice  One box for both entrees we got one small box  I was pleasantly surprised to see almond cookies a nice touch it so I thought after taking a few bites of dinner my husband & I threw out the food & I tried to eat the almond cookie & thought I was  going to chip my tooth it was do old and hard a total waste of $2700 won't be returning.
366,1,I would like to give this 4 1/2 stars not quite a 5 but really some of the best food we have had in AZ  The food was spicy and well flavored  The ingredients very high quality and fresh  The guac was chopped not mashed great texture  There was no mashed beans or puke looking typical Mexican preparations  Everything was lovely  The Margaritas were the best I have had here they do not use that revolting sweet and sour mix instead they use agave nectar  Service a bit wonky but we still had a great time.

1500,1,I really wish Va Bene was closer  The happy hour is amazing (try the eggplant dish) with great specials on food and drinks  I've had the vodka sauce pasta and that was pretty tasty but mainly I stick to the appetizers and drink specials  Luckily they have happy hour 5 days a week  The crowd is a bit older and they have karaoke after happy hour  If you're a 40something on the prowl watch out  Otherwise come earlier or sit in the dining room to avoid the cougars.
4112,0,"I hate this fucking stinky ghetto shithole My car was broken into here in broad daylight There's always unsavory characters lolling about and that's just the people that work there They roll one distrustful eye up towards you (the other obscured by emo fringe) and glare at you for even daring to disturb them As for the people that shop here if you stand too close you will probably catch lice and get exposed to tuberculosis in one shot Every time I come here without fail there is some sorry sack of shit at the pharmacist counter trying to convince them they just ""lost"" their written prescription for Vicodin or their Percocets got ""stolen"" all with Emmy-award winning shows of anguish and pain So you're asking now why I even come here and I don't blame you I work long hours and this is the closest 24-hour pharmacy to my humble abode Sometimes a girl doesn't have time to  drive to a first-world facility What can I do except clutch my bag extra close scared-old-lady style and take an extra long shower with extra disinfecting soap when I get home."

2450,0,"I can overcome the hipster sneer and accept that I am an uncool blemish in a world full of cut-off corduroys and patterned leggings What I cannot and will not get over is an unapologetic staff whose epic error led to me breaking 5 years of meatless eating because of an order mishapI ordered the red pepper tomato quiche After 20 minutes waiting for the quiche to warm in what appeared to be a 200 degree oven I double checked to make sure my name was on the plate at the counter When I dug in for the first bite a wave of nausea and panic washed over my after realizing this was a piece of the bacon spinach quiche I returned to the counter and explained that I had ordered the vegetarian quiche and the chic who took my order asked the chic behind the counter which one she served because she was sure she got it right The chic in the kitchen said she put them out in the order she got them Then they spent some time looking around in confusion and murmuring a bit  meanwhile all the quiche had been sold So the counter chic simply turned to me and send ""well we don't have anymore of that one""Thanks I told her I was more upset about the fact that I had just put bacon in my mouth after 5 years of no meat than there being no more quiche She did give me my money back but no one apologized or offered me any recompense I'm over you being cooler than me but I'm not over you having no soul."
3959,0,I have been loyal AT&T customer for last 13 years and I have not been so unhappy with the service since an incident happened last month regarding my service  I am letting my sister use one of my phone lines She is just using my phone I am paying the bill and basically she has no authority to add/remove any features to any of my phones/ipad lines Her name does not appear in the bill I am the only account holder for all my phone/tablet services  But last month she decided to walked in to this store and asked if she can upgrade her line to an iPhone without my permission which she was able to do so and I don't know how she was able to do that The person that helped(name Brandon) according to the the Manager(John) verified her identify by checking her ID and compared to the name in the account (which does not match since we do not have the same first and last name) so obviously it was not verified The line she is using is not due for upgrade because I just added it a year ago so they decided to upgrade my iPad line which is not a phone and added different features even change the monthly charges ( I pay $25 per month for 2GB which this particular plan no longer exist) Also added two more features in her line which all of these they made I did not authorize since my sister is not the account supposedly not authorize to do anything with the account except use the phoneBottomline is these people that work here does not even protect the privacy of their customers How can an indviidual possibly say  they have verified her identity and matched it to the account If they did they should have not let her upgrade her line(first of all it is not ready for upgrade) and she is not authorize to user HER NAME DOES NOT APPEAR TO THE ACCOUNT AT ALL Therefore she cannot upgrade/change anything without my permissionI called AT&T and they cannot even help me because they said I have to call this place directly since it is a corporate store and need to speak to the Manager(John) And that whatever happened they are the one to fix it I did speak to the Manager and told me that he will fix it which up to now my account is still not fix My iPad line still showing a phone and new charges  I am paying a lot of money monthly for all the lines I have and this is the kind of service I get RIDICULOUSI do not recommend this store at ALL It is purely but do not provide quality service No customer service at all I have been calling for the last 15 days to get everything fix but so far not everything has been resolved.

1572,1,I honestly love the Clarendon Hotel I celebrated my birthday here with some friends and family and had a blast (from what I remember) The rooms are awesome classy and interesting The window treatments are unique and consist of an almost industrial looking sliding window cover I noticed that the wall art which I can only describe as uniquely edited Arizona scenic photography became a conversation piece by everyone who came in The beds are extremely comfortable like sleeping on a cloud and you better believe we rocked the comfy white robes too The bathroom design is very modern and the only thing I didn't like was that the bathtub was pretty small which makes it hard to have bubble baths :) We took advantage of the mini fridge which we were excited had a freezer The hotel provides bags of ice too which I liked better than having to go back and forth to an ice machine The ice did leak into the fridge though soaking my cake in water but I forgive them for that They had FREE snacks that you could get a the front desk if you just ask and they have some good choices like goldfish kit kats m&m's just to name a few Some of my guests also grabbed some food from Gallo Blanco and all of it tasted really good I have no idea what I tried so I can't give a valid review of the food They have a cool hallway with the history of the hotel and its connections with some crazy mob gangs I recommend you take a look  The rooftop baroh how the view is amazing I was surprised that it wasn't packed on a weekend night but happily surprised because it felt like I had my own private rooftop event There are bartenders up there but we had our own supply in the room so we would just go back and forth from the room to the roof all night We had so much fun or TOO much fun I know this because me and the fiance didn't make it out to the bars lol We don't really remember but we had a little too much to drink and our friends made a decision that we should call it a night LOL We woke up a little late and the front desk called they were nice enough to let us check out late The pool is gorgeous and awesome Our friends enjoyed it plenty while we suffered with a nasty hangover :) Good times.
1558,1,My husband and I went here for a date night and it was the best date night ever I have been to one other reflexology place and this one is by far so much superior The therapist I had was amazingworking every part of the body Even though you are fully clothed you don't feel like the massage is compromised in any way We were both so relaxed by the end The scalp and foot massages are excellent And then they put a nice hot pack under your neck to continue soothing the muscles You can't been an hour's massage for only $30 and $55 for a couple I will definitely be back.

262,1,My all-time favorite bar in Gilbert  Friendly dive bar atmosphere and get this It's not sticky  All the bartenders are extremely nice and the owner is usually working  After my first time there they were already makingnan effort to remember my name  The have trivia games available  Everyone is friendly and there are always some kind of shot/drink specialThe drink selection is beyond impressive for beer  They have over a dozen different beers on tap  The bar is extremely long and there is always room for you and your group  Hightop seating as well as booths and regular tables are also available however I rarely use them sincei prefer the bar seating  There is 4 pool tables which are usually available except of Fridays which is tournament night  Karaoke is on Saturday but unfortunately everyone sucks  You really can't go wrong with this bar  Just remember this is a dive and not Mill Ave or ScottsdaleHad my birthday party here this year too bad I don't remember it.

2191,1,Absolutely incredible experience My boyfriend took me here for my 20th birthday and got me the 'Romance Package' We got our own private little booth with curtains a bouquet of roses and what seemed to be our own personal server She was probably helping other tables as well but she made us seem like we were the only ones in the place The food was not only amazing it was an extraordinarily fun experience We cooked it to our own tastes and there was so much extra to choose from The portions are perfect for two and we could barely walk out of the restaurant afterwards because of all the different courses I will definitely be visiting The Melting Pot as often as I can Although a bit pricy the ambience food and experience is completely worth it.

1386,1,Cibo has plenty of reviews but I still gotta put my two cents in I have been here several times all for lunch so I have NOT tried their pizza yet but the sandwiches and salads they serve up for lunch are nothing short of phenominal On my last vist I tried the Ai Spinaci which is a garlic lovers dream sandwich topped off with wilted spinach and toasted prosciutto All I hear is great things about Cibo's pizza so I can't wait to finally give it a tryThe restaurant is a beautifully converted house in a historic downtown area but that also equals very limited seating inside They have a great patio with more than ample overflow seating outside but it's pretty worthless during the summer days The servers here are all friendly towards the customers and work as a team to make sure the lunch and dinner hours run smoothlyAlso the crepes are amazing We never had any intention of ordering dessert but our server insisted on bringing us a complimentary crepe with the assurance that it'd be worth it WE LOVED IT Make sure you save room for dessert.

4480,0,I heard ownership changedand since I was at the cleaners next door my timing seemed right  I have since been advised the ownership did not change only the managementIn entering the NEW front door for Papaya Thai even though the Open sign is on I see no one and hear no one  I walked from the front door to the back but no luck  I picked up the go menu and was just about to leave when I hear a voice  Turning to my right there is an entryway into the Pho restaurant next door  I asked if the Thai restaurant is open and was advised it is I would just have a seat at a table in the Pho restaurantBetween the 32 seats in the Thai restaurant and about 40 in the Pho place plenty of seats  I am the only customer in either oneabout 3 PM on a Monday afternoon  Decorations are subtle everything appears clean Hostess/waitress comes by with an order pad and asks what I would like  I ordered Som Tom no green beans or shrimp (not listed in the menu but I have received one or the other too many times) and Thai hot as it is listed on the menu how I should order  Hostess did not know the Thai name for the papaya salad (she seems to be Chinese)  I pointed at papaya salad on the menu  She wrote down my order and headed to the kitchenI got out my cellphone and proceeded to update on the news of the world  A couple minutes later the waitress called from the kitchen door asking what I would like to drink  I requested water and was served water in a glass with a slice of lime in it  About 10 minutes passed from order to deliveryA properly prepared Som Tom is made up of julienned green papaya garlic fresh tomato palm sugar thai rat chile freshly squeezed lime juice and fish sauce The salad that appeared has the traditional salad ingredients along with ingredients that have no business being in the salad  Som Tom does not include cilantro  This version had the green papaya fresh tomato and fish sauce  The chile looked to be red chile from Mexico (the seeds are bigger than thai rat chile) and the zing from the lime was not therePortion size was admirable 2 cups on a lettuce leaf  Still not worth my time.
4152,0,This is by far the worst towing company in arizona In the process of towing my car onto their flatbed they twisted my chassis and completely shattered my back window The fat a** kid who towed my car apparently didn't know what he was doing and didnt notice what he had done I've submitted a claim the day they towed my vehicle and was told someone would get back to me within 700 business days Two weeks passed and no call i tried calling their corporate office left several messages and still no response Ive tried talking to their hr department and all they told me was i have to talk to claims This company is so shady and so unprofessional with no respect for personal property.
3913,0,Very bland food an incompetent waiter and dirty dishes and flatware  The draft beer was totally flat Pretty awful.
3356,0,This is the absolute worst service I have ever had I had dial up that was more reliable I have spent more time trying to get a connection than actually using it and it keeps dropping the connection I had wireless with a phone company on the same computer that was faster and flawless They came out and relocated the router that lasted about a day and same sH*t the next morning I am switching to ANYTHING but COX and never again Run run run away and get anything but Cox.
226,1,This place is great only problem I had was deciding what yo eat  You walk in and the smell of great food over comes you  Staff was very helpful and the food was very good and lots to choose from everyone in our party was please with their lunch.
2151,1,I think I have died and gone to DVF heaven  (That's Diane von Furstenberg for you non fashionistas out there)  Seriously by the time I was three racks into Twist I was melting into a puddle of bliss  So many DVF styles and patternsit should be illegal to sell that many in one place  My poor heart can't take itAnyways after I regained my composure and continued shopping I was greeted with even more fabulous dresses and tops- Rebecca Taylor Plenty Lewis Choit was pure heaven  The store is stocked with great fashion forward piecesnot fashion 4 months ago pieces I almost sent a text message to Dorian G telling her to get on the next plane and come out here to this store  I selected 5 things to try on and halfway through the super nice (and cute) sales associate came by with a few more dresses to try on  Everything he brought me fit perfectly and was right on with my style  I seriously wanted to buy 8 things  I restrained myself to come back with my husband to have him help me narrow them downThe sales associates were super nice the store is huge and full of wonderful itemswhat more could you want  Oh yeah I got a parking spot right in front  That was cool too.
3164,0,First I hope management notices that this is a repeat review urging them to get rid of the gorilla I was excited to see a brewery open up over here but I was let down with the food and the Nimbus beer We've tried pretzels fried jalepenos sliders and the spinach artichoke dip (no flavor except for the chives and would never recommend or order again) I've tried all of the different beers and favorite so far is the red with a taste of honey but all the other beers are just okay We asked our server if they have a Nimbus IPA he said yes but then returned to let us know he was confused and suggested some other local beersIt's kind of a weird vibe because it seems like brewery but there is a mascot gorilla running around to be awkward with patrons and they have cartoons on TV during happy hour I'm not sure which demographic this place is supposed to appeal to Server was nice attentive and kept glasses full and I do really dig the patio so I'll round this rating up to 3 stars They're brand new and they have good happy hour so I'll be back to give them and their other menu items another try as long as I don't see the gorilla in the front.
732,1,Best brewery on the west side Burgers and service are top notch We love our waitress Shannon and the outdoor patio.
4640,0,"I used to go to this car wash every other week  The staff was friendly the car wash was pretty good & pricing was in line with most other car washes  Over the last 6 months the staff has gone down hill & so has the wash quality  I drive a 2002 Nissan Xterra & I am reasonable with my expectations of going to a car wash  I realize I will always spend about 30 minutes at home touching up the missed spots as no car wash gets your car clean to the way you like it  With that said the job they have done is terrible  I went there this last Saturday my car was really dirty & covered in dirt so I actually went to a self service carwash prior to going here & I spent $5 spraying down my car & the underbelly so that it wouldn't be as difficult to clean  When I got to the carwash the first thing the gentleman that approached my car asked was ""did you already clean your car"" & I explained that I just washed it down but need a full cleaning  I paid $25 for an upgrade job along with the usual $1 oversize vehicle fee  When they finished my car I gave a $5 tip & left  All in all I spent $31 at this car wash  When I got home & went over my car I was astounded at how much visible dirt there still was on my car  The door jams looked like they were not even wiped down  I ended up spending TWO HOURS re-cleaning my car to get it to the level I expect when I am paying $31  Not to mention when you're waiting for your car they have one couch a couple table top seats & two massage chairs that specifically state don't sit here unless paying for a massage  SeriouslyI was shocked the first time I saw they added these chairs  People are already paying for a service & now your trying to nickle & dime them for more  This place has gone extremely down hill I have been a customer there for over 4 years now & I am done  This was my last car wash & I will find somewhere else to go  And to make things worse the quality used to be good enough that I lived right across the street & I moved a year ago about 5 miles down the road & yet I continued going here because the service was good now its not worth my time or effort as a consumer to go here."
112,1,"I have always loved Indian food and having tried in several different countries dozens of different restaurants and nearly every meat and vegetarian dish this cuisine can offer I can wholeheartedly say that this restaurant was beyond my greatest experiences with Indian food outside of IndiaYou have to go into the restaurant expecting a family run restaurant atmosphere This is by no means a 5 star restaurant it's a 5 star experience It's like visiting your grandmother's house for a home cooked mealThe chicken Tikka masalas and paneer are all to die for I asked for my dishes extra spicy and after a brief ""oh no not Indian spicy"" argument from the owner I received my dish just as hot as they would serve it to a native DeliciousThe Garlic Naan and other breads (parantha etc) are great and all deliciously homemadeThis restaurant has been around for a LONG time and if you haven't tried it yet it's a must."
2261,1,Woo Hoo another fantastic downtown dining spot I have always loved Fate (Johnny Chu's other downtown joint) but Sens rocks it hard brilliant food and superb drinksThe food is referred to as Asian Tapas exactly what it is Small portions ridiculously big on flavorThe Miso soup was the best I have ever experienced Chock full o' mushrooms and other delightsthe salad special of banana sprouts and other items I can't quite recall Perhaps the flavor euphoria has drained some of my memoryI'm not big on long-winded reviews so try it then sit back and listen to your inner contented self you will say yum too.

2758,1,Love this place I only shop here and at the Asian or Mexican markets.
4770,0,I wish I could give my opinion on the food but unfortunately we never made it past the chips It was a slow Tuesday night and there were only a few people in the restaurant We never had a server come to our table Waited 15 mins and nothing We did get chips which were from a bag and not fresh The salsa was also not very stellar We walked out without an acknowledgement from anyone  Never going back.
3750,0,"If you want your waitress to get drinks for three tables at the same time and take time to take an order at another table while carrying your drinks Ling and Louie's is your place If you want your appetizer salad and entree to arrive at the same time ling and Louies is your place If when you complain you want a manager to say "" this is unfortunate "" Ling and Louies is your place He did say that they would do better next time With lots of good restaurants in Phoenix/Scottsdale there will not be a next time We eat out at the best restaurants in the area four nights a week Trust me missing Ling and Louies will not be a great loss Incidentally this is the first time that I have ever written a bad review for a restaurant."

19,1,When I had mentioned to my girlfriend I had never been to Postino's she said REALLY  Well then you are in for a treat  She wasn't kidding  Who said a wine bar won't get crowded in late June during 109 degree temperature  And this was at their new location on Central (just north of Camelback) The four of us shared the Bruschetta SELECTION OF 4 so we all got to pick and share  We enjoyed the Brie & Apple w/Fig Spread Fresh Mozzarella with Tomato & Basil Ricotta with Dates & Pistachios and Warm Artichoke Spread  Their portions are very generous and each bruschetta is cut in 4 so you don't have to struggle with it yourself  Anyone who knows me well knows I ALWAYS slice my sandwiches in 4easier to eat :-)  Wine by the glass 11am-5pm 7 days a weekyay.
789,1,Love the family atmosphere very welcoming & friendly excellent service & beautiful quality jewelry.
3287,0,The service here is terrible  The place was empty  We waited for fifteen minutes or more  I finally asked if we could be seated in one of the many empty tables  The answer was we do not have enough servers to seat you  We sat another ten minutes and finally gave up and left  Maybe they should hire a few more waitresses  These people did not care one bit if you waited forever  The worst part was only a very few tables had customers  This is the only complaint I have ever written  I will never return to this restaurant.
2756,1,Another great shop This coffee shop is right in the heart of OT Scottsdale The coffee is strong service is great and the environment makes for a productive work session Check it out.
4689,0,I wanted to like this place but the service we experienced here was awful and soured everything It didn't start off bad we made reservations and the hostess was friendly She seated us promptly in a nice comfy booth and we received a breadbasket with crudités to munch on When our waiter came to take our orders we informed him we'd be ordering off the Restaurant Week menu and he made this face of dismay and haughty superiority Apparently Restaurant Week offended our waiter This is where it went downhill as from here on out our waiter had an attitude As a first course we had the option of salad or soup We asked if we could have Caesar dressing on our salad and at first the waiter looked upset that we'd make such a request and looked ready to refuse but relented and said yes However we found out later that this was an additional charge that he did not mention to us (Extra $10 really) The salad was average nothing to write home about For our second course both of us ordered the prime rib with creamed horseradish which was disappointing (Again when placing our order the waiter seemed really upset - like we were asking him to butcher the cow and then cook us the meal himself) The prime rib was average thickness about half an inch and a rather large portion but the flavor was lackluster Even the horseradish which my husband loves didn't help For dessert I ordered the chocolate mousse and my husband ordered the cheesecake I wasn't very impressed with the mousse as it had a citrusy flavor - which was not mentioned on the menu and ruined it for me (I like my mousse decadent - a deep chocolate flavor This wasn't) The cheesecake was good but my husband would eat any cheesecakeThen we waited And we waited The waiter had disappeared on us We waited for a good 20 minutes before we saw him anywhere near our table My husband had to flag him down and request our bill Again the waiter looked like we were asking him to chop down a tree make both the paper and ink and then write our receipt in calligraphy After a few minutes he came back with our bill and promptly disappeared again We were shocked to see the extra fee for our salads as it wasn't explained to us (we would have been fine if it was expressed to us) but unfortunately we couldn't find our waiter Obviously we couldn't use our credit card (no waiter to process the card) and we had enough cash to pay for the meal plus tip This is the first time we ever did not want to leave a tip but lucky for this waiter we felt so unwanted that we just dropped our cash and leftWe won't be back.
1856,1,Everything I have ever ordered here is AMAZINGI even turned my 'meat & potato's' husband onto this place who had lunch with me here  'just to please me'He now eats his lunch here EVERY Wednesday like clockworkWe are both addicted I adore the thai peanut bowl and hubby loves the mexicali burger The garlic hummus is also YUMMY as is the No Harm Chicken ParmMy only gripe is that they dont have a 2nd location in North Scottsdale(hint-hint).
2442,1,Fun place great karaoke and awesome servers Can't forget the tasty tacos.
38,1,So glad I stopped in here Was a last minute check in after I found out I was released from being on call all day In need of a pedi bad and this place is right down the street so I went in at 5pm I went for the ultimate spa pedi (decided to really treat myself) Was not disappointed one bit For 4900 got all the add ons hot scrub hot lotion paraffin wax soak  a hot stone foot massage and the results= two very happy and exhilarated feet My tech was Kevin and he was awesome The place is beautiful quiet and liked the fact that the pedi stations are in back and away from the front Felt very relaxed and soothed Thank you Biagio and Kevin.
4189,0,If you read this review please also read Nathan's comment belowI hesitated to write a negative review about this place because I know it is local but its food didn't taste local or homemade to me I am not exaggerating when I say a breakfast sandwich from PCrossant is no better than one from McDonalds  Pre-made lumps of single-colored scambled egg rubbery cheese watery sausage patty and a croissant that tastes like it has been refrigerated for days  Not flaky or buttery or soft on the inside  Kind of mashed down and a sickly yellow color  Meanest review ever  Sorry PCroissant  But it's true  I'll never go back.
1916,1,I cannot begin to express how elated I was after eating at this establishment Decided Sunday morning to try a new breakfast place and after a failed attempt at TC Eggingtons found this place via a Yelp recommendation for their Eggs Benedict Drove across town to The Gilbert House which is situated right outside of 'old town' Gilbert The minute we walked up to the front door we were greeted and seated immediately by their staff Our waitress took our drink orders practically as we had just finished sitting down and with our minds made up as to what we were going to order placed our orders promptly in the kitchen The food came out in a flash and the presentation of our dishes was phenomenal I cannot even begin to tell you how impressed I was with the cleanliness of this restaurant in particular their silverware I've been out to eat many times and never once have I had such impeccable service and food The owners of this establishment should be extremely proud of the wonderful staff they've hired.
1173,1,"Went here last night to take advantage of the Arizona Restaurant Week menu and Modern Steak still deserves five stars    Made a reservation through OpenTable and when we arrived we were seated promptly even though the restaurant was a packed house   The menu choices were excellent Three courses for $2900 and they also offered $3000 bottles of wine of which we chose a wonderful Shiraz  Everyone in our party chose the Filet Mignon as their entree seeing as how just the Filet alone on the normal dinner menu goes for $3500  They give you four choices of starters and entrees where most of the Restaurant Week menus only offer three choices   Also the items they offered on the Restaurant Week menu are actually on the dinner menu    They did not create a menu specifically for Restaurant Week   One of our party members stated ""this is the best steak I have ever had""   Beautiful decor throughout the restaurant and bar and great outdoor patio too."
2114,1,I used to come here all the time during high school Inexpensive food great greasy burgers the fries here are delicious They have many different flavors of milkshakes  I usually get the butterscotch  No restrooms limited seating space I recommend getting your food to go.
3418,0,My kids love this place and I keep getting suckered back in but never again  Ants on the table was a bit much-and the lack of apology or offer to discount or meal sealed it for me  This place is banned from my list forever.
1818,1,I like this place It's clean the staff is helpful and they have a lot of toppings to choose from  This was my first Time here I have no complaints.
1299,1,Glad I tried itI had an extremely negative experience at the Biltmore location that I was hesitant to try this location but so glAd that I didDelicious food and good service.
270,1,Holly was awesome and I was looking for a black cinnamon herbal mix She picked out a couple with me and actually suggested something out of left field a early grey tea which I'm not a fan of but one sniff and I had to try it I bought more then I thought I would love the prices of the tea I'll be back for sure since I just finished my tea about a week ago its about time lol.
3211,0,For a restaurant that touts to have the largest wine list in Phoenix and carries Fernet Branca to boot I am alarmed to learn that they no longer stock Drambuie The consequence No ordering a Rusty Nail to go with those awesome mushrooms Much less any other drink that requires this apparently elusive liqueurAlso off the list:Bonny PrinceCumulusKiltlifterLoch LomondWarm Wooly SheepBon appetit and but no bottoms up.
345,1,"This is a beautiful modern library It lets in a lot of natural light for reading It was built to reflect Arizona's geology (sun canyon formations etc) and you will notice the ""canyon walls"" feel in the atrium The outside resembles a mesa from the side There is a large collection of books (though you will find a more scholarly/academic selection at Hayden Library at ASU Main) and plenty of space for reading Floor-to-roof windows cover the north and south ends of the building and whether or not you wish to do any reading you will get great views of Downtown and Midtown Phoenix from the top floor."
1908,1,Carrie is very professional friendly and personable  I always feel like I'm catching up with a friend  She does an awesome job and gives honest feedback.
813,1,The Phoenix open is a really good time and 75% of it comes down to the 16th hole For those that haven't been: It's a short par 3 that is fully enclosed by grandstand seating It seats a lot of people and it's very rowdy and VERY loud It is the least traditional golf environment you could imagine and it's a lot of funUpon teeing off the players are met with either rousing cheers or loud boos depending on where their tee shots land The crowd screams at the caddies trying to get them to sprint up onto the green If they ever do the crowd goes wild If there's a great shot the crowd goes wild Some golfers throw gear into the crowd and they go wild The moral of the story here is that it's wild There are private areas and spaces for corporate sponsors which would be the way to be here if you can find a way in When I come back next year I'll likely spend the vast majority of my time at the 16th hole It's so much fun and also a drunken shit show with all the lushes around youSome adviceGet here early because they'll start running a line While it's worth the wait to get in you'll enjoy it more if you don't have to wait Also bring/wear sunblock because regardless of where you sit you'll be in the sun pretty much all day.
160,1,For a white/hispanic/german dude this place was OFF THE HOOK GOOD It matched all my taste buds needs The jewish sliders are so tasty with the fries and gravy Our server David was really great and funny and kept our drinks full The cookies at the counter kept the kids enthralled and the prices great food and great service kept me more than thrilled.
2102,1,I needed a new starting motor for my 1981 Kawasaki They had one It took a little time to find one but I am guessing they have one of everything even for a 30 year-old bike Everyone is extremely friendly and knowledgable If you don't know how to replace a part they can definitely show you how They even test parts for you to make sure that the part you brought in was faulty I now need a new speedometer Bob's will see me again this week.
1651,1,"Yupha Thai is definitely a ""yuppy"" in terms of being a great spot to go to  There are not too many places to eat near ASU Research Park which is right off the 101 and Elliot  Yupha is about a couple miles west on Elliot off the 101 freeway  I entered in and saw the special of the day which was a pumpkin dish with whatever meat or tofu  Most Thai dishes are known to be pretty spicy and I was curious to try something more on the sweeter end  It was still right after Thanksgiving and it was an appropriate time to try a festive dishWhile I was waiting they offered us a soup and salad bar to get something to appease us for a few minutes  This is the first time I have ever seen this which is the main reason this rating goes from a 4 to a 5 star  The pumpkin dish was really good  The thai spices to go along with the sweetness was the ultimate complement  All of my friends loved their meals too."
3889,0,Very unhappy with the experience of having to stand outside forever and then inside The people inside suck ass as well very rude inconsiderate and not helpful at all If you don't like your job find a new one Seriously.
4275,0,This review is for the service dept of Shasta pools not a store I've never had a problem with the guys who came to do the work on my pool equipment The problem is with the people who answer the phone I noticed last time I called I would be put on hold by the automated system for a long time (like maybe 10 minutes or more) The only way to get to talk to someone was to leave a message then I got a call back within minutes I thought that was really strange It happened twice So I scheduled a service call A few days before it was going to happen I had something come up and needed to cancel I called again had to leave a message after being on hold to speak to a person When the rep looked on the schedule she said it was never even put in the system Too strange for me I'm not calling them again.
2364,1,Favorite QT Employees always greet you right as you walk in the door and they are super fast at checkout.
2697,1,I won't rave on and on as you have probably already read everything that I am going to say This place is awesome The french toast sausage and (drum roll please)the carne adovada are among my favorite dishes The bloody marys are great too They actually come with a side of beer This place is hard to find Just look for the hardware store in the the plaza and it will be directly to the left of it and to the right of Luci's.
3412,0,Used to come here almost everyday Now a bunch of dirty teens work at night laughing and pushing eachother around in the back Fries were soggy and cold and were covered in sticky red stuff This stucky red stuff also on my drink I was so discussed I wanted to puke Threw it all out and will NEVER be coming back You could not pay me to eat here again.
2695,1,I have been referred to go here by 3 different people and I finally went today  Wow This place is awesome  Yes it is crowded but it didn't bother me a bit  It was actually a fun way to spend a Saturday afternoon with my boyfriend oohing and aahing at all the choices and the ridiculously low prices  It seems like everything was under a dollar or maybe just over I got 3 heavy bags full of stuff for $15 which included quite a few things that are pricey in the regular grocery stores this time of year  I'm definitely now inspired to cook up something good from my fully stocked fridge.
4762,0,I have been a patient of Dr Lieber for over a year and I would not recommend him or his office to anyone  Making appointments are the only thing that is easy to do  His bed side manner is gruff and I felt like he just wanted me out of there  One time he asked me if I wanted my medicine dose increased  I said I don't know what do you suggest  He asked what I thought   Getting scripts filled and talking to anyone takes at least 1 to 2 days  I was without several medications for 5 days and an other for 2 weeks while we waited for blood work even though I had been on  medicine for 9 years  The assistant told me 3 different times she would call me and never did  I had to call her each time and wait 1 to 2 days for a call back  I'm currently waiting 2 weeks for another medicine that was to be called in and I just found out it hasn't been  I've been without this medicine for a week  I won't get a call back until tomorrow at the earliest because his assistant won't talk to you the same day  Last time I had to go into the office asking for my scripts because I wasn't getting a call back and the scripts weren't called in  The Dr was off when I went in and the lady Dr he shares an office with wouldn't fill my scripts  I had to go to my cardiologist to get them filled even though I had been trying for the 2 weeks to get Lieber to fill them   Once I get this last script filled I'm going to another Dr  I have never had this type of relationship with a Dr before in my life  If I could have given him and his staff 0 stars I would have.
2764,1,Hands down I just ate the best bagel I've ever tasted I enjoy lox so much that I buy the Philadelphia cream cheese with salmon in it because it's the closest substitute I can afford on a regular basisI've had good lox in New Orleans but I really haven't been thrilled with the bagels I've had here That changed however upon my first visit to NY Bagels and DeliThere was a constant flow of patrons and the wait was negligible The place is clean and the tv (bonus pts for having ESPN on) was without volume keeping the noise level appropriate They had almost every kind of bagel in stock including blueberry jalapeno spinach and the standards like everything sesame salt etc I chose the Nova on an onion bagel which is smoked salmon cream cheese capers red onions and tomato The salmon portion was very generous for a $7 breakfast I don't mind paying that much for a sandwich that doesn't skimp on quality ingredients As others stated the bagel has a great crispy exterior and fabulous fluffy interior I highly recommend this place if you're on the north side of Phoenix.
4506,0,I had the basic car wash today The plastic scratched the hood and trunk of my car It also dropped chemicals which took paint off mycar I took pictures I called and left a message I hope some one cares.
236,0,This establishment damaged my brand new sweater When I went to pick it up the brand name label was missing from the neck area and there was a hole where the label used to be When I showed it to the store owner he accused me of lying and saying that the sweater was not new and that it had been dry cleaned many times He asked for proof of purchase and kept saying that the label would not have fallen off by just cleaning it once Horrible service Horrible owner and an abhorrent attitude Never going back there again FOLKS KEEP AWAY FROM THIS PLACE.

1034,1,I'll fully admit that I am a regular of this Pita Jungle location I come here an average of times a week Usually I meet friends for their awesome Happy Hour and come on the weekend for dinner with my Husband or FamilyThe servers area always really attentive and helpful They are great with substitutions and picky orders When at Happy Hour I don't really drink the alcoholic beverages but prefer their Decaf Berry Iced Tea which is delicious Happy Hour is CHEAP and served Tapas style (I believe it is from 3-5:30 and then Reverse from 9-close) For $6 I can get a full mealI usually get an array of the following:-Falafel with Tahni (This is always delicous just the right seasoning and texture)-Hummus Trio (I love their Hummus flavorful smooth and just the right consistency You get about two-three tablespoons per order)-Feta (They give you a block of feta cheese drizzled with olive oil and topped with chopped cucumbers onion and tomato zataar as well It's delicious)-Baba Ghanoush (REALLY nice and creamy I don't love egglplant but I love the subtle smokiness of this dip)-Pita with Thyme and Olive Oil (This is basically a small pizza with olive oil thyme tomatoes feta and kalamata olives It's perfectlly cooked and always yummy)-Olives (They would probably be a little bit better if they were heated but they have a great variety)The dips are served with Pita and it is always the perfect consistency Just soft enough but still with a little chewAll of these items run $1 or $2 It's incredibleI'm a vegetarian but I know that my friends enjoy the Chicken and Shrimp options They also have a very fresh looking caprese tapaFor dinners I've tried a variety of Items I really like the Mediterranean Platter but it's just too much food for me I love their cold garlic and tomato green beans that come on this dish but you can also get them as a side dishI often get an order of Lentils and Rice Feta Cheese Small side of hummus and 2 falafel balls (which come with their rich and awesome Tahini) I mix them all together and made a Mediterranean Burrito Bowl It's awesome and I always appreciate that the wait staff is accommodatingAlso their Red Lentil soup is a notable starter It's really perfectly balanced and flavorfulMy husband is easier than me He enjoys the Chicken Tikka Masala or Chicken Shwarma He also likes the Mediterranean Chicken Salad We come with large groups and people always seem to enjoy their meals and order a variety of menu itemsThey have a great patio which we enjoy sitting on for nice days/nightsFor large groups- as far as I know they don't take reservation and sometimes there's a 30-40 minute wait for groups bigger than 4 on a Saturday night We never really mind waiting thoughI love Pita Jungle.
4911,0,The customer is not always right but when u pay for something it should be what u orderedNot something u didnt want then asked if its okthen attitude when i say no thats not what i wantedthen brought me the comepletly wrong thing after thatI went to this location on a tuesday night not very busy and had the worst service and over all experience ever at a restaurant I could write an essay on everything that happened that made me feel this way but I just want to save u time and NOT go to this location I will never ever recommend someone here.
3876,0,Decided to check the place out last night as it's in my neighborhood To say the service was poor would be admitting there was service Walked in was told there was a show and to choose either a place at the bar or the tables at the end or on the patio choose the inside Sat down 10 minutes later waitress hands me a menu 20 minutes later I walk out with out anyone asking me for a drink or what I wanted to eat Had heard good things about the place In my opinion avoid like the plague.
3629,0,Absolutely horrible place Snakes was treated like pieces of shit and we WILL NOT stand for it The manager is a complete asshole and doesnt give a shit if you have a good time or not as long as he gets his money Completely unprofessional and neither myself or any of my friends will ever set foot in this hell hole of a place ever again.
591,1,Citrine has become my latest beauty obsession  The staff are friendly knowledgeable and helpful without being pushy  I have slowly started to phase out my former makeup products as I run out of things (you have got to try the mascara) I highly recommend this little gem at UNION at The Biltmore.
2879,0,Sorry  Maybe my expectations were too high as many folks had told me how great this place was and specifically how great the BBQ was In fact the BBQ spare ribs may have been the worst I've ever endured and even that might have been given a slight pass had the wait staff been even remotely nice or friendly  But that was not the case either so we had an awful meal served by a staff that even a mother couldn't love and for this cowboy I'll not be back  Ever.
1569,0,First offit is extremely difficult looking for this place as its in the back of the hospital and there is no sign at all saying that the pediatrics is located there which is annoying My daughter is a new patient with them and the first time I called to schedule a appointment the lady was rude and always interrupted when I spokethere was a day where I couldn't make it in and I called to see if I could schedule a later apptand the receptionist said abruptly that I couldn't because the doctor was leaving and there are no open spots today and I needed to take my daughter in right at that very moment another day I came in the doctor we asked to be my daughters doctor and I even know what she looks like wasn't even our doctorshe didn't even tell us her nameshe didn't even physically check on my daughter and I had to do all the worknot to mention this day I came in to check up on my daughter's burn marks She didn't say much and didn't really do anything I'm very hesitant to even tske my daughter back here as of now I just called to schedule another apptalso not even to mention AGAIN the previous time we were there they didn't even let us know when to come back againso as of now I called in to schedule another check up they open at 8 Yeah I'm pretty sure  Ring Ring no answercall againring ring no answer called 4 times and no answer No they were not busy it rang for a long time I'm not site if they're busy or ignoring calls But I'm giving them one more chance and if it it blows bye bye arrowhead pediatrics.
725,1,I'm enjoying coming her for PT to improve a hamstring injury  They are great with being flexible with my schedule and all the PT assistants there are very knowledgeable and help me with form while doing my exercises  My PT Chris is a nice guy knowledgeable and correctly diagnosed my injury  They use Astym to help heal the injury (hurts but effective) and give me a lot of exercises to do  Very clean place and convenient location/easy parking.
4423,0,WORST customer service EVER Extremely rude and VERY unorganized Will NEVER return It amazes me how a small business like this would treat customers as they did me and my sister maybe it was becuase we were women They told us a different story everyday about an item we ordered We finally received it 4 weeks later When we were told the day we ordered it it would be in the next day Plus you walk in to the place and there is just stuff EVERYWHERE just clutter and not very appealing at all.
1415,1,What is there to say about La Condesa It's simply amazing I'll admit we found this place searching for more of a day-to-day less expensive version of Barrio Cafe We found that and more In our one month since we've moved to Phoenix we've eaten here three times By far the best item we've had is the fried quesadilla with mole chicken Oh and the horchata Best Horchata Ever It's not your typical horchata so watch out Mole poblano tacos are also heaven as is the cochinita pibil Salsa bar is to die for I love the hole in the wall vibe Only bad moment was that I got trapped in the bathroom but that was my fault I swear the door opens out not in This place is super casual Plastic cups and nothing fancy but the vibe is uber awesome It is very small and seating can be limited but it always seems to work out I don't recommend this place for very large groups We'll be back about once a week.
3522,0,My wife use to work there they don't wash their hands they use expired sauces from a FEW years back and treat their staff like animals the food tastes good but if you get a stomach ache after you know why Here's a tip don't eat the salad.
558,1,I was here for lunch and I tried the gipsy soup It was really good: hot creamy tastefull My hubby ate Ahi tuna salad which was very nice presented and very good and my friend choose a salmon sandwich with sweet potatoes which was very good as well ( the bread especially was really good)I love the atmosphere their decorations ( the lady bathroom is so glam ) and the location I definitely will come back.
2559,1,Wowzerz this was a great event What a way to kick off 2014Where was this place back when I lived down the street But I digress Salty Sow definitely adds some zest to an already nice block of restaurants Driving up the building pops out from the street Once inside we were greeted with aluminum water bottles and a challenge to find our New Year's resolution amongst the awaiting tables I wish I'd known because my resolution makes me sound illiterate Again I digressThe food was simply outstanding And the service: above superior I opted to try the sangria made with frozen grapes elderflower liquor and champagne So refreshing and not too sweet Our spread of delectables was hosted by none other than the general manager Beth and the chef Harold Marmulstein My favorites were the pork ragout pork shoulder and Brussels sprout leaves The flavors and consistency of everything tasted fresh and dynamic It's one of those menus that can do no wrong Desert was the icing on the proverbial cake Bananas Foster beignets and a butterscotch custard that had everyone swooning Thank you to Salty Sow and our gracious hosts for an amazing dinner with some great people And thanks to Lindsey and Yelp for letting us enjoy such excellent flavors and ambiance Congrats to all those Gold Elites out there - I hope to one day join your ranks See everyone on Yelp and the next event.
3515,0,"Don't believe the hype I heard about their ""awesome"" margaritas and decided to give them a shot before leaving Arizona First the bartender was an a--hole I asked for the rita I've been hearing so much about and he serves me some frozen thing with chambord I told myself this must not be the thing I've heard such ravings about so decided to choke that thing down along with their sad excuse of chicken tortilla soup - which had VERY LITTLE cheese and chicken but plenty of broth that looked like diarrhea After all of this grossness I asked the bartender for the better rita that is not frozen He told me that their best ritas WERE the frozen ones When I heard that I got Z'Hell outta that place Can't wait to be back home in Dallas for a REAL rita at Ojeda's and Monica's."
2278,1,I've been using Magic Pest since I moved into my home 15 years ago   The people they send to spray are considerate and efficient  The treatments are effective and priced right  I'm glad I found them and would definitely recommend using them.
4533,0,No starsMy wife and I were looking for something different in Glendale \ Peoria area  Lots of the usual chains here and since we had never been in Firebirds we might as well try it  MistakeIt wasn't that busy and we were told by the door holder (can't call her a hostess since she was no host) said to sit anywhere  We waited 15 minutes just to get the waitress to come take drink orders  Not a good startOur Queso with Chips was cold when it came out  Our meals were bland greasy bar food  My ribs tasted like they were bought from Safeway  And service continued to be ridiculously poorYelp makes me give it a star which it doesn't deserve  Spending $60 for dinner for 2 and having it be this bad an experience deserves no stars  Do not waste your time at this poor excuse for a sports bar  There are many better choices.
130,1,"Agritopia finally exists as an establishment to Yelp about I believe that Agritopia is one of the premiere developments in the state for everything you want in a neighborhood As I write this I hear birds chirping in the trees and can spot residents cycling through the streets enjoying the meticulously landscaped neighborhoodWhen I first ventured out to Gilbert nearly 4 years ago I drove by Agritopia and immediately thought ""This is a neighborhood from Desperate Housewives"" Turns out I was wrong Dead wrong I told myself that I could never live in a neighborhood that seemed like it was nothing more that a clean pristine facade However nearly a year ago I moved into the neighborhood and it was one of the best decisions I have ever made Here's why:Location: Direct access to the Loop 202 makes it easy to get anywhere in the Valley in about 30 minutes Also nearby is San Tan Village Mall The mall is growing and developing into a nice outdoor mall with mid-range to upscale shopsNeighborhood: The neighborhood is beautiful and very well planned out There are many styles of houses with differing floor plans There's a home that is the right size for anyone My parents have a single story with a basement that is perfect for entertaining while my wife and I have a small two-story cottage that is the perfect starter home for us Agritopia boasts the smallest two-way streets in the Valley to help promote pedestrian walkways and reduce the heat island effect within the neighborhood Given the narrow streets all homes are equipped with emergency sprinkler systems reducing homeowner's insurance There is also a nice community center that is optimal for hosting small events (my wife and I had a wedding shower there and the community has neighborhood events throughout the year) Not to mention the fitness room with workout equipment and a nice pool that is even heated in the winter months The beautiful homes have front doors that face each other and promote social activity in front of the homes with neighbors This is the optimal way to get to know who lives near you and build lasting relationships which promotes a true sense of community Attractions: Keeping with the sense that this land was once a farm lives on for those in the neighborhood There is a community garden where residents can have their own plot of land to plant grow and harvest their own crops (Also promoting sustainability) There is also a commercial farm which supplies produce to the nearby Joe's Farm Grill and Liberty Market Joe's Farm Grill is the popular restaurant built from the Johnston's old home You may have seen them on Diners Drive-Ins and Dives This is a great lunch spot Also there is The Coffee Shop Located in an old tractor covering this coffee house has specialty espresso drinks and pastries Jessica Cuff owner was on Cupcake Wars and took home 1st place for her delicious treats The farm at Agritopia has a farm stand where the fresh local organic produce is available for purchase at extremely reasonable pricesKeep an eye out for this becoming THE PLACE to be in Arizona Plans for an assisted living development are in the works to break ground this spring/summer Also the commercial corner (named the EpiCenter) is in planning stages This will bring artisan products and establishments to the corner promoting local businesses walkability and gourmet food/drink."
3330,0,"I never thought I'd be leaving a review for a grocery store but last night's experience at the deli was so God-awful I had to pick up a few items for the house and suddenly craved fried chicken Rather than going to nasty KFC I decided to pick some up from their deliThe lady who takes your order is rude She was talking to a co-worker while I was waiting to place my order and didn't stop talking to said co-worker until I said ""excuse me - should I come back""Then I ordered the 8 piece (for me and the family) with two sides The sides aren't listed on the menu so I asked her what the sides were She proceeded to (without even looking at me) point to the right and said ""there""The sides were terrible The mac n cheese was almost gone No mashed potatoes I was left with seafood salad and coleslaw I take everything home and was so livid when I took the first bite of chicken There was NO CHICKEN on the inside How is that even possible It was just burnt skin I would have been better off at KFC."
4511,0,"The last time I came to this place was over 5 years ago and they had good food and good service HOWEVER today was a different story I wanted to take my best friend here for breakfast and here is how it wentactually it didnt go anywherewe walked in and were greeted by a young man when 2 seconds later sam came over and they ignored us and started bickering in front of us Then i told the guy we wanted to sit outside and he had to ask same which i didnt understand why considering the restaurant was nearly empty As we were waiting for him to return another waitress asked if we were being helped and at the point same and the guy were walking back to us bickering Finally we were being taken to the outside seating area when I heard sam mutter something So rude When we were finally seated the table was dirty WTF it wasnt busy so i dont get WHY they had any dirty tables So the guy who seated us was gonna go get a bus boy to clean it we waited for about 10 minutes when tito came and questioned my english First off I dont want to be greeted with ""YO"" I am not your homeboy second there wasnt enough people for us to be called ""y'all"" It was annoying so when we told him NO we arent ready to order because our table wasnt cleaned off he told us he was gonna go get someone else to do it At that point we were irritated and just got up and left Looking at most of these reviews I dont understand why management doesnt fix this service issue All you have to do is hire servers that have high school diplomas and BAM problem solved."
2063,0,"I've been going here for many years Actually since well before the new owner(s) came in and renamed it Stray Cat For a long time I really enjoyed the drink and dinner specialsI've noticed the food service sliding down hill quickly this year Earlier this year I brought some of my visiting family to the business because the food and service had been so awesome to that point For some reason they had a useless cook working that day who burnt everything he sent out to us  twice The owner on site was so embarrassed after we showed him what was served he offered us gift cards to cover our food My family vowed never to return I figured it was a fluke and was impressed that the owner acknowledged the problem and did something to address itIn June I went in on a Monday and ordered a basket of chicken wings To my surprise they were completely out of wings I ended up going elsewhere to eat that night and sent Stray Cat a private message on their Facebook account letting them know what happened A month to the day I received a response ""That was a busy weekend for us We never want to let a loyal customer down Hope you'll be back to 'Fix' your wing cravings soon""In August I went in on a Sunday and again ordered a basket of chicken wings I was stunned because they again were completely out of wings I sent a followup message to Stray Cat via Facebook letting them know of the pattern and advising they should speak with whomever is doing the product ordering Their ENTIRE response:      ""Maybe eat wings on Friday or Saturday when we're fully stocked""WOW I immediately went to the bar and requested to speak to the owner who had ironically ""just left"" I gave a printout of the messages sent back and forth to a server who knows me well told her what happened and asked to have the owner contact me No contact what so everIf this is how they treat a longtime patron now imagine what this place is headed for Save your money for a business that actually cares about the people bringing cash through the door That snarky message was it for me I'm done."

3931,0,"First I will say that I have been a regular patron of this hotel in the past For my most recent experience I was treated with extreme disrespect and disregard despite the fact I have chosen this hotel in the past It was a Saturday night and my girlfriend and I had returned from a night out on Mill Ave Things turned intimate on the bed but noise levels were well within reason We inadvertently left the curtains open on a second floor room facing the courtyard We finished our activities and got up to get dressed and saw a security guard running across the courtyard screaming at the top of her lungs to close the curtains Surprised and embarrassed we immediately closed the curtains and sunk into bed to go to sleep The security guard comes upstairs and pounds on our door demanding we open up As we were tired and not dressed and now that the curtains have been fully closed we attempted to drift asleep This only lasted a short while until our door was pounded on by the police The property was asking us to leave For what We had to pay a taxi to take us to another hotel and pay for alternative accommodations At least this hotel was hospitable to us We kindly requested a refund from Mission Palms as we were not able to stay the whole night that we rightfully paid for It took three weeks for the management here to even respond and we were denied this request  Couples and anyone else who plans on doing what this hotel thinks of as ""indiscriminate activities"" in the supposed privacy of the room you pay for BEWARE Stay elsewhere."
265,1,Awesome idea  We stumbled across this gem while we were next door at the wine bar  We saw a couple drinking a six pack at the grocery store's outdoor seating and thought - we're so there  Not only is it a quaint local grocery store but they also serve breakfast lunch and dinner  Their baked goods from breakfast to desserts all looked delicious and unique  We tried their pizza - which was very good - light crust and not super oily  We also shared their hostess like cupcake - so good  And of course beer  I'd love to come back for breakfast as their english muffins are fresh and to die for.
2848,1,Dr Stewart and her staff were wonderful with my 14 yr old shih tzu who went in for his first teeth cleaning and then 5 extractions  Their professionalism and friendly staff put me at ease for this procedure and my little guy did great  From the super clean facility to the compassion from everyone I knew that he was in good hands  Thank you again for putting my worries at ease and giving me more healthy years with our beloved KC.
36,1,Decided to switch up my usual location Never had it before with past owners but food was fresh and flavours were amazing A little pricy but worth the extra penny.

60,1,I came away from my meal (complete with cocktail + dessert) with no guilt Local fresh tasty and healthy cuisine here For the first round order the fig tart I'm a sucker for ahi sashimi and this salad had some homemade pickles that were just out of this world I didn't miss the fact that there was no dressing on the salad Almond Olive Oil Cake made me curious and while it was tasty I will be getting the Lemon Tart next time.

1987,1,This is our new favorite place The food and drinks are great  On our first visit they gave us a card for a free appetizer or dessert So we went back on Sunday 8/12 and on top of the free appetizer we were given a manager discount of 20% off My fiance loved the tortilla soup I loved the cheeseburger on brioche bun The salads are innovative Can't wait to go back.
3093,0,Since the changed menu yuk Will not return.
759,1,Don't let the strip mall setting deter you  This restaurant has some of the best tasting fish in town  When you walk in the servers are very friendly and quick to seat you  They recently expanded so it doesn't feel as cramped as before  The quality of the tuna is the best I've had in town  When you bite down your teeth easily cut through the fish while keeping a good tuna consistency  The prices are not inflated like your typical Scottsdale sushi restaurant  They even have appetizer specials where you buy a bottle of Kirin and you get a choice of 6 appetizers for only $50  I highly recommend this place to any fan of great sushi with equal service.
2482,1,I absolutely love Chompies It's the closest thing to a New York style deli that I have found in Phoenix They have a very large and extensive menu and everything I've ordered has been really goodThey also have an amazing bakery that offers a very large assortment of tasty treats such as black and white cookies red velvet cake enormous éclairs napoleons and New York style cheese cakeI'd say that my favorite thing on the menu is the pastrami sandwich although I recently tried the Jewish Sliders after seeing them on Man vs Food The sliders were really good unlike any slider I have ever had The challah bread and potato pancake gave these sliders a very unique flavor very tasty I also tried the Western Sliders and those are good as well Although I live closer to their new location in Chandler I still go to the Tempe location because of the hot ASU waitressesChompies is the best.

3798,0,I was looking forward to checking this place out after reading the reviews on Yelp  It's decorated in a beach theme and seems like a fun atmosphereI sat at the bar and it took a little while to get my menu  I ordered the bacon cheeseburgerAnd then I waited  And I waited  A half hour after I sat down at the bar I still didn't have any food  I put a couple bucks on the bar for my Sprite and walked out.
3112,0,I went off the grid and ordered something they are possibly not known for the chicken ceasar wrap  I was insulted by what I got for paying I believe 6 dollars for  When I looked inside of it their may have been the collection of a small chicken leg as far as the portion of meat it did not exist  The entire thing was stuffed with iced berg lettuce  The cost of this piece of crap may have been a dollar a mark up up 5 dollars thanks  I left hungry and unsatisfied never again  QT and grocery stores have better wraps then this place and far less cheaper.

52,1,Setting:  We either go before or after church  If we get there early there is definitely more of a selection although we have hit the gem going in the afternoon before they close on SundaysAmbiance:  I would like to say I am somewhat of a donut connoisseur  These deep fried goodness is definitely my weakness  Once you enter you are filled with the smell ofyup you guessed it donuts  They have a great selection a little bar to sit at seating outside and tables inside as wellFood/Menu:  The maple bars are my favorite  They are soft topped off with the right amount of maple and fluffy donuts  They also have small apple fritters that are deep fried on the outside that makes the crunch even more delicious  These are definitely my two favorite donuts but the rest I have tried have great quality and tasteService:  This place is family owned with friendly service  I have not had any problems with serviceOverall:  Well organized and clean compared to other donut places  I am about to drop some knowledge on you Arizonians: the donuts are fresh and they are THE BEST DONUT PLACE I have had in the Phoenix area  If they had healthy donuts I would be here every day  However I will stick to the occasion of 1 or 2 times a month before or after church  We will see you again Rainbow Donut goodness.
3789,0,Now i recall why I haven't been here in so long: WAY over inflated prices  I got lured in with discount  cut-outs in mags coupons mailers - all in 1 mth so I thought hey why not take advanage of some money saving opportunity  Laura's (amazing) goat cheese was DOUBLE what you can purchase in Fresh & Easy (exaxct same amount & packaging $6 vs $3 - about a glof ball sz amount)  Did i mention all the moldy pitas in the bread section (Ewww)  Oh bought wine um the $60 kind - it was OFF  (when the cork almost falls out of the bottle dry clean there is your 1st clue)  The wine & liqours where so over-inflated it was unbelievable: ie: grey goose for $35 (always around $10 less at places like safeway & albertson's)  The high end wines (duck horn ect) 25% or more less at Phoenix Wine Also  I saw about only 5% of their wine that were actually on saleAt check out our discount was incorrect - we only saw in the car  Went back in for adjustment realized still incorrect After 3 tries they finally gave us the correct discount amount off $200 purchaseWill I be back  Even with several major discount coupons I could still use no way do I have any desire to return to this uppity over-priced estabishment.
4874,0,Totally bummed that when I ordered TOFU and VEGGIES it came out cooked in chicken broth  I'm sure it is my fault and I should have specified that I was a vegetarian but I thought that was implied from the conversation I had with the waitress and by the order  I don't know any meat eaters (though I am SURE they exist) that order tofu & veggies when they go out to dinner  I sent my food back and left  :(.
405,1,I am still thinking about the gnocci I had at Circa 1900 back in July Any dinner that remains deliciously vivid in my memory for four months has got to be worthy of five starsI had a great time with one of my good friends We were excited to see they used Effen vodka to make their martinis and had a great blackberry cosmo I was afraid it would be too fruity for me but it was fabulousI had a fresh tomato salad - perfect for the Arizona summer - and a very light gnocci dish with a delicate broth and mushrooms We didn't get a chance to have dessert because we were running to a movie - Another great thing about Circa 1900 is its location We were able to walk to the Arizona Center to catch our movie and then rounded out our evening with some ice-cream at Cold Stone.
4082,0,"I went here with a group of friends thinking it would be a fun night out We mostly went for bowling so we got Winter Fun Passes since it included ""unlimited"" bowling plus billiards gravity ropes etc To get a bowling lane we had to wait an hour and to use the gravity ropes we had to wait a half hour No big deal We reserved one lane since there were 6 of us bowling (in a group of 8) They neglected to tell us that there was a one-hour time limit on the lanes When we realized this about a half hour into our game and went to reserve another lane the lady laughed at me and said that there were 30 groups ahead of us I asked if she could give me an estimate of how long the wait would be and her reply was ""A long time"" When I stood there staring at her she finally said ""It'll be at least a two-hour wait"" We tried checking out the billiards while we waited again but the 6-8 pool tables they had were full and every employee had a different answer about how to reserve one One of them asked to hold one of our credit cards I don't think so So for the over $100 spent between the 6 of us (not including what we spent on arcade games while we waited) we got one round of bowling and one round of gravity ropes before we got tired of waiting and left That would have bought about 3 games for our entire group at AMF Very disappointing This was SO not worth it and none of us plan on coming back."

804,1,Fun dog-friendly brunch spot with nice patio (they even have a dog menu) Service was friendly It was a little slow to get a table and get our food but we were a large group on a Saturday morning Lots of healthy and not so healthy options It's definitely the kind of place where everyone in your group can find something they like.

1323,1,Farrelli's Cinema Supper Club is exactly what the name would imply a place to have dinner/drinks while eating dinner The unspoken part is that it is FUNManagement requests that you make reservations and it helps to secure a good seat You place your order before the movie starts and receive your food during the previews The staff is helpful and operates very quietly throughout the film The movies are second-run During a recent newsletter ownership explained that the market power of the multiplex (Harkin's) prevents them from getting the first run movies The selection is good They generally show 4-6 movies and I have seen Casino Royale Blades of Glory POTC: Black Pearl and Spiderman III there The food is good but a little pricey I always order the Chicken Farrelli (chicken artichokes potatoes) which is phenomenal The menu includes appewtizers salads burgers sandwiches and entreesFor something a little different and BETTER than the multiplex try Farrelli's.

528,1,We'll definitely be back Very comfortable nice restaurant without being fancy There were two teenagers and three adults in our group and they seated us at one of their very large booths You could probably fit eight smaller people into one of them Good startWaitress was very nice and patient and happy to explain and recommend items We were all very happy with what we received We'll definitely be back the next time we're in Case Grande.

4416,0,Food quality has gone way downI used to come here frequently and really liked the Pho  Unfortunately the last two times I went the food was awful  The meat quality was really poor  The taste was not the same  There was a lot of fat  One time the meat looked weird maybe overcooked and I felt ill after eating  I gave the place one more shot and it was still bad  I won't be back until I know the quality is back to what it used to be  :(.
4531,0,"I arrived at this Taco Bell at noon   Placed my order at 12:13pm and got my food at 12:33  I came to try the new cool ranch taco and received  regular Doritos taco   When I tried to tell the man (he looked like the manager) who have me my food he said ""this looks like yours""  I said ""I ordered the cool ranch taco box""  He replied ""you want a box""  I said forget it and walked away When I sat down to eat my food it seemed as though it had been sitting for awhile  The bottoms of the tacos were soggy and falling apart and the food was cold  Don't get me wrong I have realistic expectations for fast food at Taco Bell but this was pretty horrible even by those standards."
3592,0,After all the great reviews I thought the food would be great  It wasn't  We both ordered the ribs ith different side orders ( fries beansetc)  The food is greasy   It thrown on a paper plate and served in a sloppy fast food style  We left without eating our plates.
1658,1,Tried Sens this weekend and I'll be back again and again  Ten of us took the big table in the back and ate till we were sick  Everything was outstanding and I don't think we missed any of the Tapas  The New Times said that the spiced Pork on a sugar cane skewer was flavorless but after eating 8 or 9 of these little guys - I'd have to disagree  They were one of my favorites (ok maybe not 8 or 9)Beef Ribs Duck Battered Fish Carpaccio and Tofu were all excellent with LOTS of Sapporo  This place begs for repeat performances.

2463,1,Oh wow this place is awesome  I love everything about it  The other day after a long day at work I got there at closing time (thinking it would still be open)  I tried the door and it was locked and saw the chairs were all set up on the tables etc  I was so sad and started to walk away and a guy there came out and asked me to come in  He said they had only just closed so they were still working on putting the food away and would make me something first  It was so sweet and after a long day of work it just made my day  Their food is so yummy too and all the people that work there have always been so sweet.
146,1,how can you NOT love Costco  I mean you can get almost anything (ok ok yeah sometimes you have to get A LOT of it) at very good pricingThe food court is an excellent deal for a bite to eat  The quality of products and the return policy are great as well.

1008,1,"My dear friend treated me to a Retirement Celebration yesterday and our experience at Seasons 52 was extraordinary  We had the ultimate server- Ken- who was informative about menu choices intuitive about dietary restrictions (my pal is a Vegan) an absolute delight and catered to our every need  We toasted with a lovely bottle of Cava and paired it with a Tomato Flatbread that was crisp and light- perfect for a hot summer day  My friend ordered the delectable Vegetable platter and I selected the special- a Copper River Salmon with corn risotto and asparagus- both recommended by Ken  All I can say is mmmmmmdelish  We couldn't say no to dessert and indulged in the individual Chocolate Peanut Butter Parfait  No matter the ""season""- whether a 115 degree summer day or a crisp fall day- I am sold on Seasons 52  Ask for Ken- he will make sure your dining experience is truly a treat."
530,1,I really had an enjoyable dinner hereThe waiter/owner (I'm guessing) was awesome He was cracking jokes with us and was really fun  So what did we have Now he was the only guy running around in this little restaurant (maybe like 6 or 7 tables) so he was plenty busy Yet he was still pretty attentive of our table The guy was hilarious though definitely made the meal more enjoyableThis is what I remember having (it's has been about 3 weeks since my trip to Arizona):Inca Cola and the columbian pop as well I split half a can of each with my brother Not too bad both were kind of too sweet for meThe Tamale Sampler platter:a red green and Ecuadorian tamale The Ecuadorian tamale was really tasty The pork and vegetable combination in that tamale really went together well The others were Mexican style which I felt were good but readily available at other restaurantsThe Queen Arepa was delicious Definitely worth a tryThere was a shrimp dish that was kind of like a gumbo I wish I remembered what it was called Did not disappointLastly we had some sort of fish dish in a banana leaf I didn't really like the flavoring of the fish I guess it was just an odd mix of spices that I didn't find too appealing All in all a really awesome meal even though I wasn't a fan of the fish I would definitely go back whenever I'm in Phoenix.
3613,0,Disgusting Don't expect customer service Don't expect employees to stop their personal conversations with each otherDon't expect employees to look you in the eye as you are paying for an item Don't expect employees to have manners not even the most basic mannersDo expect to have employees ignore you as you are paying for an item at the registerExpect employees to stand in an isle yelling rules that will never pertain to a self respecting customerGoing to Last Chance would be less painful if the employees had an ounce of class  Buying a used $600 purse is already a cockamamie idea But to have the sales person be outright rude to you as you pay for that bag or any other item for that manner is just beyond ridiculous Used crap is clearly worth much less than new merchandise Last Chance should be so lucky to accept money for the used crap people return to Nordstrom After my terrible experience at Last Chance I would rather save my money and deal with polite and classy sales people to purchase necessary items at a higher priceNordstrom I am very disappointed in you Your employees should provide the same level of customer service at all locations that represent the Nordstrom name.
1823,1,Holy Delicious Food Batman Headed over to Grassroots on a whim while in town Stopped in on a Tuesday with the Husband and kids (13 & 8 - both kids are super adventurous eaters so I had no worries) It was busy but they got us in on a high top in the bar I know I'm going to love a place when the menu starts to blur because every single thing looks amazing We started with the Pork Belly (my husbands favorite food on the planet) Pork Belly with candied prosciutto  It was probably one of the best things I have ever eaten Could have stopped there and been perfectly happybut whyWe ordered short ribs (husband) shrimp and grits (me) seared ahi (Big) and chicken with hearts of romaine (Little) All of them were absolutely spectacular The short ribs were melty and delicious and fabulous The BBQ sauce was heavenly and the meat was ridiculously tender The shrimp and grits were nothing short of amazing I could have just done the bowl of jalapeño cheese grits on its own without the shrimp  The Ahi was Devine The agave ponzu was sweet and delicious and I'd like a bottle of it to use at home Or to drink whichever The hearts of romaine was yummy and Little cleaned her plate We finished off the meal (already stuffed) with a banana split that was creamy gelato topped with candied pecans Just yummy and wonderfulCan't wait to get back to Scottsdale to enjoy this place again Just a GREAT GREAT meal.

538,0,"We've had slow service and not so great service before but nothing as bad as today  We were in the bar area for 9 minutes and nobody acknowledged us (there were 2 tables and about 6 guys drinking @ the bar) so we walked into the dining area thinking that would be better  We waited another 8 minutes2 waiters CLEARLY saw us and didn't say a word and had 2 small tables  Finally we got up to leave and my husband asked one of them why the service was so bad  His excuse was ""we don't have a hostess today""  What does that matter   Then he asked to speak to a managerguess what   They have no manager either  The guy never apologized or took any responsibility  He only said ""well I can wait on you now"" We will never ever ever waste our money here again  Not when there are so many other pizza and wing places nearby."
4581,0,Awful - I can not say do not go enough how bad this place is - I am a bleeding heart and have given it 5 chances   I can only hope that is closes and is replaced but a restaurant that knows what it is doing - anything at this point would be better  Please put this - poor service unacceptable- whatever it is out of business  The food looks as if it has sat for days in the sun the service is beyond awful and the people just do not seem to care  I almost want to stop people from walking in I feel so bad when I see them heading there  I live within walking distance and would love a cute wine bar cafe or a mini AJ's there - PLEASE- end this awful place.

3927,0,"This place manages to have worse customer service than both the MVD and Walmart which is pretty impressiveThe lack of customer service coupled with world class apathy- makes me cringe My experience has truly astonishing and I look forward to finding a different provider ASAPLong story short I need routine respiratory supplies and they are supposed to be mailed on a quarterly basis For some reason in June I didn't get my supplies but being super busy and working 60-80 hours a week I didn't have time to call them Flash forward to Sept (give or take) and I called asking where my items were I was told that there was a computer glitch and my new address wasn't the one being used for mailing No problem things happen- they said they would fix it and send over what I neededFast forward to October and I still don't have the stuff I continue to make do with my old stuff and then remember to call Valley Respiratory and ask what's up The person there was nice and said that she didn't know why I didn't get my order it was never shipped- but she would send it out I never got that shipment either but with the busy holidays I didn't get a chance to call until Nov/Dec I again spoke with an employee who said she would mail it out and also let me know that in Jan I would start receiving my stuff three months worth at a time I never received anything until the end of Dec when I got the three months supply that is for Jan-March I have no idea what happened from June-Dec but eight months passed without supplies and all the while my insurance company was being billed and they paid for supplies I never receivedI called today and spoke with a nice RT who put me on hold and a new person whom I presume was a supervisor spoke with me This person was very condescending and essentially shit all over me It's worth noting that I am very laid back and I don't get upset or yell or any other douchey behavior I can't help but see that people who tantrum get more when they encounter these situations but that's not me so I tried to explain what happened and asked her to mail me my supplies that were still missing since June This woman was clearly annoyed and said that I should have called them and told them about the problem I reminded her that I had called several times since June and was still waiting The woman told me that ""normal people"" call sooner and that I had a month from the time they were supposed to ship it to call and advise them that I never got the package I am unsure how I am supposed to know when they are sending me things when  they are eight months late in sending me my last supplies Perhaps I should employ a psychic I asked her how they could bill my insurance for things that I never receive and she essentially said that they don't know I didn't receive them So now I am a liar too which is nice  All in all I don't think you should have to micro-manage a company who is supposed to have their act together Mistakes will happen and that's ok but when a mistake does happen don't treat your customers like shit and tell them that they are doing it all wrong The bigger issue is that when I am telling them I never received the shipment I am told that it must have been stolen I told her that since I hadn't received my supplies in 8 months a more likely scenario is that they never sent it but she said that it had been sent So miraculously all my Amazoncom packages were safe from the roving thieves pillaging my neighborhood but a small light box from them was stolen Uhh ok- that makes senseTo recap it's forgivable to mess up shipping something but it is unforgivable to treat a customer so poorly and to bill for items that were never shipped or received I highly recommend you go elsewhere save yourself headaches time and energy."

2496,1,Great food Wonderful patio And amazing company I am so glad they have only relocated because this is a treasure in a sea of junk:) The food is quite delicious and I cannot tell you how good the caprese pizza was It is more than enough to share Love love love the pesto base topped with fresh mozzarella and sliced tomatoes The crust was light and fresh Really enjoyed the citrus mint iced tea and to top off the meal I enjoyed the no bake chocolate and peanut butter cookies soy free of course This place is so amazing and I love the little changes they made since relocating downtown Did I tell you I had great company for lunch Thanks Michael.

4765,0,Okay food terrible slow and arrogant service  You guys need to change your attitude  The server could have cared less about her service ignored us and the food took forever Not even an acknolwedgement from the staff that the food was taking too long Also we were sat down about 15 to 30 min after our seating time and there was not enough space for us to sit to wait for our table as there are only 4 chairs - 2 back to back so I had to sit on the edge as there were several of us After asking to get a drink a waitress shoved a menu in my face and said she would take my order and never came around We also had to chase our check down as well.
545,1,I LOVE TOTAL WINE I come here often when I need to stock up on my favorite kinds of liquor - the prices are pretty good and the selection is so vast that I always end up buying more than I wanted to Another good thing is that people don't give you dirty looks if they happen to see 3 or 4 or 5 bottles of alcohol in your hands :p In fact they might look at it as a good thing One thing I really like are mini bottles of alcohol that they have SO CUTE.

3661,0,I have used this shop for a few years but I have to admit I am not happy with their service right now I had a Hayward vacuum that they fixed twice under warranty and the same thing broke again - instead of perhaps considering I just got a bad vacuum I was told I had excessive use Really - how exactly does one use a pool vacuum too much  I don't run it 24/7 its a small play pool and the vacuum is less than 2 years old  Now they want me to pay over $200 and to be honest they weren't very nice about it either  I don't think I will go back here.
1595,1,great selection but the shopping center can get crowded at peak times.
1222,1,Excellent food excellent service and a very short walk from the light rail make this a perfect place for dinner  It's a small place so larger groups may have to wait a little longer than a traditional restaurant but the food is worth it and the wait staff is excellent.
2546,1,This is a tiny grab and go version of the delicious locally owned Dilly's Delis around the valley  Of course it is no where near the menu of the actual restaurants they have outside of the airport but obviously that is because it is a Kiosk in an airport  The wraps are delicious and better than most of the larger restaurants in the airport by far in my opinion  If you are wanting the yummy soups in homemade bread bowls you will have to drive the 2 miles to University and Hardy Dilly's Deli but you can still get a great ready to go wrap or sandwich in 2 minutes and still make the flight that has started boarding  I am thrilled to see little locally owned shops have made it into the sky harbor airport and hope that people will remember that they are in fact supporting local establishments and not the big chains found at most airports.
3746,0,"We've been going here since it opened several years ago and it keeps getting worse Food is good not great Service has never been good here but it seems to get worse each time we come back The woman who manages or owns the place never even acknowledges us She looks at us each time we come in like she has never seen us before She seems to have no problem bs'ing with the other patrons but ignores us Not that we really want to chit chat with her but a polite ""hello welcome back"" would be nice They have raised the wine prices to the point of most high end restaurants They have also taken ingredients out of there food For example the louisiana po'boy used to includechicken breast shrimp andouille sausage with a choice of red beans and rice or gumbo Now it only comes with the chicken no shrimp or andouille sausage The andouille is available at extra cost You no longer have a choice of the red beans & rice or the gumbo only fries The only reason we are still going here is that we previously purchased some discount coupons We have two coupons left to use and that will be our final dining experience hereAlso beware if you are going here for the first time as their online menu is old and not updated."
1192,1,I've been going here for years Great drink prices and always something to do What it lacks in class it makes up in charm.
2231,1,I couldn't agree less with the first review  I have been a member of a Fill-A-Seat as well as a member of HouseSeats  In the 9 months I have been a member of Fill-A-Seat I have received twelve tickets to some amazing performances in theater symphony and vocal groups  There have been a lot of other offerings that were of interest to me but I have an extremely full schedule  The customer service is wonderful unlike my other subscription  It is very important to check in often and remember that summer is the slow season in Phoenix  At times there have been up to 10 different events offered  Yes there are comedy clubs offered but lots of other stuff too  My other subscription usually says nothing available  So be flexible be adventurous try something new and enjoy Fill-A-Seat.

3681,0,Down hillThis place used to be great but now rests on its laurelsI remember a visit to Mastro' s used to mean perfection now it is just pretentiousI have been several times and always loved it but my last couple of visits have landed this place right in the toilet for me I don't think I will be giving it another visit after this latest episode:I took my dad and family for a birthday celebration because my dad just loved the place too We were greeted and asked about the special occasion by our server who took the opportunity to make jokes about age  All fine Took the drink order for a table of 4 and shows up with 3 drinks but totally forgot the guest of honor's  Oops  Takes our order and serves guest of honor with a barely cooked filet It was ordered medium-rare something Mastro usually nails it came out purple and raw in the middle  When commented on the server promptly picked it back up returned it to the kitchen and brought it back well passed medium Yikes Pay that much for a filet you should expect perfection they missed this one on both sides Not even a question whether it was okay To kick the final door in the table next to us was brought a nice birthday cake and birthday wish we were brought the bill Ouch I suppose being chided about age was gift enoughI was upset enough to write a letter I was very happy to get a voice message from the manager saying he'd like to discuss my experience I called him back and left a message but did not hear back I tried again and have still not heard back for over 6 months Looks like I'm done with this place.
1793,0,"Don't waste your time Cost might be low but they do not stand behind their products Spoke with the owner about a verbally abusive employee that lied about their products He would not do anything to fix the problem but sell me something else The owner asked me if I was handicapped because I can't plan a tree Who asks a customer that This is the most unethical company I have ever worked with I have never been more disappointed by the way I have been treated as a customer Watch out for this company Make sure you get everything in writing and don't believe what anyone tells you there Even if you talk to the owner he will stand behind his employees that can do no wrong and not remedy the lies that have been told What a horrible experience and shame that this company calls themselves a ""family business"" More like a big corporate machine that doesn't care about their customers."
2525,1,I am so impressed I thought everything out here was just strip malls and chains It made finding the place a little difficult I didn't expect one large free standing building surrounded by desert trees and picnic tablesI walked in and was even more impressed This place had options The coffee shop is simply under the same roof as an olive mill In one corner there are outstanding breakfast and sandwich options gelato and pizza in another and locally pressed olive oil sold in the centerThe coffee was great and the ambiance superb.
4797,0,Have been looking for a good handyman for sometime and unfortunately I'll have to keep looking We needed three new sinks installed and Mr Fix it was not happy that there were other trades working in the house mad that he'd have to get some supplies and unwilling to work past four Besides he was rude to my girlfriend I fired them and am getting someone else.
3796,0,"As a loyal (former) patron of Harvey's Wineburger for over 40 years I can now announce that the change of ownership in the past year or so has murdered the magnet that kept customers coming back - their hamburgers  A good friend was in Harvey's in the past month and ask me to go there with him today  He said on his previous visit he got a lousy hamburger and suspected something had changed  His assessment was quite accurateThe first thing you notice when the burger is delivered is that the bun has shrunk and that the burger patty has become perfectly round as compared to its 'jagged' predecessor and flattened - maybe pre-formed and frozen  The first bite discloses the sad news:  the meat is tasteless rubbery and absolutely nothing like the burger that has kept the joint in business 40-plus years  Astonishingly you can no longer taste any hint of wine in the burger  My guess is that the rubbery consistency of the meat (they OBVIOUSLY have changed their supplier and/or grade) rejects the wine poured on it like water on Bullfrog sunscreen    We had heard about the ownership change several months ago with someone commenting that ""oriental owners"" had taken over  The smaller microwaved-tasting bun and the Birkenstock meat are clear signs the new ownership has resorted to use of cheap ingredients - specifically the meat - the landmark's staple - to squeeze more profits while raising prices that are unrecognizable to Harvey's regulars  It's quite sad  This was one of my favorite places in Phoenix - a wineburger and a game of pool - never crowded - that old dive charmand hands down in the top 5 best burgers in town  Apparently the new owner(s) believe all they need is a 40-year reputation  Good luck with that I won't be back."
2267,1,Whenever I am craving a Runza (a favorite food from my hometown of  Lincoln NE) this place takes care of it They have a wide variety of fillings anywhere from lamb to a wonderful vegetarian selection  I've been to both locations and they have always been very consistentFYI Runzas are also known as Bierocks of German origin  (savory filling of meat onion and cabbage).
3654,0,The pizza: total bullocks Tasteless crust is gross toppings are suspect Pasta: not great tastes like it is all from a can WAY too pricey baked zitti will cost $750 for a pretty small amount Give me a break Sandwiches: CRAP I mean really bad Bread is nasty and the meats are sub-par Veggies are nasty as wellBreakfast burritos: actually really good.

390,1,We read about Giant Coffee from Phoenix Magazine and I tried it on a whim I was not disappointed The honey vanilla latte in particular was very good as was the cherry almond scone Prices were good.
3257,0,Martie is horrible and mean stay awayReally bad customer service and just flat out mean Especially Martie the owner.
3466,0,Worst Best Buy everI just had an employee there throw a temper tandrum because I asked him to call someone who has keys to the mobile locker over so I can buy my item  Treating customers like crap just because someone asks if they can buy somethingMethinks not  Never again  NEVER again.
2410,1,Cowboy chow is great Been here a dozen times at least and always pleased with food and service  Order the scallops on risotto and as an entree you can't go wrong with the puerco lento fall of the bone pork served on well seasoned potatoes.
4205,0,I have tried to eat here off and on for the 8 years I've lived here NONE OF THEM WERE FULL ACCLOMPISHED TRIPS I tried to order something just on the 4th of July They weren't all that busy so I walked in and sat at the bar next to the TO GO register I was in a hurry to get back to work because I only have 30 minutes for lunch I was greeted by a hefty young man and was told someone will be with me shortly Ten minutes come and go and the same large waitress walks past me 4 times without a hello and I can't seem to find the young man on top of this the very freakie store manager is behind the counter helping prepare orders which are flying off the counter fast The manager looks at me often and never does anything but stare at me like a creepy old perv 4 very loud women run in to the opposite side of the counter and the large waitress tells them hello and they quickly place an order for fries and onion rings Shortly after the 4 women pay for their order the large girl walks away like I wasn't sitting there with a menu and waiting for *someone*This place can go to hell I'm just going to act like this place never existed and warn others to do the same.
2007,1,good pizza good service.
1634,1,One of the best breakfast joints in the valley.
2486,1,"Usually I go to StarbucksGoing here made me kinda hate Starbucks nowThese peeps have urgency style and flair The girl who comes out to take your order is walking super fast  When we get to the window after the 4 cars in front we had literally been in line 1 minute  At Starbucks this would have easily been 800 minutes  The window: seriously how nice is the guy asking us what we are up to today and including us in the timing ""your carmelizer is coming right up""  Once we got our drinks 20 seconds later we like kinda felt bad leaving our new best friendsThe coffee: nonfat carmelizer for me- yummyDutch latte for him: not a fanBut my hunny said he liked my drinkI still say 5 stars because of the fact these people look like they love what they do  So nice to see."
676,0,I just got back from from lunch at the Scottsdale location My girlfriend and I have had questionable service there before and had previously said that we were not going to again visit the establishment But today all I wanted was to have a sunbru relax and eat The hostess sat us down which to me it seemed like we were inconveniencing her conversation with the bus boy Then it seriously took the server 5 minutes to come to our table and ask us what we wanted to drink I had to ask her to bring us glasses of water I wanted to walk out but my girl insisted we stay now that we were there The server was attentive and pleasant and I began to relax Then i noticed the hostess walk behind the bar with her pepsi cup grab a bottle of whiskey and continue to pour herself a drink This seriously fired me up It seems I have more pride in the brand than she does I have been a patron of Four Peaks since I moved to AZ 11 years ago I've had parties at the Tempe location friends of mine have had baby showers there and it bums me out to see how drastically things have changed I support LOCAL as much as possible but today's episode only serves me to explore my other optionsI'll be heading to Chandler to check out SAN TAN Brewery or I will go Nimbus Bistrobums me out.
1337,1,I love the Mongolian beef with noodles & have getting here for years I was glad to see no Arpaio in sight & the doors back open My wife loves the Dan Dan noodles & the kids get honey seared chicken I stop in this crazy busy location only when I'm in the area because the parking lot is insane I think the concept is great & the service is always quick Consistency is the key to this place.
2064,1,I was at a business meeting at a Starbucks in Scottsdale one afternoon and I smelled something wonderful I couldn't keep my mind on the business deal because of the aroma of some very delicious food Whatever they were saying was not even important I could only think where was that food smell coming from The meeting was finally over no doubt rushed along by me and I walked to a little eating place a couple of doors down I peeked in looked at the menu then cancelled my plans that night and came to a place that would become a favorite I still get a little tear when I remember my first ossobuco there Veneto Trattoria reminds me of the small friendly little places that I have been to in Venice where the food and the ambiance combine together for a memorable experience I have been there many times--alone with family with friends with business associates--and each time has been wonderful Last night It was a little cold outside so I had the gnocci to warm me up The plump potato dumplings tasted homemade and the meat sauce was delicious One of my buddies had my all time favorite Veneto Trattoria dish: ossobuco She let me taste hers and like always it was to die for The veal shank and the risotto make a perfect flavor combination Others at the table had the sausages and the pork chops Of course I mooched a taste of those too Mmmm Don't forget to have their salad with walnuts and goat cheese It's not on the menu but they will make it for you if you askHere's a tip: become a regular I go to Scottsdale for business several times a year and Veneto Trattoria is always on my list Whether you travel to Scottsdale or live there you should go to this spot whenever you can Once you've been there twice they will treat you like family.
4856,0,I for one have a general dislike for ALL circle K's Everyone I have ever been to including this one has been filthy with people full of tattoos and piercings and bandaids covering up their hickeys working thereI have nothing against tattoos or piercings but  come on you are working cover that up It always takes forever and their customer service sucks Circle K you need to make some major changes if you want your company not to be overrun by the more customer oriented convenience stores.

2627,0,I was anxious to try this place because I heard such great things but boy was I wrong  I ordered deliveryjust a simple hot dog onion rings and tacos  Not only did they take an hour and a half to deliver the food but then I was lectured because I didn't have cash to tip them (you know because all other delivery places I've ordered from allow to tip on the card you pay with)  She was rude and almost refused to give me the food because I didn't have cash tip  Then when I actually tasted the food I was even more disappointed  The hot dog was ok but the bun tastes like butter so that's pretty much all you can taste  The onion rings were disgusting and we didn't even bother trying the tacos  We went straight to Indulge burgers---better food and better service  Skip this place for sure.

3321,0,"I just got back from lunch at this place today  I've been to many places in the downtown area for lunch (I work in the area) and this was in my opinion by far my worst experience eating lunch at a downtown establishment  We arrived at the restaurant at about 11:50 am  I arrived with my party a group of 5 and nobody else was waiting in line  As the waitress (they don't have any hosts/hostesses) was trying to figure out how to accomodate our group of 5 she seated the group of 2  that came in from behind us  No big deal - that was a more typical number for them to seatAbout a minute later she sat us next to the cash register  Next to us were two ladies who had ordered their food to go and were still waiting  I had overheard one of the ladies comment to the other lady wondering what was taking their food so long  An omen of things to comeWe received water fairly quickly then was given soup before we ordered  The soup was fine compared to similar establishments although it only had tofu in it rather than maybe one or two pieces of chickenWe ordered our food: two orders of drunken noodles one spicy green bean with chicken one ginger chicken with brown rice and I ordered the spicy eggplant with brown rice  Not a complicated order  Especially when considering the menu is simple: they have like 1406 lunch specials and the only difference in price is whether or not you order a different kind of protein  It's cookie cutter generic Thai food  We ordered at around 11:55 amMy group and I are all friends so we were conversing for awhile without thinking about how long it was taking  By about 12:25 pm we were wondering what was going on  I looked over to the table to my right which is a table of 10 right next to the storefront window of the restaurant  A group of 10 people that had been seated after us had already gotten their food and were in the process of paying their checks  I then saw the group of 2 who were seated just before us finishing up their meals as well  Not a good signAt about 12:30 pm I got up from my seat and asked the lady at the cash register if we were going to be getting our meals anytime soon  She asked me where I was seated noticed I came from right around the corner of the register didn't really answer me turned around to some people and started speaking in a different language to either the cooks or the other waitresses  I sat back down and she darted by shortly thereafter saying 5 more minutesNow I was checking my phone constantly  At 12:38 two orders came out: one of the drunken noodles and the spicy green bean with chicken  My two friends began eating as we had already been waiting for so long  Two more orders came out at 12:40: the other drunken noodle and the ginger chicken  I looked to my right: the group of 10 had gotten up and walked out of the restaurant  I then got my dish  Needless to say I was not happyAs we hurriedly scarfed down our food we asked for the check  We noticed that the two dishes that had ordered brown rice received an additional $2 charge when the menu said $1  I immediately darted up from my seat and went to the cashier and notified her of the problem  To her credit she fixed it immediatelyI then started eating my food  Considering I had to wait over 45 minutes for it it was not even all that hot - temperature or spice wise  I bit into several pieces of eggplant that were still cold - like the stirfry hadn't gotten all the freezer burn out of it just quite and now it was just cold instead of frozen  I had also asked for it to be spicy hot and it wasn't even close to even being mild spicy  For a dish that is supposed to be ""spicy eggplant"" and I ordered it hot: well it wasn't particularly authentic Thai spicyWe asked them to split the check five ways by giving the cashier 5 credit cards (which is just the norm for downtown joints these days)  I asked her why our order took so long and why a table that had 10 people seated after us were able to get their food eat and pay before we even received our dishes  The only answer I got was thank you for being patient and that the group of 10 had called in their order  There were no apologies and no credit to our meals offered  It then took them a long time to get us our checksThe service here was ridiculous  Apparently they treat people who call in their orders with more priority than other guests  (And yet many take out orders waited near us) That's not quite a solution for a poorly run restaurant  Nor was the food all that great either  I will not be coming back here and I would advise that anyone else interested in a normal length lunch not even bother either  But if you don't care that your order comes out 45 minutes after you order it during lunch you get overcharged for items you ordered and enjoy subpar non-authentic food well then by all means go ahead and come here."
1976,1,I have over the years bought hundreds of tires from this location for both personal and company truck use  The service is consistant  They don't make a major effort for you to spend more than is necessary for your needs unlike other places I've been  The company is also very good about honoring the warranty they sell on their tires with very few questions asked   I once when in after I had  blown out both  the tires on the left side of my car at once when I swerved to keep from hitting a child  The tires were two weeks old  No questions asked they replaced them for me  I only had to pay the negligible cost of a new warranty for each tireI am also impressed by the fact that you see the same employees here at a later date  In this industry to keep the same employees over time is quite a fete I believeMy only complaint is that during rush hour getting in and out of this location is a challenge   However it is a plus that there are some many places you can go if you don't want to have to sit and wait while you get your tire situation resolved  That's a real plus in itself  I just suggest going in off hours if you can.
4467,0,"I REALLY want to like this place which is why I came back on a Sunday The barista was nice and friendly that isn't so much the problem Here are the problems1 They have been playing the same terrible song for two hours No joke I'm not sure if this is a psych experiment or a cruel joke but either way- holy @$%2 I must have missed the sign saying ""Burn-outs"" welcome & preferred This is the oddest group of people ever During the course of my visit some random guy tried to ""save"" a really nice man who happens to be blind Along with that the man kept yelling to the counter ""Did ya'll forget me"" Answer- yes He ordered breakfast and bacon 40 minutes earlier YikesSo I cannot recommend this spot unless you like torture or you are a psych major and need to study some weirdos Bring your DSM -IV and have a great time."

1640,1,i was  anxiously awaiting the opening of this restaurant- i'm not a vegan or a vegetarian though i do tend to eat that way but i enjoy good food and i really enjoy good diner food we went there at around 1pm on a saturday- they are open from 7am-2pm and it was still relatively busy we were seated right away- the decor is fun and kitschy the service was very good- all of our questions were answered and our server made us feel very comfortable i ordered the reuben- the marble rye was amazing the slaw for the sandwich was both sweet and sour and i definitely couldn't tell the swiss cheese was vegan my friend ordered the coo-coo (') banana pancakes- he couldn't stop raving about them and was very pleased that the side of fruit salad he ordered actually contained different kinds of fruit i'm only sad that i didn't order the eggplant bacon- my boyfriend is now obsessed with it i can't wait to go back to try it  and a piece of their homemade pie.

3331,0,"My last experience at The Breakfast Club will be just that my last  Living downtown I try and support downtown business and frequent establishments within walking distance of my condo  I've had a few positive experiences here and  more than a few negative experiences but my girlfriend likes the place (or she used to anyway) so when she comes downtown for the weekend we make the trek here  The food is average somethings are well done (good Bennies) some you could get just as good or better almost anywhere  I can name at least 5 breakfast places in Phoenix that I feel have better food at a more competitive priceThe drinks used to be what kept me coming back as I felt this place had one of the best Bloody Mary's in town  My last experience here was a total let down and I should have known something was up when our server asked if we wanted ""spicy"" or ""non-spicy"" when we ordered our drinks a question that has never been asked once in the nearly 2 years I've been ordering drinks here  My ""non-spicy"" tasted totally different than anything I've been served there and not in a good way  My girlfriend's ""spicy"" tasted like someone added a pound of horseradish to it  The drinks are also way over priced $10 for a large and $7 for a small I have no problem paying premium price for a premium product but these no longer fit in that category  The staff is what solidified my decision to cross this off the list of places I frequent as I've only read about service this horrible and never actually experienced it myself until now  I'll start off by saying the service at the Downtown Breakfast Club has always been hit or miss with many more misses than hits  Some of the waitstaff has been very good most has been not so good  I'm really not that hard to wait ontake my order bring me my food refill my water check in once to see if everything is OK and you can expect a good tip  To illustrate my last visit here's a timeline:Checked in with hostess for party of 2 was told 20-30 minutes  Waited almost an hour and watched a total lack of control or caring as people would just walk up and seat themselves at the outdoor seating and nothing would be said by the staff  If the outdoor seating is a free for all like sitting at the bar just let me know and I'll seat myselfFinally had a table waited 1005 minutes before our server came over  Luckily we knew what we wanted so we ordered our drinks and food right away  Bloody Mary's took about 15 minutes to get to us and food was another 20-25  Once the food arrived we asked for ketchup which I feel is a fairly simple request and the server said she would be right back with it  Apparently right back to her means 15 minutes and when she appeared with it and we total her to forget about it since we were already 80% done with our food she seemed a bit put off that we would have the audacity to ask for something and not bow at her feet when she got around to getting it to us  Was the food good would you like more water can I get you anything else  Don't ask our server because she wouldn't know not once did anyone stop by our table and ask even one of these basic questions My advise to the owner of this establishment would be kill it with fire  This location is destroying your brand and had I never been to the Scottsdale location I would never have given this one as many chances and I have  I would rather eat stale Fruity Pebbles with month old milk then eat here again."
860,1,Most post offices are the embodiment of government inefficiency Understaffed bleary grumpy workers limited and inconvenient hours zero point zero customer service effort lines fifteen people deep you know the drillThe Van Buren post office is a small gift from God because it's TOTALLY THE OPPOSITE They have extended hours rad for those of us with actual jobs that keep us occupied between 8 am and 5 pm They are always fully staffed with real live smiling helpful people who seem to enjoy their jobs More than once they've helped me figure out a cheaper way to send stuff and have even helped me jam stuff into smaller boxes to save some cash The self-serve kiosk is always fully stocked and functional Plus my local Arcadia location is like a depressing United Nations gathering full of depressed-looking people who appear wasted and/or haven't showered in four days The Van Buren location is usually pretty empty but once there were a couple of teenagers trying to send live chickens through the mail which was pretty awesome.
3422,0,This place leads the list of tourist traps in Old Town Scottsdale  It has all the massed produced junk you'd expect to find at an airport store - t-shirts postcards cactus - with nothing interesting or unique  Save your time and money  It's better spent elsewhere in Scottsdale.

1866,1,"Let me start off by saying THIS WAS THE BEST FAST FOOD EXPERIENCE OF MY LIFE I am appalled (In a good way) So my mother is always going on and on about ""Pollo Campero"" and makes it her mission to take me to lunch there today I've seen this establishment a few times while driving on Thomas Rd but never put much thought into having a meal thereWe arrive at ""Pollo Campero"" and right away the smell makes me savagley hungry Their menu included many sides from ceaser salads to white rice mixed with black beans While seeming like a very much Mexican themed restaurant i was surprised they served ""yucca frita"" and ""platanos fritos"" (fried plantanes) which are traditionally found in Central and South American dishes as well as Carribean dishes Every side dish was nothing like a fast food restaurant the rice and vegtables tasted just like it was home made (amazing) I must emphasize this again THE SIDE DISHES ARE RESTAURANT QUALITY I ordered the ""5 Dollar Meal"" which includes two pieces of chicken (grilled or fried) and two sides  and a dinner roll or tortillas I felt bad about paying so little for such a large and freshly prepared meal The ceaser salad was half of the plate and so crisp and fresh :)Another thing I have never been treated so well at a fast food restaurant in my life Again I cannot emphasize this enough The owner even came out and gave us coupons for our next visit after asking us if there was anything they can do for us The cashier lady walked over to our table to give us crayons and a coloring book for my little nephew When we left the entire staff waved goodbye Now tell me that doesn't sound like a cheesey Pleasantville skit only it's trueThe restaurant was decorated great with different pictures of landscapes on the wall The music was of excellent taste as well mixing different latin music from different regions of Latin American The restaurant was very clean and organized I give this restaurant a full 5 stars and recommend everyone to try it out sometime you will be amazed as well :) I guess this made me officially a ""regular""(Quick recommendation: Opt for the grilled chicken you will never taste chicken the same ever again goodness :) )."

604,1,Apologize to LDM for the mindless review from Lee Chance aka Lee FLee has issues with me calling him out as a hack while attacking a competing business and Lee C has now taken his vendetta to hacking on my reviews of reputable establishments such as LDM   LDM is  a premier New Mexican Cuisine establishment that can and will stand up to the most discerning tastebuds.
2666,1,I've only had the buffets but I'm giving this place 5 stars because it's consistently AMAZING  My boys 5 and 8 ask to eat here  The week buffet doesn't have as large as an assortment as it does on the weekend but the price is less than the weekend  With the food being made fresh and in-house--- the price is well worth it  Great attentive staff as well as friendly  We always feel welcomed and appreciated and WE ALWAYS LEAVE FULL & HAPPYThank you.
559,1,"Went last night (90701) for my first time and can't stop thinking about how impressed I am with both the service and the food A super cool concept atmosphere and menu Our waiter (Kevin who is actually one of the 3 owners) was awesome and extremely personable He suggested the redberry rapture for a drink and it was spectacular (and under 100 calories) We got to talking about vodka and he spoke of a brand I had never heard before and within minutes he brought both my hubby and I a sample of the vodka he was talking about The gesture was great and so was the vodka We started with the pretzel bread delishespecially the tomato dipping jam I had the buffalo chicken wrap and my hubby got a 1/2 of the loaded Mac and Cheese The buffalo wrap was really good and the Mac and Cheese was hands down the best I have ever had I am not a big meat fan so I would probably get it ""naked"" next time but holy cow was it good A 1/2 order is fine for an average sized meal All in all amazing experience I loved the concept of ""owners at your service""the three owners were the waiters from 7-9pm and all of their tips went to charity Awesome I will be back."
256,0,Ok so this review is based strictly on the fact that the parking staff weather contracted or not wasted 45 minutes of our life we will never get back After getting off the freeway and waiting 45 minutes in line to turn into the parking lot they made everyone turn around and leave the parking lot as it was full It would have been nice if they would have posted a sign prior to waiting in the ridiculous long line We won't be back.

1981,0,This place is terrible Staff is slow not familiar with things A couple days ago I came in alone ordered one smoothie The woman proceeded to take the order of the large group behind me before starting to make mine wasted ten minutes there Went back today got a smoothie and flatbread Opened flatbread when I got home took a bite totally smelled like cigarettes In the garbage it went I guess they don't wash hands or wear gloves Won't be back ick.
1546,1,As good a steakhouse as there is Proof that money does buy you the finer things in life This place is on the steep end of the price scale But you know that coming into it The food and service is primeNote: Place is very dark and the noise level can be tremendously loud.
4867,0,I was liking this place but the handle was so hard to push down I did it and it hurt me when it came up  It feels bruised and it almost took me away from eating but wow they need to fix that I don't like it and it's not safe for little kids to be doing that  The yogurt is nice I like all the selections they have and topping are neat too like brownies crushed cookies and marshmallows Staff is nice too but my hand still hurts.
1180,1,"I have been to this store several times over the last few years Sami and his guys are the best  I expected all Sprint Stores to give the same sort of customer service that the guys at Queen Creek & Alma give  Boy was I mistaken  The corporate store at Chandler blvd & price freeway is the extreme oposite of how good the service is at Queen Creek & Alma School    I was ""educated"" on the difference between the 2 stores by 3 employees at the corporate store  They ""corporate store"" should be embarassed at the lack of customer service   I think that the lackluster employees at the corp store need to be ""educated"" by Sami and his staff of how to help a customer."
3563,0,Very disappointed  Spent over an hour with the sales girl paid a  deposit for the Fantasia phone told her we would be back Wednesday to pick them up  So on Wednesday after waiting another 30 or more minutes in the store to talk to our sales girl she told us no phones were available  A good salesperson would have called us and let us know before we made the trip in or told us when she saw us sitting there that the phones were not available  Too bad for her Will never do business with them  They took our money but had no phone  Not good business practice.
1229,1,What started as a single smoothie (post Insanity workout) has turned into a full blown Mojo Bowl addiction From the first time I tried the banana bread smoothie Mojo Bowl is pretty much a daily craving I love the story behind Mojo Bowl and it's creator Scott His passion for healthy and delicious food is apparent with every hand created acai bowl Just watching him prepare my Xena bow was like watching a piece of art being created I can't tell you what is the best smoothie bowl or salad to try because they are all amazing in their own way True story Stop by the yellow food truck at the Phoenix Public Market and say hi to Scott You will leave with a craving for health for life.
3443,0,"This Starbucks is SLIPPINGtwice within 1 week we have left empty handed Stopped in for coffee a couple nights ago and the girl said ""we don't have any"" I thought she was jokingfinally she said ""if you want to wait we can make some"" frustrated by the lazy-faire attitude we left Sunday afternoon @ 1:30 we stopped in for a pound of espresso beans (which we buy once a week at this same location) only to be told ""we're outwe don't have any"" UNBELIEVABLE Are you a coffee store or just a wi fi hot spot Needless to say this is disturbing & what makes it worse is the staff doesn't care in the slightest."
1914,1,I stopped in their last night right before I hit up the Jamie Foxx concert at the Dodge Theater It's a cute little place Very clean and quite quiet on a Thursday evening But then again it was technically after hours (7pm) in the downtown area so unless major is going on it just may be like this all the time The guy that took care of me was really sweet I wish I would have gotten his name He was patient as I was trying to decide on the only slice of pizza I wanted LOL In the end I choose a huge slice of piping hot pepperoni and for under $300 for my slice not to shabby I sat myself down and watched some of the college football game and enjoyed my wonderfully delicious slice of pepperoni pizza I swear their was pepperoni in ever bite It wasn't greasy and the crust was just perfect He even checked up on me to make sure I didn't want a second slice My mind was screaming YES YES but alas I was good and politely declinedVery friendly very clean great prices and damn good pizza They have tons of specials so you can't go wrong Check this place out if you haven't already.
3704,0,After looking for a car wash & vacuum in the area I selectioned Francis & Sons I checkeed thier priced on thier website but when I got thier the price they wanted to charge was much more they kept trying to sell an upholstery cleaning and then said I don't take care of my care so there would be an additional $20 to clean the black plastic exterior pieces I only wanted a qhick exterior  clean and vacuum They refused to honor thier website pricing and insisted that what I read on thier website was not on there Needless to say I didn't get my car washed there I would highly recommend AVOIDING these crooks.
4264,0,"Sorry don't agree with most of ya yelpers on this place I wanted to stop by this place for awhile so Sunday I took the trip down here to see what some of the fuss was all about Cheap good food drew me in and I'm a sucker for fish tacos I drove up to this place thinking yes this does look like a hippies house with all the misc crap placed all over the walls ceilings and windows I wouldn't say it had much of the beach vibe I think they were going for or maybe it's just me I have lived most of my life in San Diego and near the Beach and most little beach shacks I've been to have a different vibe to them On the board it said something like famous fish taco's or something like that I thought oh yes then got to try those I really don't know why I insist to challenge my gut feeling of ""don't order the fish taco's your in the middle of the freakin desert there is no ocean for hundreds of miles"" but no I had to order them Taco's were cheap like $2 a piece The guy working at the counter that took our order was super friendly he took the time to ask us how are day was going and what have we been up to and stuff We waited about five minutes and our order was up While waiting I was looking around at all the mess that was placed everywhere and was wondering how this tied into there ""theme""   And I wonder how long it's been since this place has gotten a good scrub or at least a dustingOK our order was up and we sat in the back on some picnic benches It was hot but they did have a huge fan that made it bearable to sit back there We opened up our fish taco's and noticed wow these are huge They piled all sorts of stuff in there cabbage rice ton's of cheese fish some sort of secret sauce all on a flour kinda thick shell (taste like the mission brand) Grabbed the taco with both hands and bit into the taco Blahhhh it was the fish Oh man the fish killed it taste so fishy and soggy it was gross Next don't ask me why I did it but I thought I'd try it again So I poured the red hot sauce they had given on it and tried it again Blahhhh gross gross gross The sauce didn't help at all There sauce had no heat to it and the fish was just as bad as the first bite I had bought two taco's and looked in back of me and there were two guys in there 20's macking down on taco's and I offered them our taco's we didn't eat They said no man where good So I couldn't even give these away for free We drove off grossed out and I had this fishy taste in my mouth for about 20 minutes before I had to stop and get something else to eat to get the taste out Soda wasn't doing the trick I remember saying to my husband in the car driving off I don't feel good I think I'm going to puke really my stomach hurt and in no way do I have a sensitive stomach Like others had said I really did want to like this place but no way I'll ever ever return Sorry."
3028,1,MF LegitI didn't know how good they were to me until I moved from Avondale to N Phx They hook up deals and take care of you if you are a regHINT: Plan an extra 5 minutes into your trip they love to shoot the breeze Everyone's chill here.
29,1,After my experience at Papago Brewery I now spend my time at Four Peaks any time I am in the mood for a good beer I like their Arizona Peach Ale and their Hefeweizen I usually order their veggie pesto pizza or chicken enchiladas I know your probably thinking what I was thinking enchiladas at a brewery They are delicious I always take home the leftovers which are just as good the next day My husband is predictable he always orders the salmon blt Con - I wish Four Peaks had a better happy hour Maybe 1/2 price appetizers which would bring me in more often Regardless I still keep going back.
662,1,This place is really clean inviting and comfortable My wife and I came here for a weekend staycation I have a local business nearby and I will be recommending te Staybridge for my customers from out of town.
2519,1,I love Costco I'm not even a member here and I love coming (don't worry I always come with members) It's busy on weekends (as expected) but slower on weeknights Staff are friendly food/drinks are cheap and I always spend way too much money here On a side note my boyfriend and I just bought our bedroom furniture set here and we are super impressed with the quality and price Furniture stores are charging double or even triple what we paid for and we are completely happy with our purchase I also like to browse Costco online to see what's not in store So I will happily keep returning even if it's not this exact location.
452,1,Best liquor store I have ever been to Every time I am in Tempe I make it a point to visit this place They have a huge selection of all kinds of liquor I come here for the beer Which has an incredible selection of brews I could spend hours here looking through their very huge selection of beers I love that you can buy single 12oz bottles instead of having to commit to a whole six pack.
1410,1,Great placeto eat  Atmousphere is nothing fancy but the food is awesome I have visited several times and each time seems better than the last  Skip the first couple pages of the menu and jump to the back  The first few pages are the americanized dishes  The back of the menu has the more authentic Asian dishes  Dinner sets offer a fantastic value and lots of food  Great place for family style meal with large group.

1553,0,We usually really like this restaurant but DO NOT order the street taco appetizer For $995 you get 4 mini corn tortilla with 1 or 2 matchstick size pieces of steak in fact one taco only had one matchstick piece If you go here for lunch stick to the burgers or Pizzas.
832,1,Love this place  We have stopped in here quite a few times since they have opened and always have a good time  It seems to be our Sunday Funday destination  The bar staff is friendly and personable (we love Heather Ashley and Dan)  The food is unique (sort of like upscale campfire food) and delicious  Oh and Bonfire has THE BEST MACARONI AND CHEESE in town  Hot and bubbly a Vermont White Cheddar mac and cheese that comes out in a mini cast iron skillet  It is simply amazing  I tried the Pecan Grilled Harris Ranch Burger last night for the first time and it was fantastic  Very juicy and tasty  Hands down one of the best burgers I have had in Scottsdale.
1105,1,"One of the best places to bring visiting guests Go early as they do not take reservations Happy hour is 3-5 T-F with buck 50 tacosLong story shortalthough the tableside guacamole is ""fun"" skip it so you have room for everything else including the churro dessert Portions are not enormous but decentThis is not your Americanized Mexican restaurant Everything is gourmet and fabulous with attention to detail I don't consider $20 for an amazing entree to be too expensiveWe usually go here only for special occasions or if we have out of town guests I'm hoping we'll go once a week until I've had everything on the menu."
3428,0,Really funky nasty and trashy neighborhood this place was in The clerk behind the booth was behind metal bars as well I know this is KIND of standard these days but it fit quite well for the neighborhood To make it all the more worse I am 100% sure that I got scabies(skin lice) off of the sheets This was the only hotel I stayed at the time Normally considered a STD That was a horrible experience My dogs got it too and had to go to the vet and it took me weeks to get over it and I had to cover myself from the top of my head to the soles of my feet and itch even more because that was a sign that the medicine was working  I had to wash my wardrobe three times to make sure the bugs were dead and constantly had to clean the house and try not to touch a thing while I was getting over it UghNot all Motel 6's are like this but in Phoenix they might be.
4137,0,Live bug in sauceI saw a bug crawling in Green sauce which I already put it in my food  When I reported it to waiter there she just disappeared with the sauce No one came to my table for 10 minutes and  I had to call waiter to replace my food with bug infected food after 10 minutesWorst experience ever.
4430,0,"Perhaps it was our fault for not having tried Dunkin Donuts before but my husband and I went and tried the egg and bacon croissant sandwich plain coffee a glazed donut and a boston creme donut Our cashier was friendly and chatty but couldn't answer a single question Us: ""Is the iced coffee sweetened with high fructose corn syrup"" Her: ""I don't know it sure is sweet though""Us: ""What is in the chocolate kreme donut"" Her: ""It's really good I've had 3 today I don't know chocolate stuff""Nothing was outright disgusting but it was pretty mediocre The coffee was so hot that we both burned out tongues and once it cooled down it was so weak and flavorless that neither of us can understand how it possibly beat Starbucks in a fair taste test Do the people who participated in the test like coffee Whatever Now we know that we don't like Dunkin but I'm left wondering how the place is so popular let alone still in business with such lackluster product decor and vacuous service."
1147,1,Stopped in here one night right before Christmas  Short and sweet:Margaritas - very good (and huge by the way)Tacos - awesomeGuacamole - excellentService - 5 starsLove this place  If you haven't gone here you are missing out on a great little place here in Phoenix.
3919,0,"Seriously I like my Thai food a lot and this place was pretty much a joke We decided to get a few appetizers and split an entree for lunch The place was empty for the exception of two dirty fish tanksThe Thai rolls were overcooked and greasy served with a side of some ketchup/duck sauce mixture that was more ketchup than anything They were placed nicely on some shredded lettuce that they probably got from the dollar store next doorNext was the vegetable tempura again over cooked over breaded and served on a bed of lettuce with that same ketchup sauce AwesomeThe next delightful failure was the tempura tofu that was supposed to come with peanut sauce but consistency remained as it was served over cooked on a bed of lettuce with that damn ketchup sauce We did remind our server about the peanut sauce and she did rectify the situation The peanut sauce was also watery and extremely lameWe shared the yellow curry with tofu The best part about this dish is that it DID NOT come atop the lettuce with a side of ketchup sauceThe rice was a bit sticky the curry sauce was missing something I'm not quite sure what but it was missing something The veggies were soft and over done two of the four pieces of potato were undercooked I guess I should look at that as a bonusThe server was fine a little quiet but no problems with the service She was just doing her job With our ""coupon"" the total bill still seemed a bit high not to mention the fact that they tax the predetermined tip with everything elseStay far away."
3433,0,They have the worst pizza and wings I have ever had in my life I had asked for mild sauce for the wings and they arrived without any sauce The wings were soaked in grease and tasted horrible The pizza dough was very doughy and flavorless I would not recommend anybody order food from this location.

3601,0,I would never go to ANY Hooters every again I have been to all locations in the valley and my experiences there have always been horrible Horrible service management is completely rude The servers are always talking to a table of young guys while neglecting other tables Never prebusses the tables so I am forever eating beside empty bowls Also every time I order wings they are ALWAYS BLOODY Talk about gross The girls are not cute and the food is horrible I do not recommend any to go there ever Plenty of other concept restaurants with good food and service Do not go there.
1029,1,The best Mexican food we've found in the Phoenix/Scottsdale area since we moved here a few years ago  Tried it initially based on a recommendation and now El Encanto is where we take all of our out-of-town guests for a great meal paired with great ambianceMy personal favorite is the pollo fundito  Great flavor great portion size  I also really like the salsas that come out with the chips before the meal  The first time I was there I wound up taking a container home  We're always sure to get deep-fried ice-cream as a desert too  The pond in the center of the property is beautiful (except for the one instance we saw where a bunch of large geese all ganged up and attacked a small helpless duckthe wait staff did their best to save it)  Also don't allow yourself to get seated in the back room of the restaurant  No view of the pond and a large loud clunky heater or a/c unit kills the ambiance  We'll be back many more times I'm sure.
350,1,I have been here so far quite a few times and have not been disappointed yet Great atmosphere great food great live music on fridays and saturdays I have been here for both dinner and drink and for lunch and a beer The atmosphere is always laid back and never really uncomfortable Looking for a great irish pub experience here in phx az Rosie McCaffrey's is your place for small and quaint Enjoy.

2457,0,"We are dismayed by your contentious and factually incorrect replyThe four women who made the complaint had initially engaged us by ohhhhing and awwwing over the service animal and pushed for us to display her to them The animal at no time 'ate off the table' or even sniffed the table If you are going to take the side of these disruptive harridans then you should be in possession of the facts So after pushing us to allow them to interact with the dog when my wife offered the animal a morsel of chicken out of her salad these people took that ""gotcha' moment to run to the manager to complainThe manager as we have stated then confronted us obviously playing to the audience at the next table and proceeded to make a public spectacle of us in the restaurant When  we refused to move to the back room where he said ""the people with service animals sit"" we left to avoid further humiliation that had greatly upset my wife Your manager further emphasized twice his desire that we ""never come into this restaurant again""His bullying tactics as well as your self serving and factually erroneous attack on us above shows your desire for retribution rather than conciliation and further solidifying our assertion of hostility discrimination and bullying at your restaurantBesides the food was uninspired and a disappointment in and of itself."

3740,0,I noticed this place pulling in to the shopping center where Barrelhouse wasa video shop what in the heckso weird  Anyway I walk out and I realize I have been looking for Devil's Reject's and House of 1000 Corpses for god knows how long  Screw it why not check this place outIf you thought to yourselfman video stores have been out since the early 90's  Not this one  This one has been out since the 80's  The carpet had like palm trees  And even better there's an adult section in the back that has mint colored palm tree cut outs that go across the top of the doorwaymust be the entry way to heaven oOUnfortunately they didn't have either movie I wanted  Otherwise I would've gotten past the ugliness and the stale smell of my indoor childhood skating rink  I have no reason to come back to this place because I live in THIS century and I will just buy them online So much for nostalgia.
4579,0,I brought in my Volvo for simple routine maintenance they forgot to rest the warning indicator so I brought it back and it took them a half hour to reset and they charged over $200 A week later my battery failed and it was all corroded and obviously never inspected I am going back to the dealer where they charge less and I don't have any further issues Stay away.
3324,0,"If you want to drop $250-$300 & absolutely not impress a date this is the place Stuffy Pretentious uncomfortable & Mediocre Summarizes This Venue The Resort entry & valet parking is very impressive (1st class) You will walk thru a beautiful Spanish Hacienda Court Yard to enter this old world decadent restaurant (Still 1st class) ""So what's the problem"" you ask Well when you enter this restaurant with a reservation a snooty hostess will guide to their rather cramped bar to wait for 1 - 1  1/2 hrs to get your table(OK it's a popular high end place & you can practice your art of conversation over the loud volume of many other patrons waiting the same lousy treatment from the hostess) Oh this is when sticker shock is about to hit you $30-$35 for a beer (a Guinness) & a glass of wine You finally get seated & the waiting staff is doing one hell of a job trying to sell you an expensive bottle of wine (This part of the experience is very similar to buying Time Share) So you order another glass of wine & beer which makes you seem like a cheapskate or get treated as such Now the food does taste good but with rather small portions & rather hefty sticker it makes you masticate every bite & really taste your dish But how much am I paying for this dish It's only half a cut of the fish Despite all the mastication it is very hard to swallow Somehow you finish your dish (Mom would be so proud of you cause' your plate is as clean as if it came out of the dish washer) So you are now ready for the big finally & the waiters ""Fave Pick"" on desert Well off course there are two scrumdiddlyumptious recommends that you will have with the two tiniest espresso shots So your bill for $240+ makes its way to the table & boy if you're planning tipping only 15% you will get the ""you cheapskate evil eye"" walking out of this restaurant Oh 'yah' don't forget to tip the valet $5 tip also will get you a ""are you kidin' me look as well""."
4028,0,This has been one of my regular spots for Italian beef since the 90's  My trip today will be my last   Luke's used to have their own beef that was tasty  Well today they used some frozen Vienna beef that was like rubber taste was not nearly the same and the color was off  This made me sad since I've been a long time customer  This isn't the first example of them cheapening out  I guess I will have to go through the trouble of making my own Italian beef and will have to find a good jar giardiniera.
3326,0,This will NEVER be a shopping destination for me Unless I need to visit THE APPLE STORE I'm staying awayFor the most part the center is a collection of OVER PRICED restaurants and clubsIf YOU need your ego (or other parts) stroked by barely 21 year old female WANNA-BEE'S  Take a VIAGRA and your wallet with youThe parking availability is terriblePlus the Valet reserved zones have made it shopper unfriendly.
720,0,I went to this store twice to buy a pair of nice work shoes The first time I found exactly what I wanted and went up to the counter to get a pair to try on The associate didn't greet me at all and took the shoe from my hand and went to the back to retrieve the shoes I walked away before she got back I went back a week later did the same thing and this was a different associate She looked at me like I was a Leper when I walked up the counter took the shoe from my hand Not one smile from either of these woman not one hello I turned and walked away from this woman as well This store hires stuck up 20ish snobs They don't deserve my business and they won't ever have the opportunity to get it again.
4919,0,Complete and utter rip off  I bought tires from them had a flat and they were going to charge my $25 to fix it  I called Discount Tire and they fixed it for free  Imagine that a company that will fix another company's problem and for no charge  The other problem I had with this place was that they wanted to charge me $125 to read the fault codes off of my truck when your local auto parts dealer will do this for free  Everything about this place irks me and they prey on people who are not auto savvy and they have gotten away with it for so long  Please stay away from this place as they are way too expensive and will probably be the place to sell you something you do not need if they have the chance.
4006,0,I was starving and just needed something quick before the bar so I wasn't drinking on an empty stomach  And even THAT didn't stop me from sending back my overly breaded overly cooked rock hard chicken strips and asking for a refund because I didn't even want to consider eating anything else they made  Ick  I'd rather eat at Subway and that's saying a lot.
507,1,The first impression I got was a very welcoming one The sweet man at the front greeted us and was SO sweet and nice I liked how clean the restaurant is too I ordered the Mongolian beef and my boyfriend had the orange beef they were both delicious I went because this place was highly rated on here and I'm glad we did We will be returning very soon to try other things on their menu.
2098,1,For a while we have noticed that customer service has gone way down hill We had several bad experiences with the competitor right down the street from us and decided to try another store Not only was this store clean and the prices were very reasonable but the staff there is what makes this store phenominal On a random oh we need dog food trip we decided to go to Pet Smart on Elliot We walked in went right to our pet food with easy to find shelving and unfortunately they were out of the size we needed Within 2 minutes a polite employee walked by asked if we needed help we asked if they had the smaller size from a 35 lb to a 25 lb bag and he said he would check At this point we decided to try a different flavor but of the same brand it was at the price we usually spend else where and was the size we needed Upon the employees return he stated that they were all out but offered a solution which was selling us the smaller bags 3 which would equal the same amount as the bag size we needed for the same price as the bag size offered We did the math later and it turns out for about 24 bucks you get 5 extra pounds of food then you would normally going that route I was so blown away with not only the friendliness the willing to help but also the offering of a solution We bought the other flavor thanked him for his effort and made our way to the register which we were greeted by a nice employee who even struck up a conversation about the pet smart card which we forgot and asked what kind of pets we had When we got out to the car we both had smiles on our face we couldn't believe the effort the politeness the treating a human being like a human being It is now why we will only shop at Pet Smart Petco on 48th had some bad customer service but compared to Pet Smart it was horrible service Shop only at Pet Smart the cost and savings are better the employees actually want your business and are willing to help anyway they can.
2226,1,The croissant breakfast is hands down my favorite Great coffee and service Love this place My wife's favorite is the chorizo burrito.
1556,1,This place reminds me of the many breakfast joints I miss in the Chicago area Good basic food Plenty of it Super low prices Down-home informal good stuff Don't get me wrong If you're looking for organic and upscale you're headed for La Grande Orange or True Food ($$$) If you want the best tasting breakfast you've ever had you're going to Matt's Big Breakfast ($$) If you want a place to eat every week (or more) that's good filling inexpensive and convenient for meeting with people it's Fast Eddie's Joe's Diner or Acacia Cafe.
4710,0,"Terrible  My wife and I went there early afternoon on ThursdayFirst the counter attendant commits the ultimate faux pas:""Are you together""Well duh it's 2010  Two wedding bands my wife has lineage from Germany and Sweden and me somewhere in N Africa but at least greet me before telling me that my wife of 10 years and I don't look like a coupleNext the food was miserableI had an ""Orange Peel Beef"" and the dish felt like someone breaded beef jerky fried it hard and poured a bottle of mystery sauce over it  All of the chili sauce at Pei Wei's couldn't save the dish   Any vegetables in the dish had the consistency of something unpacked out of the freezer and dumped right in the deep fat fryer  Again I ask myself why in the world can't we get at least basically edible Chinese in ArizonaMy wife or colleague as the front counter attendant assumed ordered some chicken dishAgain over-breaded had the taste and consistency of an order of McDonalds McNuggets drenched in a tub of sweet 'n sour sauce and poured over white riceThis was literally the first time we went back to our home and dug out leftovers after spending almost $30 on lunch  Literally my best experience about our meal at Pei Wei was the drive home  Three of three strikes shame on us for giving it another shotPei Wei was awesome about three years ago but now it's to the level of Paradise Valley Mall food court and that sucks  This place needs an enormous amount of customer service training and at least a weekend ""food stand-down"" and retraining of the chef'sI was HEAVILY disappointed  Again."
2801,1,well I am back again and I cant stop not coming to this place To review I love the ambiance of this place the warmth provided by the people here and ofc the food I got my veggie platter again with the 4 dishes being Fried Okra Mac & cheese 2 Eggs/Cheese & Onions and I cant remember what else but I remember feeling amazing bout it :) Oh wait did i eat waffles ah well I cant remember I think I should stop eating the sides and eat something else for a change next time like the salad maybe ah well to the next time then.
1149,1,The St Francis is great  Food and drinks are very good and their happy hour is the best  Love the atmosphere and is a great place for drinking and dinning outside.
129,1,"I love Coco's even if it's stereotyically an ""eatery for the elderly"" They make great pancakes and the waiters are always very friendly It's way better than Denny's or Village Inn Coco's is also a regional chain so it's more exclusive."
1409,1,I can only add my gushing praise to the other reviews  Not only is the food outstanding (pork osso bucco green chile stew and pecan/fig pie) but the ambiance and service really help make this place a standout  So many places have arrogant stuffy service so Scottsdale  Not so here  Also the waitstaff had opinions about the food - which dishes are his favorite and why  Elegant but comfortable atmosphere reasonable prices and a real enthusiasm from the staff (and a chef who came to visit with folks that he knew who were sitting near us)  The food is rich but did not seem unhealthily so - not bathed in salt and heavy cream sauce  Perfect portion size with a balance - meat grains and veggies  So happy that Beckett's is in the neighborhood(Oh - and no valet  I  hate valet parking when there is an ample adjacent parking lot and spots are only limited because the valets put their cones in the available spots).
1534,0,Never again  This place is the worst  They didn't even vacuum the trunk  Bring back the illegals americans are too lazy and stupid to even wash a car.
1428,1,Can you believe this place Awesome like an adult Candy storeEverything you could ever want for any type of party or event is at this storeThe candy choices are unreal I mean anything you could wantEven Candy you do not think they make any more at allAs Monica Oput it Candy Heaven and so it isIt is so worth it just to go here and see all the great things that they have to offerEven sugar free candy Love this store.
815,1,"Blue Wasabi has become my new favorite sushi joint in town A very hip trendy sushi bar with young fun servers I was never a sushi fan but always loved the idea of ""going out to sushi"" With that said it's very important to me that a sushi restaurant offers a variety of non-seafood menu items I had The Clucker and The Bada Bing both wrapped in soy paper and they were both amazing We heard that Sundays were 1/2 alcoholic beverages if you wore a blue shirt so after church we actually drove home and changed our shirts before going but when we got there we heard the server offer the special to our neighboring table who weren't wearing blue It was a great experience and we will definitely be going back."
628,1,Love the Lobster enchiladas not on the menu special item usually Saturdays The flan is excellent Family run business very friendly people Recipes have been handed down for generations.
4092,0,Where do I start  The burgers - All  were over cookedThe fries - they were soggy  We told the waitress that they weren't edible and sent them back  She brought out a new order and they were just as bad as the firstWarm Jumbo Bacon Salad - It's listed under Starter on the menu and that's how we ordered it  It came out after all the burgers and fries  The bacon on the salad wasn't cooked  It wasn't edibleChocolate Bread Pudding -  It was cold in the centerWe thought they had a great concept for a restaurant and we love burgers so we were excited to eat there  We will never go back.
4552,0,Well I am not a fan of sprint to start of just customer service is not a big part of there picture  :(.
1582,1,I love this place I can't think of a better place to eat pizza in the valley take that Pizzeria Bianco  All of the pizza is great and the place has a great vibe  If you are a fan of LGO and the Vig this is your place  Try the mushroom or pepperoni pizza I do have a word of warning be careful when you make your own pizza since before i knew it i had made a $25 12 inch pizza but that was because i misread the menu opps.
70,1,OK this review is for happy hour only I plan on trying Marcella's for lunch and/or dinner in the near future so I'll update once I doWhen I heard Marcella's was opening at Fashion Square I was so excited Marcella's originated in Columbus Ohio and there are two locations there My Ohio friends rave all the time about Marcella's -now that it is here in Scottsdale I finally could find out what all the buzz was aboutMarcella's is located next to Modern Steak and is in the new Barney's wing Parking is available in the lot across from Grand Lux and if there are no open spots in the evening you can park in the underground garage I met a friend who moved here from Columbus for happy hour last Wednesday night I arrived first and secured us two spots at the outside bar Our bartender Josh (I am pretty sure that was his name) was a sweetheart and chatted with us quite a bit and provided excellent serviceMy friend had the red sangria which she really enjoyed while I stuck with Stella Artois As a note the beers on draft are Peroni or Stella No cheapo American beers here on draft thankfully For food we had the zucchini garlic cheese bread and the pesto shrimp pizza All the food was really good especially the pizza The food was great but what is even better are the happy hour prices The appetizers range from $225 to $495 while the pizzas will run you from $495 to $650 Beer and sangria are $3 wine by the glass is half off and martinis and specialty cocktails are $5 Plus happy hour runs from 3-7 pm so working people can actually make it and enjoy a few drinks Marcella's definitely has the best happy hour deal in town now that it is openI can't wait to go back to try more of the appetizers and to have a full meal Thank you Cameron Mitchell for expanding Marcella's from Columbus to Scottsdale You have made this Ohio transplant very happy.

4365,0,"READ THIS REVIEW if you are willing to do the following:1) support a local business2) have a knack for bitter and angry women3) take time of work meaning a whole day of work 4) be on call and not do anything until they come to your home5) be hung up on6) PAY for crappy servicea lady from this 7 person office calls me in reference to a service that was schedule between 1-4 pm  this was per the property manager However there was a miscommunication between the business and the manager all I knew was it was between 1pm to 4pmi was on my way to the house to take care of the issue  Before i forget to mention this  A lady calls me at 12:50 asking me how far was I from the home  i answered give me 15 minutes (I was still thinking about the 1-4pm time slot) she then said you know this is not going to happen  the property manger this the property manager that  this is ridiculous and you guys should've been there and went on and on and on and on  and she was on my cars bluetooth on blast with my 11 and 9 year and  i said well i apologize for that i will there as soon as possible then she said  no its not going to happen ma'am not today  this is not going to happen ma'am  she uses the word ma'am like she was to say *insert profanity here*  then i asked how can we resolve this maybe  if we can work on rescheduling (first of all WHY am I as the consumer would be trying to make things work when she was standoffish to begin with IDK maybe i am still hoping for world peace)  and she was like ugh no I need to call American Home Shield and the owner I don't know this is ridiculous and I asked well can we get a time maybe for next week and then call us if its possible or not and she NO MA'AM I AM NOT GOING TO THAT all loud  and asked  excuse me did I say something to offend you  and here goesSHE HUNG UP i called back and she said YES I HUNG UP ON YOU and hung up again I was disappointed with the property manager and made sure he knew I felt however Angry lady's action was uncalled for wow now i know why some people pay a premium for larger companies  since this will not be toleratedWhen i read the review from Mollie C  why am I not surprisedThe following has been done:1) filed an executive complaint with the BBB2) a copy was sent to American Home Shield and the FTC  just in case this company tries to make a quick buckand ask for the $75 deductible 2) a letter to Mr Little  the owner and according to the grumpy lady on the phone he was the ""technician"" he that was waiting do I guess if the owner of the company is performing the service  you need to bow down to him  its like the president of the United states is doing you a favor and exempted all taxes due for you and your familySCOREthis is the worst service I have received  better yet treatment from a COMPLETE stranger."
3717,0,QUANTITY NOT QUALITY mostly NOT EDIBLEThe good-my ice tea and the pickle chipsThe bad-rye bread as thick as my thumb (rye bread should be thin)low fat  low quality corned beef that appeared to be previously frozen because of dark color but had added grease fat added to each side of each slice of meat that seemed to be mostly burger grease (because of the remnants of burger I found in my sandwich) and other assorted grease The dressing was thinned down to a milky substance The cheese used was processed not real cheese  The sour kraut had a few of someones grilled burger onions in it The salad was water logged and not drained and I had an inch or more of water in the bowlThe waitresses all were sleeveless and that doesn't seem sanitary because of all that reaching everywhere how do you know if some deodorant or antiperspirant didn't flake off into your food  My waiter seemed very rushed the whole timeFelt sick to my stomach after hereand on the way out I saw ketchup bottles on the patio tables outside that may have been opened and were possibly spoiling in the high heat outsideI know most people only enjoy the fatty breakfast here since they are used to that  and that is cool  They are really large and most people I saw were LOVING that.
235,1,Here is my recommendation try anything here (it's ALL GOOD)  However my favorite is brunch here  You must try a Bloody Marythey make them with NM Red Chile instead of Tabascoit's delish  Foodwise I recommend the Enchiladas & Eggsadd green Chile chicken and you have a feast suitable for the Gods  This is definitely a splurge spot but it's my favorite  I have had probably over 50% of the menu and all is good  This place is tinyso it can be tough to grab a seat but well worth the wait if you have your heart set on some Amazing NM foodPlus let's care itwith enough Bloody Mary's EVERYTHING tastes awesome.
2318,1,I do not get to go to the Herb Box often enough I love it I think it is the perfect place to meet friends as the atmosphere is laid back and cute Their lunch menu is great though I only order one thing every time the veggie and hummus wrap without cheese which is their happy something or other salad in a wrap form with hummus so surely that salad must be fantastic too I don't know how they do it but it is exceptional even with seemingly simple ingredients Their sweet potato chips are amazing and so are their crispy edamame I love their variety of iced teas and could quite likely eat there every day It is a bit pricier than my typical lunch but for Scottsdale and for the quality of food it is a great deal.
2887,1,Wow what a great little place Growing up in Louisiana and longing for a shrimp or Po-boy Flavor of Louisiana you have answered the mail and talk value you get your monies worth.

4435,0,Unfortunately this place has shut down for good and i'm not exactly sure why Could it be for health code reasons just like EFS was shut down If anyone knows please chime in.
785,1,We ordered take-out from Il Bosco last night and was extremely pleased with the food but also the service I wasn't expecting much since it was almost closing time and from my experience with other places is that the employees usually want to get out of there so theres attitude or a sense of being rushed to get me out the door but when I arrived to pick up my order the owned greeted me with such a cool calm and collected demeanor which  was such a pleasure he even helped me carry my food and walked me out to my car The place itself had a great atmosphere I can see myself and my husband coming back to eat in next time I would definitely recommend this place to my friends and family.
4925,0,Sorely disappointed in our experience here on 12/12/13 so much so I'm compelled to write my first ever restaurant review on Yelp  Yes the food is very good but I would absolutely not patronize this restaurant again because of the incredibly poor service  It's truly sad as my friends and I were very excited to find that a non-chain scratch kitchen type restaurant was opening so close to our homes  We would love to support a local business  However after an absolute debauchery of a serving experience with 9 individuals in our party I'd be embarrassed to recommend or bring anyone back to this establishment  In short the wait staff is poorly trained unprofessional and also uninviting and rude  After 30+ minutes of struggling with our waiter to accurately check us out we had to call in the owner / manager  He himself was not rude however it was apparent he was also ill equipped to handle customer issues and resolve them properly  We gave ample feedback on how they can improve I hope they take it but I'm unconvinced at this point that they will  Several of us joked that the only way we would return would be for take out the food is truly good but that is where it ends  Sad as I believe they could get away with pretty low customer service with this type of menu / food just not atrocious.
2194,1,Duck and Decanter is more than just a sandwich shop for meAs a young girl I would frequently come to D&D with my dad We would always get sandwiches and I would be allowed to get a prize from the toy chest (not sure if they have it anymore) It was a place where we got to spend time together and bond which was rare because as an  OB/GYN my dad was frequently on call and at work I was pleased to recently find out that after all of these years Duck and Decanter has not lost its honey feel warm ambiance and quality of their food This June I took my dad there for Father's Day lunch The sandwiches were as good as I remember Nothing extravagant or peculiar just classic sandwiches Fresh breads crispy lettuce vine ripened tomatoes (among other things) and yummy mayonnaise Not to mention their meat is very high quality and fresh-- all still at the amazing quality I remember as a young girl- fantastic The staff is nice helpful and super friendly They give the place a warm feel to it While you're there make sure to shop around a bit as they do have quite a few little trinkets and specialty food items like hot sauces chocolates and jams All of their items are fairly moderately priced as well To eat you can either go upstairs to their loft area sit on their tucked away yet lively patio or in the lobby area of the restaurant All places are nice clean and family friendly Duck and Decanter is truly a great place to get a great quality sandwich and spend some quality time with the family.
4705,0,Why would anyone pay money for food like this.
1387,1,My husband and I love Toyama we started coming here after Mo opened (We used to visit him at a restaurant where he worked) this is by far the best sushi bar in the ValleyWhy might you askHere you go:*  My husband works in procurement for a major hotel company buying fish and beef - he knows fresh fish*  Did you ever talk to the customers at the sushi bar  Many are local Valley chefs - chefs only eat where there is good fresh food*  Friendly Sushi Chefs - The chef/owner is one of the sushi chefs he will explain fish to you help you try new things and is pretty creative  They treat their customers right  (And so does Mimi Mo's wife)*  Service Staff - how many servers greet you by name when you walk in and have your favorite beverage right up for you  Also Mo's had very consistent staff over the years meaning they like working there and get along*  Tempura - don't laugh - but one of the better tempura batters around - try itWe have been missing our weekly/bi-weekly sushi fixes lately due to travel but with the fall back we will see you at Toyama.
4019,0,The service was horrible The TV was on a station showing a deer being hunted and killed All in all a terrible experience.
2706,1,I absolutely love this location at Serranos Their customer service is amazing The layout of this restaurant is very unique and gives you many options of tables to sit at depending on how you feel I am obsessed with the chips they deliver at the beginning of your meal The chips come with salsa and bean dip which are to die for Their margaritas are amazing and you can not come here without trying one I have yet to try an item on the menu I do not like.
2955,1,I just finished my Head to toe Glow package and I feel like i have added 10 years to my life :0)  Spa Lamar is a wonderful retreat  I cant wait to bring my mother in for a spa day when she comes to visit  Kudos.

2276,0,"Tonight was our second time at this Chompie's and had I written this review after our first visit I would have given it 4 stars  However after the service we received tonight we will not back  After reading other reviews one can only assume that the Borenstein's have made so much money that they could care less about what kind of service their patrons get  We arrived around 5:00pm and the restaurant was not very crowded yet  My husband order a soup and sandwich and I ordered the Jewish sliders  Long story short  every table around us received their food even though they arrived after us  It took so long that the couple next to us commented on how long our food was taking (at this point they were almost done with their meal)  Not being able to locate our server I went up to the hostess and asked if someone could find out where our food was  In less than a minute the manager (Phil) magically plots the food on the table and says ""the sliders just take a really long time""  No apology nothing  Without  going into the a lengthy description of the dialogue that followed between my husband and Phil suffice it to say that Phil had real attitude for manager  At no time did he offer an apology free dessert or to take anything off the bill  He practically blamed us for being too impatientTo make matters worse right after Phil left the table our server Justin decide to continue with the attitude  He asked us how everything was and my husband replied that ""he didn't know yet because we just got our food""  Justin didn't seem to understand why my husband was so upset and my husband explain about the wait for the food  Justin's reply  ""Well you have your food now  what's the problem""I left out lot's of detail but you get the picture they could give a crap about service  I don't care how good the food is but rude service with attitude especially from management is never acceptable  We will not be back."
2423,1,We were there for the official first night last night I had the bone in filletwhich was exceptionaland my husband ordered the bone in veal chop Maryland crab cake and meatballs were our appetizers  Everything was first class hot delicious perfect Our server Elizabeth was a delighton the ball and well informed by the kitchen The lavish surroundings complete the picture  Staff were friendly and knowledgable Great bar area Food cannot be too expensive when it is that good but be prepared to pay for the finest grade of aged meat and fresh fresh seafoodIf I have one small criticism it would be that the tables are too closely grouped making it difficult for the less experienced servers (water bearers) to navigate without bumping into the diners on chairs in their path Seems to be many different levels making it a visually appealing restaurant but perhaps a bit of an obstacle course.
2220,1,While the weather has been so agreeable lately so has my appetite to crawl over to DC Ranch and sit on the outside patio of Armitage This place has become our backyard getaway - where everyone knows you by nameand drink I have also enjoyed the REVERSE HAPPY HOUR - and later fare menu - Happy Hour is not only for the early birds anymore :)Market Street is such an enjoyable area at night with the twinkling lights spotted about.
1492,1,Amazing Everything my wife and I had was fantastic Also our first time trying foie gras which is now my number one favorite food Highly recommend this place.
338,1,REVIEW PURELY BASED ON HAPPY HOUR:WOW  where do I begin1 amazing happy hour prices (drinks too) DRAGON ROLL $62 fast service3 friendly staff4 great music5 overall perfect nightexcept for the random girl bringing us a round of sushi and just standing next to our table without saying ONE WORD Just looking at us  Not saying what she has or anything normal  It was weird.
1811,1,"Whoa  Whomever has been keeping this place a secret---shame on youThis deli was recommended by a friend and my wife told me about it when I wanted to go out for dinner instead of the ol' mac-n-cheese the kids were having  I was extremely hesitant as ""deli"" means different things to different people  For most places in Arizona it means ""sure we've got processed meat""The Deli in Queen Creek is nothing of the sort  It is family-owned goodness  I was caught browsing the menu outside and immediately upon entering was greeted by regulars who said 'you won't be disappointed' -- What a compliment  A very friendly staff greeted me and I chose to take home the Cuban sandwich and the hot pastrami  First let me tell you the portions are more than generous  That's the sign of a good deli  The Cuban was fantastic  The pastrami was no slouch either but when put against the Cuban it was hard to measure upThis little place out in the south side of QC probably won't be quiet for long  The atmosphere inside is very welcoming for a nice night out with friendsThe specials they advertised the weekend I cam in seemed a little high for the type of restaurant but the sandwich prices were reasonable  They advertise fresh/local ingredients and it tasted like it -- it was fabulousI can't wait to go back with friends."

2926,1,Had a great experience with Scott and Jason from Critter Ridder I have had previous problems with rats in both my attics I heard noises in my bedroom I called Scott the next day He sent Jason out to inspect my house He found no signs of rodent activity He explaned everything in a easy to understand way Jason did not charge me for the inspection As a business owner for over 30 years I can appreciate Scott and Jasons professionalism I would definitely recomend Critter Ridder.
1473,0,"It saddens me to say that this isn't the worst Mexican restaurant we've eaten at that's on Oahu near Waikiki beach but it's close  Damn it we had to drive by Arriba's to get to this place   I had a chimichanga that was a little anemic though what there was of the filling was ok  beans  tasteless rice looked the part but as spicy as your average UK meal involving boiled meat and root vegetables Erin's Fajita salad was similarly lack luster  with  all the appearance of being tasty yet   bland chicken Usually unless there's an attempt at ""chefing"" as opposed to cooking  I'll order a basic dish ( I don't shoot the chef though  and trust me these guys are safe from Agent Sands  very safe)  for the first time out  and if the beans/rice suck no returnOverall It feels like aliens space ones are running the place and they learned cooking from pictures  It's certainly a mistake we won't be repeating."

4590,0,My Compass Visa acct is such a nightmare to me  I'm supposed to get 544% APR  balance transfer FOR LIFE when I first open my acct but when I received my 1st statement I was charged 1344% APR (regular) balance transfer  Also instead of FOR LIFE now it says the duration is only for 99 months I called and the phone rep admitted the error but it would require TWO(2) MONTHS to rectify the error Then I made my payment 2 days after I received the statement but  online still shows that I need to make a min payment of  $XXXX by 5/11/2013 even though they acknowledged receipt of the payment I made  IWO the company never bothered to update the online info  So now I don't know if I should make another payment  This bank must have hired  the absolute lowest efficient workersit is amazing.

1450,1,"Eat here  I felt like a guest judge on Iron Chef  We were a private party of 12 or so in the small but modern ""back"" room  Service was great  Quick to bring yummy sake to start  Our group was served an expanded kaiseki menu  Four small japanese tapa-like apps The menu changes monthly so i'll spare you the details except that everything was wonderful  The waitresses kindly responded to my repeated questioning ""what is in this"" And they actually knew the answersThe appetizer courses were separated by a serving of sushi  By far the most bland pat of the meal  Then came a four foot long serving tray of shashimi and plates of robata grilled meat  The shasima was atop artfully melted ice blocks  Very ""cool""Deserts were flavorful also  Nothing bad to say except bring a lot of moneyAmbiance: modern chic japanese but not tackyService: kind and promptFood:  fing awesome."

4427,0,"I am not one to typically complain but I feel that Top of the Line Perfume (a store In this ""outlet"" mall) is a joke They inflate their prices astronomically and then tell the consumer that they will give a 50% discount  The perfume I purchased was $50 marked down from $89 I found it for $20 on Amazon I called to speak with a manager to no avail Naomi an absurdly rude sales associate would not transfer me to a manager Please save your money."
427,1,I get serious cravings for this place I want it right now  I just wish it was closer and I would eat there so much moreWe used to go there a lot when I was in school It is the best pho I have ever had It is delicious and amazing I do not know how they do it It has so many great vegetables inside it and the broth is so aromatic I also left my wallet there one day I didnt realize it till 800 PM the NEXT day as I was leaving for the AIRPORT OMG I was freaking out I called and they were closing I was so scared I wouldnt be able to get on the plane I told them my situation and one of the employees stayed in his car till I got there 25 minutes later after they were closed He wouldnt even take a tip I had to throw the money in his car and leave It was so wonderful of them and I will never forget it I was able to get on the plane and it worked outI have nothing more to say about this place It has great food Its is super cheap It comes out fast Its healthy What more can you want Go there right now.
4939,0,"Our family decided to give Cibola Vista another chance in August 2012 after a horrible experience the first time we visited there in 2010Our first mistake was in thinking that maybe things had changed over the two years since our last visit they changed alright We thought that it could not get worseWe also wrongly thought that getting the very best high end penthouse suite would help sweeten the experience WRONG The room was a disaster dirty smelly no WI-fi some kind of biological or other fluid all over the TV remote with only half of the light bulbs working urine still sitting in the toilet air-conditioner only cooled the room to 85 degrees after 6 hours The  towels and linens were dingy and smelly The washer and dryer was completely inoperable and the sudden gushing stream of water from the rooftop AC condenser unit into our bathtub at 11:30pm did not bother us as the ""adults"" partying in the unit below us and wandering around the resort in a drunken stupor were louder than the flood in our unit  When we called the front desk to complain we were politely told that they were sorry and would have someone look into it  5 days later still partying loudly The incessant barking dogs left locked into units barked all night and day did not seem so bad after the copious amounts of vomit  still left in the elevator at  11:30 am one morning from the partying the night before People just leave their trash sitting in the hallways hoping someone will take it to the dumpsters for them The BBQ grills are not  cleaned frequently as there was left over fish of some kind all over both of the ones by our unit three days in a row There were no recirculation pumps for the hot water system so it took forever for the water to get hot in the mornings and our whole unit was absolutely infested with crickets Live crickets were in the toilets sinks showers bed hallways within the unit and DON""T open the lower cabinets if you don't like bugs We had to sweep up dead bugs every morning before starting our day The pool while looking inviting was disappointingly warm with the skimmers not appear to be working lots of unrecognizable floating debris and green slime around where the water level in the pool was But even that was comforting compared to the boisterous behavior of the unsupervised unruly drunken fools in the pool it was not even safe enough to let my 5 year old daughter  into the pool The teenage inexperienced ""lifeguards"" that were supposed to be on duty were so busy hiding from the situation behind the slide that they could not have helped anyone anywayIf you are looking for a dirty trashy nasty place to party like a Porkey's style college dorm then this is your placeIf you are looking for a family vacation in a reasonably clean and quiet location look elsewhere as Cibola Vista is a dump with management maintenance facility and customer service issues Very dis-pleased that this is how my time-share money is managedWe will never return to this facility."
2740,1,I went to Salt River 3 times this year for Spring Training games Each was a blast since I am a huge baseball fan I was pleasantly surprised that they had such a variety of food and drinks (Jack Daniels Sangria Mike's Hard Lemonade BEER need I say more) not to mention desserts The thing that sent this place over the top was the lawn area- particularly by the Salty Senorita stand- it was a party each time All in all Salt River Fields made this an unforgettable experience for the crowd and honestly made the boys in the baseball pants look a little hotter-as if that was even possible.
3371,0,Please people wise-up  These Sandwiches are awful  Cheap Italian cold cuts on a big hotdog roll do not make a Sub sandwich  First the meats are pre-sliced and of very poor quality The vegatables have been in the bin too long with brown bits in the lettuce and tomatoes that were sliced while George W was still prez  And people that is a hotdog roll not a sub roll  No structure no body  Look at the pretty signs over the counter now look at the sandwich that you are about to eat  Do they look the same  Well you got what you paid for and you didn't pay much  I swear some people eat for the fuel not for the taste or quality of what they shove down thier cakehole.
1741,1,I woke up late one morning & did not have a chance to eat breakfast so my husband swung by my office & gave me a scone to eat It was the best scone I have ever had so I asked him where he got it & he told me it was from this little coffee house called Steve's I had to go and check it out myself I got there right after they opened (about 5:30 in the morning) so they were not really busy yet but the guys behind the counter both greeted me & one took my coffee order and the other grabbed me a scone  The service was really fast & I was in and out in 2 minutes which was GREAT because I needed to hurry up and get to work Once I was at work I was able to sit down & enjoy what I ordered I got the French Roast which was nice & bold as advertised They use a French Press to brew all their coffee which usually means a 5+ minute wait at any other coffee house (not to mention you have to specifically request it at other places) but because this is their standard method they already had it ready to go But the coffee was not even the best part They had 2 different kinds of scones today Chocolate Chip or Cranberry Orange So I picked the Cranberry one & it was delish Their scones are flaky but still moist & perfect The tart cranberries were just what I wanted in the morning with the sweetness of the scone itself & the strong cup of coffee The sign up front also said that they make all their treats from scratch Great little place to stop in the morning This was the perfect start to my Friday I will definitely be back.
1555,1,We go here a lot for their incredible happy hour And we drive 30 miles to get there too - that's how much we like it Awesome large martinis for $5 the happy hour menu has great selections Get the happy hour salad and split it It's more than enough for two The oysters (big and extremely good) are just one dollar during happy hour A very classy Scottsdale restaurant I probably been to this restaurant six times in the past few months - I've never been disappointed (except when they didn't have any $1 oysters).
2045,0,Thai Mix (red curry) I dont know what this is but it's not Thai  Bland and not even similar to Thai red curry  If you want Thai food hit Royal Thai Grill or Thai Rama  I would have been better off going to Panda Express which makes me cry a little on the inside.
537,1,AMAZING I've had a lot of bbq from Alabama to Georgia to California and in between and this place is right up there with the best of them I had the full slab of ribs one day with baked beans and then I had the 1/2 pound sandwich (half chicken and half pulled pork) Blown away :).
400,1,I love Postino I live a few blocks away from the Arcadia location but go to Central probably one out of every four times My boyfriend lives downtown and it's more convenient sometimes I've grown to enjoy this location slightly more than Arcadia due to the airy atmosphere and large open bar area Don't get me wrong--I still love Arcadia very muchLike everyone else I love the bruschetta but I tend to come for brunch more often now The french toast is probably my favorite menu item I admit that I might indulge in a glass of wine before the clock strikes noon Usually it's a Mimosa for me though Here they are made the way they should be (more champagne than orange)   -) Yay for Postino  :-).

2481,1,Initially it was a bit scary to me but once I got used to being up in the air it was a breeze (pun not intended)  I booked the flight for myself and hubs and for a moment it looked as if it wasn't going to happen due to rain coming into Phoenix  Of all the times  We were called and asked if we wanted to change the date but we couldn't so it was left to see if the original date and weather would cooperate  They didKevin is a hoot which made for a great ride  Very professional but also fun which helped when I was still nervous  He explained many things about ballooning and its history and what things we were floating over (beware the jumping cholla cactus) and even told us there was an app for wind currents (which proves there is an app for every thing) Our ride was a sunrise one and it was amazing to see the sun come over the mountains and watch the other balloons that were also flying that day to inflate and rise But our ride rocked as his will only carry up to 4 people plus him unlike the others which looked like egg crates full of people - they can carry up to 14 at a time some of them As it turned out it was just us and Kevin so it was fantastic  Seeing the world from 5000 feet in the air in a basket is something else  If you want an experience to cross off your Bucket List or for a special occasion - I highly recommend Kevin  You will not regret it and like me will want to do it again.
4094,0,"Ouch & GROSS  Expensive and Disgusting  ""Cal-Ital"" foodHow stupidHonestly I ordered the number one listed and recommended item on the menu seafood carbonara pasta dish and it was absolutely tasteless  It tasted like wallpaper paste  It was surprisingly awful since it is owned by Cowboy Ciao across the street which is very goodFor good carbonara go to Uncle Sal's - formerly mafia owned by Sammy ""The Bull"" Gravano  I choose good food over decore anytime."
2183,1,Love this little park for hikes and walks It's quiet well kept and beautiful For the most part the hikes are all easy without much elevation gain Tons of cactus and open views creating a nice calm If you live in the area I highly recommend this park for hikes If you don't live in the area there are probably closer hikes to you with free admission (this park is $6) and it may not be totally worth the drive.

3358,0,"2nd time I've used this location to cater our monthy Directors' Meeting  The first time they said they'd deliver (because they're only a block away) and the food did not show up at the agreed-upon time  They called me an hour later asking me why I hadn't come to the restaurant to pick up the food  I told them that the Manager had specifically agreed (to my face) to deliver--again because we're only a block away  45 minutes AFTER THAT the food showed up  Yesterday I placed my order for this month's meeting today and told them that I'd pick up the food at 12:30  Arrived at 12:30 and they hadn't even started the order  The cashier asks the cook what is going on and (big mistake shithead) he decides to angrily yell his response in Spanish across the kitchen in front of the ""Stupid Gringo"" that he hasn't started it yet because it isn't due until 12:30  He seemed quite shocked when the Stupid Gringo (who speaks fluent Spanish) answered him IN SPANISH in a less-than-pleasant fashion that it WAS 12:30 PM  Still did not have my food 10 minutes later  The Manager/Shift Supervisor decides to tell me in English that they're having a problem  I respond in Spanish confused as to which language he and his staff should be using in front of customers (particularly because this idiot cook obviously understood English perfectly) asking why he can't deliver my food on time when I specifically confirmed this order well over 24 hours in advance  No comp no price reduction nothing  Will NEVER be eating here AGAIN  I agree with the other reviews regarding service--and while you're at it probably should lose the angry vibe that permeates the kitchen  Particularly when you just never know who can speak Spanish  And it's absolutely unprofessional and insulting to purposely speak another language in front of your customers when you actually do have a command of English."

145,1,The White Chocolate Grill is a great place to meet friends for a dinner and a drink   I love the decor of the restaurant  The menu is unique and the food is unbelievable  ( It can get a little loud when it's busy ).
2156,0,Surprised this place isn't closed by now Went here once when I first started going to ASU and never came backTheir ingredients are not fresh gyro meat tastes old and decrepit They really need to hire better pita makers who don't resemble drug addicts and derelicts My pita was falling apart before it was even handed to me Literally by the time I got it to the table it was soggy and not even worth eating.
2103,1,So my cousin and I decided to get tattoos in memory of our kick ass Aunt Leslie  My cousin is from Michigan and I am from Napa Ca  We were here for a short time  We found Lucky Lady Tattoo and immediately knew this is the place we should go because of the women artists  We called and Marge set our appointment for the next day the last day we were both going to be in Phoenix  When we walked in the shop we were instantly calmed by the decor very laid back  Marge proceeded with much care and caution  While I knew exactly what I wanted my cousin needed a little time to decide  Marge listened sketched colored edited with sooo much patience Marge's work was quick and beautiful By the time we left not only did we have exactly the art work we wanted but we felt like we gained a friend Thank you so much Marge.
3529,0,I'm literally writing this review at 2:45 am from my room at Zona Suites and Resorts  I would rather be asleep but alas sleep will not be what I am getting tonight  Aside from the bed feeling like a padded half pipe (can't keep from rolling into the center) the noise that you hear inside your room is insane  There are a group of people by the pool They aren't being obnoxious or loud so it doesn't warrant a call to the front desk - but you can literally hear every word  Plus half of the group is in the room above ours so every trip up and down the stairs is heard loud and clear  I would have gladly transferred to a different room (even at 2:45am) but I was told at check in that they were 100% full tonight and I could not get a room on the 3rd floor as I desired  The grounds are pretty - perhaps I should go walk around since it is clear I won't be getting any sleep.
3006,1,Best diavola EVER I would recommend this pizzeria to anyone it won't disappoint.
2757,1,The sandwiches here are fresh tasty and cheap The Baguettes are made on site and you notice it The sliced peppers in the sandwiches are a bit spicy but that makes them better in my opinionThis is a place for a quick bit It feels a bit industrial noisy and busy However they seem to be very efficient and the restaurant is extremely clean It is cash only but that shouldn't be a problem since the prices are so cheapAlso try the spring rolls mniam mniam.
3207,0,We had a private party scheduled for the 3-course chef tasting dinner  The room was not ready the menu was not as we discussed (there were meat dishes and we had a few vegetarians) the A/V equipment didn't work   One of the guests also got a cup of coffee that tasted like chicken broththe owner came back with some excuse for this but the issue was not corrected  We all had been looking forward to this dinner for some time now since we heard good things about this restaurant - this bad experience was enough for me not to return.
2977,1,I went to Chirofit after a car accident and it was the best thing that I could have done Dr Stamp was awesome and really got my body back into shape please forgive the pun The office staff is very nice and is really on top of things I'd definitely recommend the Peoria AZ locationThe ONLY thing I was a little worried about (and not enough to take a star away) was that they are attached to a Gold's Gym Never ONCE was I approached or pressured to join the gym.

2867,1,"Davanti Enoteca joins the very small group of restaurants serving fine food in attractive surroundings at reasonable (sort of ) prices  The cuisine is certainly Italian but not like what you would find in a traditional Italian establishment -- this is more like what you would expect in one of the trendy restaurants in Bologna  For example: there is a bruscheta on the menu but there are also four ""Vasi""s which are more inventive dips served with toasted Italian bread  We had the cannelloni (bean) and onion variety (the beans were pureed and you spread it over the bread)Davanti serves ""sharing"" style meaning that dishes come out one or two at a time and the table is assumed to be sharing them  If you and your companion each order an entree they may not come out at the same time  This presents Davanti with a challenge in pacing the meal -- but they manage to keep the food flowing without having dishes pile up at any one time  It also gives you a lot of changes to interact with your dining companionsThree of the five dishes we ordered were five star and the other two still pretty good  I think the pizzas are there least successful offerings -- perhaps they don't have the right oven and so the crust is chewy not crispy  The faro salad was spectacular  The asparagus came with tiny bits of rhubarb -- nice touch  And the chocolate budino dessert was right on target: a not-overly-rich chocoate mousse/pudding with toasted marshmallowAs a wine bar Davanti has a good selection of wines by the glass and both of the ones we had were outstanding  The wines are not cheap at about $10 a glass but the pour is generous and you can get larger pours for slightly more  The food dishes run from around $7 to $13 and two per person is sufficient so the total for us was under $100 for two including tax and tipTwo suggestions:1  Reservations on weekends are probably needed2  Build you meal from the starters -- vasis boards appetizers and salads and then add a pasta or pizza  You don't need to emphasize the ""main courses""."

1194,1,Thanks to the tips from other Yelpers we rolled right up to the unmarked double doors Hidden next to a coffee bar is little gem of a restaurantand I mean little My boyfriend and I got there around 7 on a Saturday night and shared a large table with another group We loved the ambiance and their no nonsense attitude and the food does not disappoint We started with a bowl of posole then I got the sea bass special and he got the gumbo It would seem that everything on the menu is ridiculously fabulous We will definitely make this a regular spot for us.

1011,1,After reading the thread about holiday giving I realized I had not reviewed Kidstop  The only kid I know is my nephew and I don't see him that often so I'm always at a loss as to what to buy him  Since it seems he has everything imaginable his parents are useless resources  Hmmm  That's an interesting contradiction in terms isn't itKidstop saves the day every time  They offer a huge selection of both educational and creative toys for kids of all ages  Lots of the standards like games trains planes and dolls but they also have more educational things like science kits and erector sets  I just found some cool stilts and parachute men last time too  My husband was sorely disappointed with our last visit however  Although they still sell the parts they took down the Rokenbok display  Now he has to shop like an adultSo what did we buy this year  A radio-controlled airplane that can be used in the house  That one is for his parents to lament over  And a magician's set of card tricks  I'm pretty sure he's a little scheister in the making.

3736,0,"Just went there recently and I honestly thought the place was closed and getting ready to move because it was super cluttered knick knacks everywhere and a stench of mold that was only slightly tolerable The people were nice but I did still get a Silence of the Lambs vibe from them enough for me to choose a table farthest from them They also charged me an extra $200 for using a card to pay for a $370 drink and did not inform me that would happen To give them the benefit of the doubt we'll assume there was a sign that I happened to not see that informs patrons of this By the time my friend arrived I had already sent her a text that said ""Pretty sure these people are going to skin me alive"" My friend wanted to order a burger from them but like other people mentioned I strongly question the uphold of health codes in the joint We left and actually went to Panda Express because even that was a step above the Coffee Cove."

3626,0,I drove from Prescott to try this place  I was going to be in Phoenix that day and needed to try something other than my usual DDD place Chino Bandido  Let me start by saying that I love Guy's suggestions for the most part  Salsa Brava in Flagstaff is excellent  Everything Guy described and more  The same goes for Chino Bandido in Phoenix it's just as he described  I tried Roberto's at the gas station that was also highlighted on DDD  It's slightly better than Los Taquitos  First off Los Taquitos had no fountain soda it was out of order I ordered the 3 taco plate because the atmosphere was questionable  The place wasn't as clean as I would like so I wanted to order safe  My husband ordered the relleno plate  My taco shells were burnt  His relleno was soggy  The only good part was the rice and beans  I didn't see any chips and salsa on the menu either  The bathroom was pretty bad too  The floor was filthy and there was a hole in the wall that was stuffed with tp Don't get me wrong I can slum it for some great authentic food but I don't see the appeal of Los Taquitos  I felt ripped off and regret going.
1801,0,I recently visited the David's Bridal Paradise Valley store while visiting my future in-laws after Christmas My future mother-in-law really wanted to be involved in the dress shopping experience so I thought I would make my first shopping trip while visiting her My future sister-in-law was in town too so I thought it would be a nice chance for her to be involved too I didn't expect to find my dress as I am SUPER picky and it has taken me MONTHS to find dresses for things before My wedding isn't until October so I had 10 months and wasn't too worried When I called to make the reservation for an appt at the Scottsdale store I was diverted to the Paradise Valley store as the Scottsdale location was under renovation Not a big deal as the PV store is only 20 min away I had a terrible experience with Sierra at the PV store They had warned me that the she would have another client and I had informed my future mother-in-law and my aunt of this as well It took her about 20 minutes to come greet me at the front of the store I didn't try on my first dress until I was 45 minutes into the appointment Sierra had pulled dresses for me but I was standing there in the slip and corset top they had me put on for 10 minutes before I gave up on waiting for her and had my aunt help me into the first dress It was a Vera Wang I had been interested in but I looked like a cream puff (not David's Bridal or Sierra's fault just not a good look for me) I tried on only one of the other dresses Sierra had brought out of the 4 because I didn't like the dresses she pulled I kept waiting for her to help me however Sierra barely ever came back She only seemed to come back when she was requested and only helped me in and out of one dressI had told her exactly what I didn't want and she kept bringing stuff that had things I didn't want She was VERY NICE VERY PROFESSIONAL and handled my relatives without getting frustrated However they were frustrated with her My future mother-in-law had to pull a lot of the dresses and most of her pulls were ones I actually liked Most of Sierra's pulls were ones I did not She pulled some silhouettes that were nice but nothing that wowed me or really impressed meThe dressing room wasn't big enough for the dress much less the dress and two people The store itself looked unimpressive Sierra just was not a good match for me They didn't have the Melissa Sweet line which was my fav dress when looking through magazines but Sierra told me the Scottsdale store had the line but probably not the dress She didn't take the 2 minutes out to call and check for me but I did  They had it and accommodated a walk-in The Scottsdale store set me up with Alison and she was amazing Even though she too had another client she made me feel like her only client and she was SO sweet and nice I really appreciated her and everything she did for me Because of Alison I found my dress (turns out the Melissa Sweet I loved wasn't it either) and I ACTUALLY feel like a bride now  I recommend going to the Scottsdale Fashion Square store EVEN IF THE Paradise Valley store is closer The rooms are bigger nicer and the seating is more comfortable for your family They have mirrors IN THE ROOMS and the selection is much nicer The store appears smaller than the PV store but it is SO MUCH nicer than the PV store Trust me you won't regret skipping PV and going straight to Scottsdale  (Ask for Alison too :)).
6,1,I love Stereo Joe I had bought a new radio thinking I could install it myself That was a disaster I went to Joe and it did it cheaply and quickly He is also the nicest guy I felt really good about supporting this small business Joe is a great guy and very helpful  When he installed my radio he also fixed my broken car clicker at no extra charge Wow  I felt like he genuinely cared about helping me more than he cared about my money.
609,1,I used to play on a Coed indoor soccer team that was sponsered by this bar and that is when I started to go here If you are into authentic Irish bars then you absolutely must stop in It is in a kind of hidden corner but once you walk in you will realize how charming it is Even the bartender is actually Irish They have $3 Carlsberg all day every day and other great Irish beers and ciders on tap As far as food goes I have only had their fish and chips but it was delicious We stopped in last Saturday night because they are the only Official US Soccer bar in Arizona and we wanted to watch the game We were pleasantly surprised with the live music they had that night It was really great and I think we will be going more often now.
4781,0,What a lousy experience  I went in to get a hair cut  They don't take appointments but you can put your name on a list  The bad thing is that if you're sitting there waiting the people on the list can come back ANYTIME they want and get in front of those who have been waiting  I expressed my dissatisfaction about that and one of the stylists (Grace) thought it was funny  Nice  Suffice it to say I won't be going back here.
1599,1,We just moved to Mesa and received one of those door hanger thingy's advertising this place We ordered the philly cheese steak pizza and it was amaaaaaazingIt was delivered to us on time and was really reasonably pricedWe can't wait to order from them again (and try a different pizza each time).
118,1,Order any of the Eggs Benedict and you will not be disappointed I couldn't eat them fast enough Gets very busy on Sunday mornings during brunch time so be prepared to wait It is worth it you will have cravings for the eggs Benedict.
2146,1,In Phoenix for a business meeting and loaded the food network app to find a diners drive ins and dives This place was first on the list What a gem to find Hands down the best tacos I've ever eaten Taco Tuesday so I got the el pastor The salsas were awesome and the heat was felt for hours Just like I like it I would highly recommend this place to anyone looking for a taco fix Too bad that they aren't located in my home town because I would be there every day.
3296,0,"What closes early on a Friday night in Scottsdale DD does  Without knowing it we went there later in the night not knowing what time they close-9pm  We weren't really greeted by a hello or welcome but more like look at their watch and a sigh  We said sorry ""Can we still come in or not it's ok"" They still sat us And we waited and waited never greeted or acknowledged Waiters racing back and forth never looking our way  The place was full so not sure if this was their way to get rid of us  Five minutes later  we had to ask for our waitress which the one that seated us raced by our table several times ignoring us all together  The only person that served us was the bartender   She was the only bright person in the entire place We ordered two drinks and the portobello and brie fondue plate  Drinks were great  The dish on the other hand was a bowl of what looked like soup pieces of bread and badly cut pieces of tomatoes cucumbers and carrots None of the plate really looked good but we ate it Very salty fondue Not enough bread Wasn't impressed  Oh and there were typos in the menu."

3531,0,If the previous owners are still in town I wonder if it makes them sad to see what happened to their specialty concept If you went to the original in Tempe or Ahwatukee (before they closed it in the early 90's) you could tell that their little gem would flourish in a larger space with some appropriate decor and ambiance specialty coffees etc Sadly while these changes were made by the new owners 5 or so years ago the quality of the product went downhill and the prices went up I recently tried a breakfast croissant again and I'd swear the croissant came from Costcoit was that mediocre Gone is the delicate blend of overnight proofed crispy exterior with layers of tender inner croissant I bought a filled croissant for later and it was so disappointing I'm embarrassed I let my taste buds down this way I've tried going back several times over the last few years I want to like them I want to support them but they are overpriced and underwhelmingI wont go back againIf you never went to the original owners' Pleassant Croissant and think P Croissant is greatcontinue to live in blissful ignorance I on the other hand mourn the loss of the father and son that delivered the original delicate delights that were worthy of praise and their price.

1361,0,This place did not deserve a $100 nevermind the $75 they charged for 2 mani/pedis They barely rub your feet legs They cut me and my husband many times while doing a manicure They are NOT friendly at all The woman next to my husband had her cell phone and items on the little table and the nail tech knocked into them knocking them to the floor and the nail tech laughed and didn't even say sorry The woman was really upset as I would have been At the end I decided to tip but not even close to what we normally would tip of course The nail tech had the nerve to count the money in front of us and then look at us with a dirty look REALLY You are lucky you got ANYTHING AWFUL & A WASTE OF MONEY.
1163,1,"My son absolutely loves this place (I do too)He said ""tigers blood is the most best flavor I think"" You can get a mini sno ball for 75 cents which is perfect for the little ones I'll admit that the owner can be a little ""cold"" but he has passion for his product and knows his stuff."

1645,0,I hate dealing with this bank  I've never liked their predatory lending practices and everything is a hassle the wait times are always awful  I would rather have dental work than to continue doing business with these people The final straw with these idiots was today  Wells Fargo issued me a refund check for $2700 in the form of a cashier's check for an overpayment I made  I went to this branch and besides waiting in the usual horrendous line because they have 2 people working the teller counter I was forced to wait 25 minutes for them validate their own check  They had to call a number of people to make sure my $27 was cleared  At one point the manager came out who didn't bother to apologize for making me stand there at the teller counter for 25 minutes while they fumbled with researching their own checkWells Fargo -- fumble with your back office shenanigans on your own time  I don't want to wait for 25 minutes to deposit a check into my own account  At least they didn't try to sell me anything this time I suppose I should be grateful for that.

4357,0,I've gotta agree with Jesse on the only other review  HOW IS THIS GYM STILL IN BUSINESSThe manager is your classic gym jackass that makes people who work at gyms look bad  Pushy dishonest gym membership sales  I've seen a personal trainer and the manager ogle girls rarely see them doing any workA few of the front desk staff were cool  Just very underpaid and obviously passing throughThe men's locker room is disgusting  No joke more than half the equipment is broken or has something wrong with itI do believe about 80% of the problem is with the manager  A quick renovation and new management could do wonders for this spotWhy did I keep going  Convenience and locked into a 1 year employee benefit type membership  I visited the gym about 40 times over 5 months while I was recovering from injury and at least it has a pool 2 large jacuzzis (jet therapy) steam room and free weightswhen they are operable  I can't tell you how many times I've seen customers waiting out front with no one out at the front deskOne Sunday morning no one on staff bothered to show up to open the gym  I eventually just left after 45 minutes who knows when they finally showed up  I saw about 40 members either waiting or came and leftWorst Gym (Management) Ever.
1526,1,Peter and his crew put out the best Chinese food in the valley.
646,1,My buddy and I were looking for a late night option last night (around 9:30) and stumbled across this place thanks to my handy dandy Yelp app  We were seated outside which was lovely and we got the bruschetta (the one with pancetta and mushrooms was ridic)  Then we got some of their tomato bisque soup and the Italian flatbread  I wasn't crazy about the tuna or the salmon options on the bruschetta but almost everything else was spot on  Yes we dunked the flatbread in the soup - and it was idealGreat service great ambiance and right across the street from Paleta's Betty - which consequently has the best popsicle EVER (the orange creamsicle)  All in all it was a great night and I look forward to going back and trying their entrees.
1199,1,Great food Clean Top notch service People are always friendly and seem happy to be there.
1802,1,Loooove this place Yes it's pricey but good sushi usually is The guys making the rolls were friendly The atmosphere is nice Hubby absolutely loved the quail eggs and I couldn't get enough of the spicy shrimp roll Seriously try it You won't be disappointed.
1719,0,It was alright I was there with real good peeps so it made all the difference Food was pretty good Wings were grilled and kind of different However i MUST say they forgot Shrimp in my friends shrimp-something-pasta-special I mean C'mon We did get free desert out of this and of cuz they replaced his dish My own Miso Salmon was not bad but i think rice it came with was super buttered up but tasted good And all food came out blazing fast too What i was really bummed about that my Mojito as basically lemony water I sent it back 2x till 3rd one was ok JUST OK I did get charged 2x for this though and did not feel like making a scene being with friends and all I did not come there for a crowd but there we some girls in tight jeans there and some dudes and some couples I do not care much What is unacceptable is that Bar/Tavern has watered down drinks That is BAD I mean B A D  I am not a picky person but this is BS pardon my English AND i ended up paying 2x for this water Bleah doubt i will be backEDIT: I thought about it compared to my other experiences i had at some other similar joints and i am bumping this one down a notch Sorry The Vig get your act together Swanky decor aint cutting itEugene.
4631,0,I was here once a few years ago and was stoked to try a new breakfast place since I was staying downtown all weekend Last time I thought I remember enjoying it but this time not so much First of all I am going to say that I went there Saturday at 9:30AM and again Sunday at 8:15AM Saturday was obviously better for meSaturday we a had pretty cool waiter who was attentive enough but I bet it was because he had other tables nearby so we were easier to wave him over I got the Chickichanga which I loved (got it both mornings) but I was annoyed that the onions I asked them to hold was throughout my meal I could barely taste them and was on a schedule so I didn't complain My colleague asked for no spinach in her egg skillet and it was throughout You cannot miss huge spinach leaves laid through an egg and cheese skillet She didn't say anything and just ate it The coffee was just ok the prices were a little high and the selection was limiting The ice tea was good though and they gave us a to go cup Not bad Got them a 3Then I come to Sunday My wife 4 year old and I went there There was literally ONLY two other tables of customers We were seated by someone who looked like a host or manager but then it was 10 minutes before anyone bothered coming over I finally went found her and asked for coffee I figured she'd come right over She walked in the back talked to someone else and then a few minutes later a lady ran over with a coffee carafe She filled us up and didn't bother asking if my child wanted or needed anything She left I had to go find someone to order a drink after 5 minutes later for my childThe same lady came back and I asked her her name (I don't remember now) and she said America is my server but she was helping her out (why America had ONE other table) We ordered my kid some milk and then our food After 15 minutes I went to find out where the hell my kid's milk was America brought it right over and also an extra water then she disappeared without asking if we needed anything else At this point there was 3 server staff (America the other hispanic lady and a guy) and only TWO tables (the place is not large I could see all of the tables from mine) Fifteen minutes later we got our meals I got the same meal as the day before because I knew what to expect This time no onions which was good We ate paid almost $30 for three of us (my kid ONLY got toast) and got the heck out of there I will not be back.
4716,0,Stay away from this business  They are dishonest  Do not drop your clothes off here donate them to charity  They can not account for items dropped off and then soldRepeated attempts the resolve the problem have ended in frustration  We will be reporting them to the BBB  Do everyone a favor and go elsewhere.
3159,0,Boo Not a fan of the food at all Customer service was good & prices were ok.
2203,1,Literally the most delicious food ever & the comforting cottage style ambiance tops it off I definitely suggest trying the bree appetizer & the Cobb salad is a perfect choice for any hungry tummy.
1746,1,"There is not much more I can say that has not been said by previous Yelpers This place is just plain awesome We went to St Francis with another couple for dinner and we all just loved this place The open air dining room lemonade cocktail cauliflower & curry soup the pot roast on Texas toast the service - all five star and I wasn't blown away by the check Mmm I am salivating for more of the soup as I sit St Francis will the first place I think of when I want to ""show off"" the culinary options of Phoenix to visitors."

2092,1,Fast service seat yourself Got drinks right away and ordered food right away Place is nice and modern feeling Smells good Place has a patio and a bar Best background oldies music Not a fan of jalapeño Mac and cheese but that's just me:) The jalapeño taste is not for me But I'm sure people love it The fries were fantastic I ordered the brisket and it was amazing Wife had the pulled pork sammy and she loved it and almost ordered another Over all good experience we will be back regularly.
2452,1,Simply Awesome .
4761,0,I had one hour for lunch and had heard this was one of the best places in town I expected the lunch combo would come with a cup of soup - but not here even though lunch is hi-priced The weather was cold so I wanted soup I ordered sizzling rice soup and some egg rolls It took 45 minutes between the time I sat down and when I got my food The soup was not sizzling and had small round BURNT rice cakes floating in the cup BURNT BLACK I had ten minutes to eat and get back to the office so I could not return my meal I fished out the burnt pieces and ate quickly Maybe this place had a good rep in the past but I will never go back there.
976,1,WowWe have enjoyed this place when it was mobile mainly at the Scottsdale Farmer's Mkt But it appears that when the wheels fell off the truck rather than calling triple AAA they simply set up shop with some bricks and a lil' mortarThe nutella-banana crepe was as good as I remember but the star was the breakfast burritoThis burrito is now the benchmark as to which all breakfast burritos will be comparedThe crepe takes the place of the ol' flour tortilla and boy what an upgrade The crepe was super delicious on its own but then when you add fluffy eggums and mexican cheese and whatnot man I wanted to order a second one Also the latte's were delightfulWe are sure to be back :).
3556,0,I was so excited to go here after reading all the reviews but afterwards wondered if I really had the right place or if it was an off day last Sunday My experience was very different We went for a late breakfast It's best if I summarize my plate The eggs that I ordered over hard had broken and it was hard to even see the yolks mixed in as they were The hamburger patty was the driest least appetizing I've ever had and even the pancakes were heavy flat without any taste or salt I thought it would be hard to mess up these basics but you learn something new every day The service was nothing exceptional  I thought the place would have some charm but there was nothing - just an ordinary diner It's actually kind of sad when you enjoy the toast with jam more than anything else Never again It may be cheap but IMO it's misplaced economics to pay anything for something so disappointing.
4687,0,Second time here and equally disappointed as the first time Food is tasteless service is so-so and I find the prices to be excessive This is really a very touristy place to go in Cave Creek If you want great Mexican in Scottsdale go to Los Sombreros a family owned authentic place on Scottsdale Rd.
4816,0,"This is going to be brutal  Hide the childrenIf you've been to Chipotle you'll feel right at home at Qdoba That is until you start eating Complete and utter ripoff of the concept except for the part that matters - the execution  Where Chipotle succeeds Qdoba fails miserably  The ingredients are orders of magnitude shittier  The burritos are just plain bad  My burrito was loaded with rice and beans and very little meat - basically the opposite of what you'll get at the ""other"" place  On top of that the rice and beans were the suck  And if you know Brak you know that he LOVES his beans  But not these  About all they're good for is a massive bean fart shortly after ingesting this crapIf you want to know the root cause of this debacle check out who the parent company is - it's Jack In The Crack®  Pretty much explains it allAvoid at all costs  Receives Brak's dreaded zero-star review rounded up to 1 because Yelp doesn't allow a zero."
3774,0,"I don't think this place even deserves a single star I used to go here but had a couple of terrible experiences the last times I was there They used to be 'okay' but then they hired some new pharmacists that were totally rude and stuck up I went in there in a lot of pain from a recent dentist appointment The young girl at the counter didn't even greet me she just took my prescription looked at it rolled her eyes and walked away 10 minutes later she came back without having said anything else and tells me ""We don't have this"" Why the hell would it take you that long to figure that out Why were you so rude Why didn't you have the medicine I needed This place sucks and their employees have really sucky attitudes Stay away from this place."

2006,1,After seeing all the good reviews of this place on here my girlfriend and I decided to give this place a try She ordered the veggie roll and I tried the What The Heck roll The presentation was very good and both of our rolls were simply delicious we'll definitely be coming back.
1171,1,"Went here to celebrate my birthday with some of my hot babe friends which happened to be cinco de mayo  Rachel was our bartender/server  She is very friendly and helpful  We asked for her recommendations as to what was popular and good  There was seven of us so we had an opportunity to try quite a few items on the menu   We ordered the fried sausage ravioli the coconut chicken tenders the chicken lettuce wraps tempura vegetable medley and the chef's sliders all from the appetizer menu  We also tried the mac 'n cheese with bacon and the pork chop dinner  She makes a great French martini  I must admit I didn't like the margarita  I guess it's cause I don't like it with ice and I like more salt on the rim but probably my fault since I didn't tell her I didn't want it on ice  Everything was fabulous but if you're going to order anything absolutely a must is the mac 'n cheese with the bacon  The bacon really adds to it  And the pork dinner had the right amount of ""gravy""  I don't know if I could even call it gravy but we were practically licking the plates of the mac 'n cheese and the pork  I really liked the ravioli and the sliders  Since I'm not all that big on fried food all I can say is that they were good for fried food but it wouldn't be something I personally would order  But that's me  Just like I wouldn't order lamb but we won't go there  I'd absolutely return  reBAR is across the patio and is the bar  We dropped in there to see what it looked like."

3016,0,"This is in response to the condescending owner of Genghis Grill  Unfortunely for you I'm a bit more educated than your average diner  I am a registered dietitian and I am smart enough to know the your comments on my initial review are misleading to your other customers  First off I have a 30 minute lunch break therefore I dont have time to drive to your restaurant and sit there for 45 minutes  But I understand many people have 1 hour lunch breaks and they may have time for your restaurant  This is why I chose YC's because I can get in and out of there on my time scheduleYour goober sauces are more unhealthy than most sauces with the consistancy of water  The only way sauces get that thick consistency is being made with excessive sugar and/or fat just like BBQ sauce and mayo  Anyone who knows anything about nutrition and asian dishes should know that ""Kung Pao"" sauce is one of the most calorically dense sauces  This goes for any asian restaurant not just YC's- along with other thick sauces like General Tso and Sweet & Sour  I could really care less about these YC's recipes considering I always make my own as many people do   I do not want a place that pre-makes the sauces for meYour comparison is clearly ridiculous considering the portion size you are comparing must be dramatically different  YC's does not specify a serving size  Neither do you  Genghis Grill Serving Size = 05 1 or 2  What does this mean g oz tsp tbs cup  Not exactly what I'd call legitimate   YC's charges 50 cents for a take-out box not $1  I was charged 999 for lunch on a weekday for a to-go order  So if your lunch is supposed to cost 899 well then you do the mathYou only solidified my decision to NEVER GO BACK with your rude response  I have only ever rated a restaurant with 1 star twice  I usually rate generously  My initial review was my honest opinion  I had nothing against Genhis Grill- it just wasn't for me  Now that you have responded this way- I will now go to the extent to letting friends and coworkers about the situation  I'm sure you will stay busy but I will not be visiting again."

4676,0,Do not go to this restaurant I bought 4 ceviche tostadas for 15 dollars and they charged me 150 dollars  After that they charged me 15 dollars more because they made a wrong calculation the first time  Don Poncho pretended to give me a refund electronically and gave me a fake receipt  When I checked my balanced I was missing 150+ dollars from my checking account  Called Don Poncho and told me that he did not know how to work the system and refused to give me back my money  He never acknowledge that I was going to be missing 150 dollars from my checking account and was very reluctant to admit it and NEVER EVER APOLIGIZED  I was charged an overdraft fee from my bank and Mr Poncho said that was not his problema Very RUDE He pretended not to know what was going on and told me to go ahead and call the police He told me to bring back my checking card so he could deduct another 150 dollars from my own account which made no sense to me whatsoever He said he did not want to refund me on the spot and this is what business usually do give you a refund  He also refused to refund me the 15 dollars for the tostadas even though I wasted 5 hours trying to get my money back and I still do not have it DO NOT EAT HERE.
376,1,This place is great On our 3 day trip we came in twice and would have come back on our way to the airport but our car was running late The juices are amazing and fresh and after seeing the food come out the first day we were back the next to try it  The breakfast sandwich with fresh arugula ham and cheese topped with two over easy eggs was a perfect way to start the day My husband raved about the tri-tip sandwich too We will be back every time we visit Scottsdale and will miss it until then.

3377,0,I've given this place numerous chances but I just don't think I'll be coming backThough you can find some gems scattered throughout the store the cleanliness and selection of items are probably the poorest of the asian markets in the city Depending on what you're looking for there is either a huge selection or extremely slim During today's visit I noticed black mold below the packaged sausage in the refrigerator There was a dead frog just chilling with a bunch of other alive frogs smushed up against the glass I've never been to an asian market where the people serving you wear rubber cleaning gloves while handling your money and groceriesThere are definitely cleaner asian markets with better selections.
1366,0,"If I never want to sit in a Chili's for 3 hours I won't go to this location anymore Only 3 of us 2 adults 1 preteen and he's very hungry boy who loves Chili's and knows exactly what he wants The waiter was thought he know better what we should have and not in a helpful way Our boy ordered his usual hot wings and when we asked if he wanted anything else the waiter butted in and said ""Oh you'll have plenty to eat"" Well he's old enough to know how much he can eat with no help from the staff Then he told us we needed cocktails Uh no we wanted sodas/tea He never noticed we only had 2 place settings even when we finally got our appetizer (messy) so we shared forks and napkins I walked around trying to find some sugar for my iced tea and after I asked for some it was awhile until I got it We then sat and watched 3 new tables order and get their meal while we waited It seriously wasn't anymore busy for our waiter then the others We finally received our meal and the waiter was surprised we asked if our son could have some silverware/napkins with his meal it barely made it on our table as he flew past with it Our drinks were empty before we got our meal (HUGE deal for me) but we eventually got refills When done our son wanted his usual cheesecake We had to nearly beg the waiter to let us order him dessert (he's 12) and then he was made to feel bad when the waiter just couldn't believe he didn't want the hot pan cookie/icream thing He's had the darn thing before  Then as we watched more tables come and go we finally got our check THEN waited for the guy to take the money I had to actually make it super visible since he didn't get the hint when the tray sat at the edge of the table forever Then he came over complaining about ""Women"" and something about seeing the movie ""The Hobbit"" as he then went on to tell us he owed us $70  Hello I'm a woman and I want to see the movie  I would have paid $770 to get the heck out of there  Went in the bathroom and toilets were unflushed and the silk flowers had long term dust on them ICK  I do have to say the food was good though Also hot so at least we got that part."

3856,0,While I do not eat fast food as much I used to I used to eat at Jack in the Box (different locations) all of the time  I was on my way home recently from playing sports and had a hankering for a sourdough jack (my favorite) and some jalapeno poppers  My girlfriend was with me and decided to try the sirloin burger  What a disasterWe were exhausted and live close by so we went straight home after hitting the drive through only to find out that we did not receive the poppers that we paid for  On top of that the burgers were sub par and the fries were burnt (a shame because they were curly fries)  I had not eaten at JITB in quite some time and this experience has solidified why I had stopped going in the first place  Perhaps I should have checked the bag before leaving the drive through but when there are only a couple of cars in the drive through and no one in the restaurant should I really have to  Especially at 10pm when things are slow  I will not be returning to this location and more than likely will not return to any others either  It is a shame because the food used to be so good.

2631,1,I have come here religiously for the past 4 years (every 2 weeks) and have never been disappointed  Every nail artist in the salon is amazing and they have the best service  The prices for N Scottsdale are very decent  I love the spa pedicure (with the sea salt and the french)  Super clean with new tools on each client  They recently expanded so they have twice the space - their massage chairs are amazing  And even down to the spa owner's little daughter who helps take your money on occasion  It's definitely a family atmosphere here  I bring my mom girlfriends sisters here whenever they are in town  A nice treat for such a great price.
4875,0,The worst public golf I've ever experienced in the many years I've been golfing with friends We were approached on the 2nd hole on a Saturday morning and told that we had to play ready-ball It wasn't that busy so no need at all to be interrupted and hassled on several holes The only reason my game got slowed down was because this Steve guy was watching us (distracting us) on every hole and asking for our receipts twice Steve later on apologized but when I told him I wanted a refund he never did anything  We had to skip the putting portion on several holes to get him off out backs I didn't get what I paid for.
273,0,The food wasn't good mostly fried tofu options instead of healthy vegan options Atmosphere: felt like being recruited for a cult The video playing on the tv was a very strange homage to the Supreme Master a woman who runs a big tv/internet religion that also runs this chain of restaurants If the food was good maybe it'd be easier to tune out but nothing was good about this experience.

2351,1,The selection and service of this store is amazing  I made two trips into the store  First to look at the appliances second to verify and order  The staff is very knowledgeable and I felt absolutely no pressure to buy  Before my purchase the installers came out to verify the opening sizes to see if modifications had to be made  Once I had selected all of my new appliances our installation was scheduled  The installers did have to modify our existing openings but they did an excellent job  Our granite had to be cut on the sides as well as the oven opening  One installer cut the other ran two vacuums to minimize the dust  Excellent job  I am very impressed with the entire experience with Best Home Appliances.

1373,1,Does this restaurant get five stars because of it's ambiance food or great service  No  Don't get me wrong it was great food at a decent price but this review is slightly biasedSince work sent me out to Arizona for the weekend I got to see my brother who I only see a few times a year  It's weird as you get older the family that you wanted to get away from to become an individual is the one that you want to get closer and closer to  Though I had to fly out to Phoenix Saturday morning do some work then drive out to Sierra Vista early Sunday do some work and drive back to Phoenix the same day (Sierra Vista is about 3 hours away from Phoenix) I would do it all over again just to spend some time with himI did remind him that he gave me dog poop and told me it was chocolate when I was a kid though  That I'll never forget.

1477,0,Why oh why do I keep giving Honey Bears a chance  We were about to go to Happs' for lunch and for some reason I suggested Honey Bears  Now Happs' is not great BBQ but I am still regretting my decision to skip them today  My coworker called Honey Bears an 85  85So what is wrong with Honey Bears  Well here it is in a nutshell: $11 for an extremely greasy pulled pork sandwich some beans and a bad fountain root beer  I opened my sandwich up no more than 30 seconds after it was wrapped and the entire bottom half of the bun was so soaked that half the meat came out during my futile attempt to pick it upThe beans well they were pretty good  I've already mentioned the root beer thoughOne of my coworkers got the sliders and they also had that soaked bun problem and not nearly as much meat as the picture depictedWhen a restaurant has a menu as limited as Honey Bears' they darn well better do a good job on each dish  If the food were reasonably priced I'd say it's the McDonald's of BBQ But you're paying almost as much as you'd pay at Famous Dave's without anywhere near the quality.

1354,1,For vegetarian fare these guys are tops in my books  I've always wanted to eat vegetarian because I knew it was healthy but every vegetarian place I've been to (or every vegetarian recipe I've cooked for that matter) has been very  un-delicious  Green is one of the few places in the valley that I would jump at the chance to eat at with a friend  I've had their Kung Pao with mock chicken and it rivaled well known Kung Pao with real ACTUAL chicken  It was quite satisfyingIt's decor is neo-hippie-weird -- but don't let that scare you  It works with this place And don't forget to ask about save room for and try a Tsoynami (a frozen ice-cream-blizzard-like treat).
1073,0,Grimaldi's has to be the most over-rated pizza in the valley  If you're going for the ambiance and service fine this place is more than adequate  If you're going specifically for pizza and could care less about ambiance this place is a big flop  They obviously think the star of a pizza is the crust  If you agree you will probably like this place  But if you think toppings are the main ingredient and crust secondary DON'T go here or you will be disappointed  The crust is decent crisp and tasty with coal smudges on it which is a good thing I guess but I ordered a simple basic large sausage pizza and the sauce was almost non-existent there was a fine sprinkling of cheese that you really had to look for to make sure that wasn't the bare crust staring up at you and the sausage was equally skimpy with maybe an average of 1 to 1 1/2 crumbles per large slice  If you are a yuppie or like to flock to trendy places this is for you  If you'd rather have a good thin crust pizza with decent toppings go somewhere like Spinato's.

2862,1,I moved to Scottsdale from the east coast at the end of October  At home I took my car for oil changes and everything else to our small town mechanic who knew my Dad for a long time and so I knew that I would be treated fairly  I received great service and I have now taken my car her several time and will continue to do so  One time after I had been pulled over I stopped in to find out if they would sign off on this work order that I had been given by the police and the gentleman was kind enough to sign off and install the licence plate bulb for me and did not charge me a thing  I greatly appreciated his outstanding service and would highly recommend Lightning Lube to anyone.

2931,1,This is a nice cafe with a diverse menu There's indoor or outdoor dining with a view of the famous fountain I ate here with my friend Connie who also posted I ordered the Philly cheesesteak which was great They also gave me a sample of the smokes salmon soup which was very much like it sounds The service was excellent i was impressed Will definitely recommend and go again myself.
1153,1,Great food every time we have been there golf or no golf this is a great destination for a fine meal Doesn't hurt that we can walk there for dinner.
3361,0,"Poor customer service - A friend in Scottsdale recommended The Carwasher - he said they hand wash his car and do a good job  When I pulled in and asked to have my car hand washed they told me ""oh we only do that for certain customers""  Talk about poor customer service  How about ""I'm sorry we don't offer hand washing""  Won't be back."
1392,1,Fun course  You can use every club in the bagin as good of shape if not better than the high dollar courses in Scottsdale  Great place to sneak out of work early to play to get in my golf-fix.
2048,1,I really love this place It never fails to be high quality and delicious My only complaint would be the amount/type of seating but that is just a mere location issue And as far as cheese wiz vs provolone or whatever people use on their cheese steaks I think it's however you prefer it and I know people from Philly that take it both ways.
4118,0,Horrible experience Bridal make-up run-thru was not cleanly Artist Tracy did the application in 15 mins looked noticeably  uneven  They tried to reschedule the up-do run-thru for another day after having the appointment a month in advance Unacceptable treatment with forced opinions onto the bride Blatant attempt at promoting other services at the spa after it was made clear they weren't desired Nail technician who did shellac pedicure was the only positive she did a wonderful job  We were forced to pay for the horrible make-up application which was a poor decision reflective of the management.
606,1,"As soon as I walked into this place my mouth began to water  The aroma in here just cant be beatI ordered the special - 1 16"" pizza with 2 toppings and 30 wings  Pizza toppings were Mushrooms and Onions  I lamented this topping combo but it was what my girlfriend wanted  I got the wings hot also ordered the Calzone sampler to try it outWhen I opened the wing box the steam that rose from the box made my eyes and nose water  It smelled so good I had to eat one right there at the counter  One of the owners told me that the wings are even better if you eat them in house  The next time I am in the area I will try it outI took the pizza home and cracked open the box  The mushrooms were thick and the onions appeared at though they were cut by hand  The sauce was rich and the crust was perfectThe calzones were great as well smothered in marinara sauceThe price was great the people were friendly  The lunch special can't be beat  (2 slices of pizza and a free soda 50 cent refills)Negotiate the construction outside find yourself a parking spot and get this pizza  My only regret was that I had to share it  Next time - its all mine."
1617,1,I took my 2 year old queensland heeler in to be spayed this weekend and didn't really know what to expect as this obviously is not her regular vets office  We were wonderfully surprised by the level of service provided not only by the doctor but by the techs as well Everyone who handled my dog was very friendly and very understanding  They took excellent care of her and didn't charge me an arm and a leg for doing the surgery  For the price I paid here it would've cost over $400 at her vets office and why pay that when you can get the same things done for less without sacrificing your pets health and well being  I would absolutely reccommend this clinic to everyone.
4871,0,Coffee is always lukewarm and today I went thru the drive thru and was asked to pull up and wait for my coffee and waited 15 mins and no coffee I had to go so no coffee I called the store 12 times from 1 - 3 PM and never got anyone to answer the phone I physically went to the store at 3:45 and the manager apologized but offered no compensation for my aggravation 4807855418 is the corporate number.
281,0,Horrible The rice is overcooked and there is no flavor to their food  I have tried this place three times-- never again How can Thai food be so bland.
4817,0,Walked in the door my phone reading 856p and we were turned away stating they were closed Really Sign said they serving at 9p  Other tables with menus in hand and they were willing to let us walk We will never be back  As I write this review my car reads 858p Poor customer service in full display.
3632,0,Let me start by saying I love these candles and think the smells are truly unique I have never visited a store because I usually buy online I decided to go to the store today though to smell the holiday scents in person   On this particular trip I had a coupon for buy 2 small jar candles get 2 free I had never purchased the small jar candles so I asked the woman behind the counter to point out which coupons pertain to this promotion She showed me the small jar candle and proceeded to tell me that this was not a good deal She told me the large candle was the best deal and that the small jar candle wasn't a good price  While I can appreciate her desire to up sale I don't appreciate needing to explain that while I agree with her I am not in the position to spend that much money today I was perfectly happy with buying the 2 smaller candles and getting 2 free I realize the best value is the large jar candles (which I had a coupon for buy 2 get 2 free also) I just couldn't spend that much money today  The trip continued to take a turn for the worst when  I went to check out We had about 5 people in line which wasn't a problem until the computer broke We then spent over 10 minutes listening to the same associate announce that this is not her fault and she can't do anything to fix it If we wanted our candles we would just have to wait Finally she has the machine back up and running She begins to ring everyone up She however is taking the time to comment on how she feels about each and every scent that she rings up After spending more then 25 minutes total in line I had to walk out with no candles You see I was on my lunch hour and didn't have the luxury of waiting 25 minutes to have my basket rang up  So now after spending my entire lunch hour in the store discussing my inability to afford 2 large jar candles at that time waiting in line for the cashier to approve every ones candle choices and hearing how she can't do anything about the computer I left with no candles This was my first experience in a Yankee Candle store and let me be honest it STUNK and it wasn't the candles fault.
193,1,I had always loved In n Out in fact when I lived in Reno years ago before they had In n Out my friends and I would drive 2 hours to Sacramento on a Friday night JUST to get In n Out But since moving to Phoenix I have to say that Five Guys is really awesome They take a little time to get your order ready BECAUSE THEY COOK IT FRESH WHEN YOU ORDER IT In n Out also takes pretty much that long I don't know what kind of grill you work on that defies the laws of physics but it takes a certain amount of time to properly cook meatI would give Five Guys a leg up on In n Out BECAUSE they let you decide what's on the burger to a greater extent they have mushrooms A0 and BACON and the beef just tastes better IMHO The grease is what makes it great If you don't want a burger with grease go buy a Boca burger and choke on it seriously because you don't love food if you think that and certainly don't know what you're talking aboutTheir fries are pretty damn good and actually TASTE like you're eating a potato Which is few and far between TBH So next time you are in the mood for a burger THIS is the spot it's hearty filling perfect amount of a juicy mouthwatering foodgasm :-).
2896,1,You can't go wrong with a Waffle House No matter what type of day your having Waffle House will always put a smile on your face Good food good memories and good people.
3890,0,My husband had the steak sandwich and said it was good  I tasted his garlic fries and they didt have much flavorbut most of all were not real hot and not crispyJust a kind of hardness  Nothing to look at or tempt me to eat moreI had the Kobe burger and will never have another It looked hard and dark and was not juicy at all  Maybe a burger  really should have some fat or they don't know what they aredoing   I never use ketchup but had to drown this burger in it for some flavor  YukI so wish I would have sent it back but our server was so nice  This place is over priced and could take a lesson from Cheesecake Factory where everything is consistently GOOD     Thank God we had a birthday coupon and got a break on the bill  Free chocolate cake that was not moist except for the frosting  Will never go back    We don't care about the beer.
2818,1,Wow This place was amazing It beyond exceeded my expectations The lobster ravioli (homemade) the beef tenderloin and the specialty cocktails are all incredible Oh and the mac-n-cheese was amazing too Please check this place out It's to die for.
4840,0,Awful drinks The beer was extremely watered down and the mixed drinks were horrible Not a place for a group get togethers for lunch before a game.
2584,0,NoNoNoI've had it with this place I gave it several tries I even tried to convince myself that it wasn't THAT bad but it is- The sushi is TOO small Really It looks like a child's version of sushi My god it would take eight rolls to fill meFor the same price I'll keep going to the one restaurant at tempe martkeplace I'll take pretentiousness and overdone japanese furniture over crappy sushi anyday Sigh I wanted to like you Sushi 101 But you're like that boy I dumped in the 10th grade who talked a lot of talk but ended up being a total bore.
4292,0,I'll start by saying that I can enjoy some chain bars I actually really like Dave and Busters as their prices are decent and they have a reverse happy hour Bar Louie is no Dave and Busters though One star and there's a lot of reasons why To begin with there was a wait to get our menus from our server This is a minor hassle and I can understand how this can happen when everyone is new but I feel like an experienced manager with a staff of experienced servers can tackle this issue right from the opening dateBar Louie does not list their drink prices except for wine This is a huge pain If it was just a bar it would be a little more acceptable but for a restaurant menu to not have drink prices is inconsiderate I settled on a Manhattan which was on the specialty drink menu It was good but forgettable I actually had a way better Manhattan at Hanny's that was made with rye and was a lot less Like most corporate bars I have my doubts as to how knowledgeable the bartenders really are The food was very very sub-par and forgettable The one thing they have going is good happy hour prices and on Tuesdays they have $5 burgers I ordered the Backyard BBQ burger which comes with BBQ sauce and onion rings It was just ok nothing memorable and I actually like the ones at Red Robin better (those come with unlimited fries) The boo and I got the pretzel appetizer and this was really lousy Eight bucks for four pretzel sticks fresh out of the microwave served with crappy honey mustard average queso and tasty cinnamon sugar spread You should get more than four sticks when you're paying that much The boo got the Mac and Cheese with chicken AVOID THIS It was basically Velveeta shells and cheese with a couple of pieces of grilled chicken hidden away Flavorless and dull if you're going to do Mac and Cheese at least bake it and make it memorable The real killer was my last drink I thought my Manhattan was a little weak so I ordered an Old Fashioned with Jim Beam Big mistake I received the weakest drink I've ever been served It was literally clear with barely any bourbon The server asked how it was and being the nice guy I am I just nodded and said it was good I should've found the manager and requested another drink This mishap has ruined Bar Louie for me I will go anywhere else for drinks at Tempe MarketplaceThe bill came and I saw that all the martini drinks were $10 a pop Hanny's charges five bucks for an excellent martini made with gin and filled to the brim That price is absurd for what you're getting and to top it off it was seven bucks for a Jim Beam old-fashioned Skip this corporate cookie cutter bar you will not enjoy it If you can check out Four Peaks (excellent prices food and drinks) or Casey Moore's (same as Four Peaks) Hell go to Dave and Busters before you come here they at least have reverse happy hour I really really wanted to like Bar Louie I love the idea of having drinks before a flick but this place clearly doesn't have their act together.
1762,1,"Have been taking my son here for almost 2 years and he LOVES it They have everything from gym classes to art and music classes During a lot of the year they have ""unlimited months"" so you can go however much you want So convenient clean & the staff is great If you have a son or daughter you need to try it out they are always running specials :)."
3295,0,"At a recent visit to Sourdough Pizza we had a bad experience It started off with the sad looking and very nasty tasting non-edible want to be Philly Cheese steak sandwiches They were frozen steak-um which starts off insulting Philly The want to be beef was not even chopped up We decided they needed to be sent back and the waitress then proceeded to be rude from that point forward because of this  She replied with a smirk ""You will still have to pay for them"" That is not good business sense making your customers pay for food they have not even taken a bite of and are unsatisfied with The waitress darts off and lets the cook know what just happened He came out acting rude as well and making comments like ""What do you want me to do cut them up for you"" During this whole time a manager or owner looked on but did not approach the table to figure out what was going on Another bad business move to not want to try and resolve unhappy customers We will certainly not visit this establishment again and advise all our friends family and clients not visit either."
3258,0,"This place is a pit in the sketchy part of town  The first ""suite"" we checked into had hair on the bed and all over the bathroom floor  They moved us into another room that had a filthy toilet  To fix this the poor lady at the front desk had to come clean it herself  Yesshe was the only person working  The place is outdated run down and obviously the maids are not doing their job  Marriott needs to check in on this place."

2815,1,I am a big BBQ fan I really love that down south BBQ and prior to finding Fritzi's earlier this year I was going to Honey Bears any chance I'd get Now that I've found Fritzi's honey bears doesn't even belong in the same sentence I travel a lot and I always try to find that good bbq place while on the road and I've found some good ones But I am confident in saying that Fritzi's is by far one of the best I've found and its right here in my home state  Anyway Fritzi's is located in the same complex as Del Taco and Home Depot off Dysart and i00 The food here is absolutely spectacular If you like Ribs Chicken Wings or even Pull Pork sandwhiches whatever you like its ALL excellent They slow cook the ribs of course the meat just falls off the bones and it is some of the meatiest ribs I have ever eaten in my life But like all good bbq places its the sauce that makes all the difference and Fritzi makes some of the best sauce you have ever tasted  This is a mom and pop owned goldmine dont miss out  I try to go atleast once a week in fact there is a picture of me on the wall for being such a good customer  If you go there for lunch 4 bone ribs is all you need I believe it comes with 1 side but it might be 2 For sides I usually get Mac and Cheese & Sweet Potato Casserole both are amazing  A friend of mine really loves the Mixed Greens  If you going for Dinner 6 bones will do I usually get a full rack (12 bones) and eat it over a few days  They taste great re-heated as well  I guess thats about it its St Louis Style BBQ Amazing stuff try for yourself PS They have really good deserts beef brisket and cat fish as well .
3319,0,Absolutely disgusting  Horrible fries rancid tasting oily beef  Careless staff Way overpriced Steer clear.
2510,1,This place was awesome I liked choosing any plate of sushi on a whim When something delicious scrolled on by- I just grabbed it What a great idea It makes for a speedy lunch I went here with my boss because his kids love the place Well it just so happens that I love sushi too It was cool to check out a different sushi place than the usual RA or Stingray.
2961,1,Came here w/ the hubster's I've actually been craving this for some time now The pollo fundido is great So goooooood Its a pretty big portion The rest of the food looks really fresh too The best part is that they have churros Great prices and food.
607,1,The subs are fantastic and fresh Great shop and great customer service My husband and I go all the time We are life long customersMy favorite is the Torpedo and my husbands favorite is the Smokey Southwest MmmmmdeliciousI would strongly recommend trying Planet Sub for yourself.
3516,0,No thank you I ordered the red stew to go which comes with fried bread Took 10 minutes to deliver a pint of what can only be described as awful beef/veg soup Similar to Cambell's but had obviously been sitting over heat for the day as all the veggies were gooey soft and the meat dry ICK The fried bread was equally disappointing - flat (not fluffy) and had a horrible bitter taste which could only have come from old oil  Dirty no working AC.
1581,1,I love this place so much  What the hell is going on  Sign did change for a hot minute this year  But now the sign is back to Asi Es La Vida and the doors are chained and the phone number doesn't workWTF  my favorite restaurant  Please someone tell me they're remodeling and not closed  WHAT'S THE SCOOP.

2628,1,Just had an incredible weekend at the Bespoke Inn If you like any of these this place is for you: 1 location within a block of all of downtown Scottsdale's great restaurants with free parking at the inn 2 design Kate and Rob's sense of style is a mixture of complete awesomeness 3 new and clean they've only been open 6 months the place is spotless 4 food Kate and Rob are foodies we brought six for dinner on Saturday night 4 courses great food great setting in the courtyard and great conversation with the other guests 5 bicycling whether you are a hardcore mtn biker or road biker or a more casual bike pather Rob has a bike shop on premise and will hook you up He was a racer so is passionate about the sport and can point you in the right direction to the areas best riding 6 tranquility the courtyard is an amazing oasisRob and Kate and incredible hosts They are down to earth with a touch of class You will feel like a friend after hanging out with them a bit The place is beautiful We can't wait to go back with a handful of our closest friends to rent out the whole place We will be back.
4158,0,"***** Important Note *****After posting this review I receive perhaps the nicest note from an owner one could possibly receive (even offering his phone number) CLEARLY the owner takes GREAT care and concern  I am completely beside myself and I WILL be going back  What a bummer  Honestly this was BY FAR the worst breakfast experience I've EVER had1)  they had the front door propped open letting the diesel fuel and burning rubber smells waff about the place (from the light rail construction immediately outside the door)2   the IKEA coffee table (I know 'cause I bought mine there) I was eating off of was wobbly spilling my coffee all over the place3)  my coffee sucked4)  and my food really sucked -- I had the ""Switch [eggs] Benedict"" the hollandaise sauce sucked and the egg was over cooked and coldThat said the place is absolutely BEAUTIFUL they played trendy electronica in the background supplied free Wi-Fi and served liquor****************Okay second experience  I go back a second time to play on my MacBook and have a few drinks on the patio on a wonderfully great day  All is good until out of nowhere the waiter drops by my bill   Am I being shuttered out  Is his shift over  If so no biggie I've worked in a bar and am more than willing to tip out but I'd still like to stay and please tell me if that's that case  Grrrrr  Well at least the brunette waitress (not mine) is cute LOL*************."
554,1,Coming from New York i needed a place like this Ny has like 5-6 tier 0 Nike accounts and from what i hear this is the ONLY one in AZ  If you like quickstrikes and limiteds this is the place staff is not overly friendly but the kid that looks like Pharell is nice but coming from NY most tier 0 store employees are jerks so it's expected Highly recommend this place the mark up isn't bad at all with a wide range of brands though I myself am a Nikehead.
4917,0,"I'm just writing this review on the MMA & Boxing fights they have every so often I believe a referees that was there when he told me it's all about the money here that they don't give a damn about the kids fighting the fighters were 18 and up so they were adults but the ref that gave me this info had been in this business for a while and didn't like what he was seeing And he was right guys that were there to fight MMA had to box only or go home Then they were put against guys 30 to 40 pounds over there weight maybe 2 out of 10 matches were matched up correctly And the announcer didn't have info on the fighters he would look at the guy and say "" he's about 5'9 or so""  Plus I had called a day ahead to find out how much to get in he said $25 and all ages and when we get there it's $30 for standing and $35 for seating plus they separated the under 21 people so half my party was split up This place was a joke There speaker systems and fans kept shutting down every 15 minutes Beers were $4 and $6 for mixed drinks  I wouldn't recommend anybody to go see a fight here."
3141,0,Convenient when shopping in Desert Ridge Marketplace however the pizza was just AWFUL There was too much of the cornmeal on the bottom of the pizza (who uses cornmeal on the pizza anyway) and the slice was cold when they took it out of the ovenI would not go back for this pizza.
2218,1,Love the decor Love the food Love the ownersYes it is on the pricey side but a) you are in scottsdale and b) you get what you pay for - the food is high quality The freshest mozzarella is used in their salads pizza etc and the desserts are outstanding (the tirimisu and macaroons specifically)Love it I'll be back often.
1148,1,My sister and I went to this Home Depot to buy blinds for my new house  The salespeople were all awesome - not too clingy but always around when you needed them to be  They were able to cut my blinds same-day even though there were a LOT of cuts to be made  Now I happily have 8 new blinds to install.
4339,0,Took a couple of jeans to get hemmed here   The work was shoddy because they used standard thread not heavy duty thread  Also they didn't account for the spandex in the jeans so the stitching came out all baggy and loose  Nice couple but unfortunately I don't think they do good work for the price.
2773,0,Customer Service over the phone was very excellent BUUUUTTTTTTTTT i waited an hour and still didnt get my food I ordered at 7:15 and they didnt arrive till 9:02 I was very upset i turned them away I wasn't hungry anymore.
2990,1,"My first ""6 star"" review goes to Flowerama Let's start by saying I was hesitant to choose Flowerama for our wedding flowers based on their signage Yeah I know But lure me in However let me tell you fellow readers ignore the building and GO IN It's well beyond worth it I met with (unfortunately  ""former"" manager Shannon) who had worked there forever and really knew her stuff She was so amazingly knowledgeable I'm no flower expert but I know quality I set up an appointment for the next week for my husband and I to sit down with her to place our order (Lucky girl huh Most future spouses steer clear of assisting with flower duty) We arrive and she is ready to roll Has the books set at a cozy side table Now I have odd requests I'm not what one would call a ""traditional"" person We wanted to place an order for table flowers (3 tall per vase per table) for 30 or so tables and bouquets of wildflowers as a gift for all female patrons at our reception with our vows (from a song) tied around them She knew everything in season- what would work what wouldn't and how we could arrange them *HERE comes my 6th star: I wanted 7 flowers per bouquet Well my flower knowledge was lacking more than I thought because this would have cost more than my dress So what does Shannon and the Flowerama staff do Talk me down to 3 gorgeous flowers that tied up in absolute beauty with the EXACT look I wanted That's customer service folks I would have paid the initial amount without hesitation as I wanted them to be full and pretty Flowerama saw my vision and made it happen saving us almost 1700 dollarswithout me even asking how to decrease the overall cost  That's a ""personal"" level of service I have never seen Thank you SO MUCH for going the extra mile Every single flower was in mint condition and gave me tears A wedding day is a big deal and I had ZERO stress over the breathtaking flowers they provided Talk about a company who really does care I just called to verify information and spoke to the owner David Jones to verify name information for this review What a stand up guy who does truly have down home values and a passion for customer service They have proven it isn't all about the money Thanks for being honest and not trying to ""make a giant profit"" off someone trying to make a day so special For listening to what we said and making it happen (I will post pics when able from a different computer) ""Little girl I have found love the kind that old folks all speak of And no poet can dress it up with fancy words It is patient it is kind it forgives and it is blind And it cannot break no matter what you've heard"" -Levi Lowrey (Tied with raffia around our perfect bouquets)."
2965,1,Took myself to Rocket Fizz today to check out their selection and wow it was amazing A  ton of unique sodas British imported chocolates (including my favourite chocolate in the world Nestle Yorkie bar from Ireland) a wall of taffy (definitely try the gingerbread flavour if you're into that) mixed with assorted small candies ($399 for a medium bag - see photo - as full as you can fill it with whatever out of the bins = awesome deal) and assorted novelties All the sodas are $189 no matter what size which is a little more than I'm used to paying but if you get the 4 pack (also have 6 and 8 packs) it's like buying 3 and getting 1 free which is a pretty nice deal The guy who was working alone was super nice and funny and let me take home some of the discarded bottle caps for free (I collect them) Most of the sodas are out of the cooler but they have a few coolers filled as well so you can drink them right away There's also a lot of sugar free and organic candies for those that need them 5 stars for selection and service I'll definitely be back the next time I need a sugar fix.
2614,1,This loc is so quick and efficient with pickup Love the convenience of online-ordering Veggie fajita bowl rocksand just found out they'll use unsalted rice on request.
2934,1,Happy hour until 8pm and huge selection of wine and craft beers  Limited seating so get here early.
4537,0,If I could give this place less than one star I would My family and I had the WORST experience ever in this restaurant My friends and I frequent the Kona at Scottsdale Fashion Square and we love them So when we were looking for dinner by our house my dad suggested we go to this Kona I jumped at the opportunity BIG MISTAKE We walked into the restaurant and after a few minutes were greeted by a hostess She said it would only be about 10 minutes which was fine with us so we waited About 10 minutes later I looked around and there were several open tables I figured the servers just needed a moment to catch up so we continued to wait However 20 minutes after we were still waiting The hostess said she would bus the table and we would be seated shortly She started busing the table then left to talk to a gentleman who I am assuming was the manager After talking to him she finished busing the table Looking around the front room I could see at least 5 open tables However we were still not taken to the table she had just finished cleaning off After waiting for over 30 minutes she finally took us to our table where the hostess took our drink order saying our server would be right with us The server stopped by about 5 minutes later to say she would be right with us Where we waited for 10 additional minutes for someone to take our order Needless to say after spending almost an hour being ignored and not given service we decided they did not want not did they deserve our business We left $5 on the table to cover the soft drinks ordered and left The absolute lack of organization and customer service at this location is appalling and management needs to seriously reevaluate their practices We will never be back.
4790,0,I reviewed my bank statement online today and found out they had charged me twice for bad food I strongly recommend that you skip this restaurant all together Management is unresponsive to customer concerns.
4229,0,I visit the Gilbert and Warner location frequently I've had fairly consistently good service and food at that location This location is another storyAfter taking our drink order (waters and soda) it took over 10 minutes for the server to actually bring it blaming the bar for the delay even though she filled the cups at the soda station next to our table After our food was ordered half the food was brought to our table right away leaving half our party without their meals for another 10 minutes We had two orders of wings One order was covered in sauce the other had a dab on each piece It was $60 for an extra side of sauce After clearing our food we waited 15 minutes for the server to bring our bill then another 10 for our server to actually run payment Needless to say she got a $200 tip on a $4000 billIf you are in Gilbert just go to the one on Gilbert and Warner The service is better the food is better it was worth the drive.
56,1,I eat at Hana's probably two or three times a week  I absolutely love their chicken meal  Its grilled chicken rice pita and a small salad for about 9 dollars  I also love their grilled chicken sandwhich  It's more of a philly sandwhich type thing but sooo good You will not be dissapointedPS I just scarfed the Hana's Mixed Greens salad  Even though there wasn't really a mixture of greens really  it was soooo good Almonds parmasean marinated kabob chicken onion tomato cucumber and lots of cabbage Yum.
2747,1,Simply the best breakfast Delicious creamy pancakes and the best eggs benedict I've ever had California bacon benedict with a side of fresh fruit and hashbrowns and a fresh bottomless cup of coffee yum No matter how busy this place gets we always get great friendly and fast service Have to still try their delicious looking personal pies and bread pudding.
3116,0,Sadly with new owners comes changes on menu  My fav Barbecue chicken saladno longer has a hint of the same taste It should now be called flavor of tomato  Also sad to find out that the most outstanding veggie sandwich now tastes like it comes from another country Again not a single hint of similarity of same flavor Im sure many people will love these new changes  Yet Im sad it's not the same I woke up today dreaming about the old veggie sandwich No joking.
214,1,I have been a customer of Molly Maids for years  Why1 - crew is always on time2 - flexibility - if I need to change my day/slot I can do so without fail3 - nothing has ever been stolen (lol)4 - the house SPARKLES5 - reliability and consistencyI have used 4 other cleaning services since moving here 9 years ago  Invariably all the others eventually slacked off in quality which is why they got the bootNot with Molly Maids however  Also the franchise owner Kurt is very approachable and a real gem  I had to suspend service for a few months and he was kind enough to keep my prime slot for me  And kept my rate the same when I returned  Not many business owners would be that accommodating.
347,0,You're kidding me right 5 stars On a 50 point scale maybe When I held up the pizza to the light I could blasted see through it If I want to pay $16 for pretty air I'll come back The only positives were spending time with my colleague and Dave our server - the nicest fastest most courteous guy in the joint And is the only reason it got a single starDon't know why this place is so overrated Save yourself some time money and culture - order togo from Buca.
791,1,Our stay here was great all around even though the hotel is currently doing some construction work  The service was polite and excellent all around  Our room was clean comfortable and very nicely appointed  Great large bathrooms and just nice all aroundWe spent time at the pool for a Yelp event and really liked it  There are good views all around and the bar is easy to get to and well stockedAside from the restaurants right in the hotel there are a whole lot of very good options within a couple minutes of walking.
462,1,I've eaten here several times now and it's been very good every time  The selections are good as are the sauces  They cooked it very well everyone was very friendly and attentive and we were in & out in under 45 minutes The prices are higher than they were but I think for what you get it's reasonably priced - and draft beers were $2/$3 - can't beat that  This is the only one that I've been to but we will definitely go back.
2895,0,If I could give this place a ZERO STAR I would  From the moment we walked into the casino a wannabe-police security rudely told us that we could not roll our luggage on the casino floor but had to follow the non-carpet path towards the hotel  What casino has a no-luggage policy on the casino floor  One of our friends forget his wallet in his room after check-out  His wallet was found in lost-and-found but his $200 cash was gone  Front desk people had no customer service what-so-ever  All the workers need to sign up for customer-service 101 in Las Vegas NV where hotel guest services are impeccable  Even though the hotel was modern customer-service is what makes guests' experiences positive and guests wanting to come back.
1184,1,I love Cartel The coffee is awesome and the employees are almost always friendly Do they have their bad days Sure but so does everyoneI've noticed that most of the people complaining or leaving negative (or less positive) reviews are doing so because of the clientele How immature Let's stick to reviewing the venue and the product not whether you like the patrons If some patron doesn't like a frappuccino and says so to the barista who really gives two flying pigs Everyone is entitled to their opinion My recommendation is to try to be a little less insecure and consider the impact your review will have on the actual business and the people that put their blood sweat and tears into it before you start taking away points because a certain part of society seeks out novelty and enjoys well made things Just my two cents.
4396,0,"Looked good from far but far from good  Dined there jan3 for dinner&  it was our first time  We walked in and stood at the hostess station for about 4 minutes with no acknowledgment  Finally I asked the girl if we needed to put our names in for seating  After not getting seated for about 10 minutes (out of order) we started browsing the buffet  There is quite a variety of different dishes that you wouldn't see at a normal chinese buffet  By the time you had to narrow your choices from either dry or burnt rubbery entrees we settled on the safer choices  The waiter didn't show up to take our drink order for about 5 minutes  We didn't actually get our hot tea until we were finished with our first plates  The tea wasn't even jasmine tea  It was a lipton tea bag    He never checked on us or even picked up one single plate throughout our entire meal  I asked him how long they had been open he said since october  Now tell me how a restaurant that is only 3 months old can have the worst hostesses wait staff & cooks imaginable  I had mentioned to the waitor how unacceptable everything was  he apologized and then took another 30 minutes to give us the bill  The price for an adult was 1599 and my 4 yr Old was charged $388 Plus the two bucks for the bitter lipton tea  There was no attempt to get a manager to rectify the situation  Clearly nobody cares what you think  I was so infuriated that a lack of management presence allows these"" teenagers"" and their lackidaisical attitudes run this place  So i'm yelping   Mediocre food high prices and crappy service  Will never go back again unless they pull their act together and start getting better reviews."
50,1,I have seen all three doctors (Dr Pham only once in the hospital when my third was born)  Because he was the attending pediatrician I fell into this office and have felt grateful ever since  The doctors are friendly (especially the PA Johanna)  The staff is courteous helpful and really know their stuff  I particularly appreciate their knowledge on billing situations  I have only had to wait once or twice mostly I am seen quickly  I've moved a lot and therefore have had my kids go to a lot of different pediatricians and this is by far my favorite office.
4990,0,Ordered pork tacos cost around $12 Cold tasted like Taco Bell not good quality food I think they pre-make the food the tacos were wrapped in foil I didn't eat it.
715,1,"The $2 kids cone is a steal for fresh made Gelato Some cheaper ice creams have that ""light"" feel to them These delicious concoctions are fresh made daily and are filling The prices are higher  but you're getting quality A great afternoon treat I will be coming back soon."
4646,0,WoW  one star Those are very rare for me but here's why The place its still looks really good and feel about it The waiters are ill-trained I came here with a groupon/google offer I've always wanted to see what it is all about I am so thankful that I was only out a few bucks and didn't have to pay full price They screwed up my bill and took FOREVER to fix Had to get the manager who was very nice but about as incompetent as the serving staff The food is very bland the customer service is NOT horrible but as bland as the food Good news I got my bill fixed after having to get in the manager involved and after a really long wait With so many places in the vicinity don't waste your time or your money.
4061,0,Firstly I would like to say that I love the food here each time I have visited the food has been delish However the food cannot make up for the horrid service and horrible managing We spent well over 2 hours waiting on one pizza and one salad The manager was not where in sight and the server was either very new or just not well trained I do not recommend this place based solely on service.
2976,0,I have never been so disappointed in an oil change First they took my car and told me they would contact me when it was ready so I was free to do some shopping in Costco next door  They never called  I walked back over to pick up my car to find they never touched it and refused to work on it  They said they heard a noise in the engine and would not tell me what it was  (I had it checked out at different place)  Sears told me my engine could blow up at any moment  All that was wrong was the O2 sensor was broken (nothing to cause and engine to blow up)  These guys were just lazy and did not want to do any work  They chose to scare me instead  I will never go back to a Sears Auto Center for anything.
239,1,All baristas are not created equal The crew at Seattle Espresso knows how to pull shots They've got the best iced mocha in town They splash Illy with heavy cream Definitely worth driving to S Tempe for.
2645,1,"This place is legit  It's nice to have a change from other typical lame coffee shops that you see in airports  I got the ""Iced Dirty Chai Latte"" and it didn't disappoint  If I find myself in this airport in the middle of the desert again I'll be coming back  Good job guysPS  Kinda reminds me of the Better Buzz Lab in San Diego CA (Pacific Beach)."
1275,1,Very nice staff and this place is very clean The veterinarians are honest and reliable.
1381,0,"We had friends in town from out of state and wanted to take them to Corleone's since it was one of our favorite casual restaurants We were there on July 12 2010 around 1:30pm or 2:00pm When we walked in the door we were given the spiel about how much better Corleone's is than other cheesesteak places He (the manager) even went as far as to put down the other Corleone's restaurant on 16th street and Camelback in Phoenix that we frequent quite often like at least weekly sometimes a couple times a weekKeith (or so he said that was his name) the manager proceeded to  make cocaine and drug references about the food Saying that his creation flies out the door like cocaine good drugs and gold bars After we stated that we didn't appreciate the drug and cocaine references because we had a 14 year old girl with us he proceeded to make an inappropriate remark about her looking more ""mature"" than a 14 year old girl One of us left with the 14 year old and her mother When asked who the manager was he told us that he was and tried to shake hands After refusing to shake his hand and starting to walk out the door he said and don't ever grace my door againno problem we would NEVER go back It's sad that a person like this can ruin a very good restaurant for more than one location but I am seriously considering never going to another Corleone's since someone like that can be a manager."
3221,0,"how this company has such great reviews is beyond me i called and got two specific quotes for service and made an appointment for a specific time for the work to be done so that it could be done as quickly as possible 5 hours after i dropped my vehicle off for my ""scheduled"" appointment it still hadn't been looked at but the real issue is that the services that i got very clear quotes on were now more expensive one by only $15 but the other by more than $100 i'm losing faith in yelp."
2037,1,Great great sandwiches.
3290,0,Everything was fine until we saw a cockroach roaming around the shelves behind the counter where we were sitting   When we finished we were sitting there for awhile before one of the staff finally brought us our check  I wanted to get change for a tip but there was nobody at the cashier and none of the workers bothered to acknowledge us  During this time (and it was NOT busy) several workers were just standing around talking  When one of them walked by with his face buried in his phone I'd had enough  Left a 50 cent tip that was frankly too much for the lousy service but we'd have been there another 20 minutes just to get our change  The cool old-fashioned ice cream parlor we were hoping for was in actuality a dirty dump with bush league service  Derp.
1993,1,Let me preface this by sharing that I don't even live in Chandler and I'm sure I will be back at Brunchie's Yep it's true My fiance and I deemed this spot as worthy of the 45 minute drive it takes to get there from where we live in North Phoenix But I'm ahead of myselflet me begin by sharing that I was not a happy camper this morning as we left for our Sunday Brunch tradition Late start unexpected stops blah blah blahit seemed like everything was preventing me from getting food in my tummy Despite my grumpiness we made it to Brunchie's and sauntered inside I was pleasantly suprised by the short wait which my grumpy self was extremely grateful for (but note that it was about 12:30 when we arrived) The joy of perusing such an appealing menu while we waited also helped tremendously The bad mood was subsiding Then our food came and seriously I couldn't remember being grumpy in the first placeThe fiance tried the special of the day the Wild West Burrito and he was more than impressed The size of the burrito itself was hefty and every bite had a generous portion of fillings This place was not sheisty with their carne asada Bonus points in my man's bookI ordered the most hearty meal that my empty stomach was craving - chicken fried steak Ummtalk about homestyle comfy cooking The gravy was legit - creamy flavorful and with bits of sausage The biscuit was large and in charge and just as legit as the gravy on it Even my potatoes were delicious - definitely not the Ore-Ida frozen in a bag kind The chicken fried steak had quality all over it down to the perfect breading and thickness of the cutlet Imagine the Denny's version on super steroids - better quality and flavor for sureThe fiance and I even shared a short stack of pancakes (so we like having both the savory and sweet parts of brekky can you blame us) which were fluffy and hit the sweet spot craving Obviously we couldn't finish all the food in front of us and honestly that was the only thing we were upset about - NOT being able to eat every last bite because we were so happily full alreadyLong story shortwe were happy with our Brunchie's experience From the short wait the service and our food we left the place extremely happy campers We felt like we had just had a great huge homestyle meal just like the ones my dad makes when we're visiting How much more comfy and happy can you get Like I said we plan on making the trek back here again in the future because it's THAT good.
763,1,This is a no-brainer Go It has weird hours Go The menu is complicated Go Good Tex-Mex and Northern Mexican I was born here and have spent a lot of time in Mexico I don't mess around with OK Mexican placesNo frills No convenience No BS Great food.
323,1,Great service and food.
3277,0,Let's just say that it's a pretty cool place that based on service won't be open long We stopped in for MNF and had to beg to be served Then they took the meal order for my girl friend but didn't take mine One meal came out and they finally put 2 and 2 together and figured out what happenedNext we had to actually reach over the front of the bar to get silverware Most restaurants automatically give those to youNext the ice in the drinks is so small you have to use a straw whether you want to or not Can't rate their food becasue they never asked if I wanted to order but the service was awful and I won't be back.
4269,0,This is my second order and by accident I ordered from them months ago and swore never again But it just so happened that I get so many flyers on my door that this one slipped through First things first I ordered pork and veg And chicken and veg for myself as I only eat chicken fish and turkey Reason I say that is because I received chicken and veg with shrimp and veg Guess who's deathly allergic to shrimpThe food was bland dry and Luke warm The fried rice is the worst I ever tasted Salty and dry And not even that nice Brown nutty color of fried rice I almost thought it was spoiled food The lady on the phone said she heard me say I wanted shrimp that's a lie I'm not suicidal and don't have an eppi pen Why would I order shrimp ladyAlso she was giggling when I asked her if she got a lot of complaints I didn't check yelp before I placed my order if I had this would all have been avoidedShe offered to refund my money forty min ago If she does I will post it later if she doesn't I will go postal I only wish I paid with a credit card so I could dispute this and not worry about a refund ItIf you're thinking about placing  an order don't waste your money It would be better spent on burritos out of the freezer at the local Circle KNever again Chopsticks  ExpressOk they delivered my refund But not before I received my two subs from Jimmy Johns Expresslol what a joke.
4538,0,We had mother's day brunch and overall this place was a fail  The buffet was $1695/person + tax + 18% gratuity  Over priced  My water glass was refilled only once our dirty plates weren't taken until we asked our silver wasn't replaced and the buffet selection was unimpressive No omelet bar or anything beyond basic buffet.
1196,1,Cherubini's is closing in a week  Is there no GodOne of the four horseman of good coffee shops is shutting down  Cherubini's you can operate out of my apartment for free  Just let me run it past my landlord.
4588,0,We went there on a Monday afternoon  It was slightly crowded  We sat in the bar area  It took a while to be noticed  We placed our order which came in good time  The meal was terrible  I ordered pollo fundido and did not like it at all  The only thing I could taste was sour cream  I would not go back I would sooner drive to Phoenix and get better food.
4138,0,Loud  Musters are horrid Danny hall the manager a dick Don't go Over rated Loud inside Wet outside.
3743,0,I have been coming to this subway during my lunch hour for over a year The service use to be great but there was a staff change that occurred over 6 mths ago They have never been very friendly but today especially everyone had a bad attitude Staff is very rude Some of the workers were even  slamming doors and being rude to one another as well as to the customers I don't recommend eating here.
2152,1,The service at this store was amazing and the saved my wedding dress shopping experience  The first store I visited was I do I do and it was horrible  The service at An Affair to Remember is awesome  They are very knowledgeable about their dresses and are a full service store that stands behind their product  As the previous review states they only carry two lines but they are decent lines with good quality dresses for reasonable prices  If you like Maggie Sottero or Casa Blanca then this is a wonderful store to visit.
92,1,I have been a patron of the original Lolo's for years and have to admit I like the colorful flavor and mix of people at that location But I live in Tempe and own a business right down the street from the Scottsdale location I went right after it first opened and even though it was so shiny and clean and didn't have the urban feel I love so much I can't deny that the food isn't just as delicious Everything I have ever had on the menu is heart stopping good literally I only partake of Lolo's delight a few times a year but it is always craved.
3127,0,This place is a staple lunch spot for us I have rated this place highly before Today an order mix up became a very uncomfortable situation Really too bad.
955,1,When a friend and I were talking one thing we both agreed on @ LGO WINGS Bleu cheese and ranch are both AMAZING Pizza is incredible as well Made a great date night the other day Keep your shorts on for parking tho.
4120,0,This is first time I try to use their  service  Base on the review I think they should be good  We call for service for my water heater  They are way overcharged  I frankly told them that I have to compare the service  They charged me 6000 knowing they will not get the job  Pretty sneaky company   60 dollars just to tell me how much it cost me to get the installation done  Pretty easy money huh  I bet they don't make business by doing good job but piling up the profit by going out to make 6000 for half hour  Take my advise  avoid them  I found a good plumber after all and I believe you will.
845,1,So many great accessories and cute clothes I got my accessories for my Wedding here and they were perfect Everything from clutches to earrings from cute tops to watches they have everything color coordinated.
4748,0,I would give it zero I don't understand how this can be a brand they dont DO anything their clothes have NO design touch to them at all You can't even count the colors since they do every color so they dont really have to think about that either I'm sorry but 50 bucks for a boring cheap hoodie just isn't worth my time.
1435,0,Had a positive experience here before but after calling and being told she could squeeze me in I came into the shop and was told sorry she was unable to help me  I normally don't give negative reviews it's just the way she treated me when I stopped in I asked if she knew anybody else around to help me and she shook her head and said sorry there's nothing I can do for you Which would not have been a problem if she had just been honest with me on the phone and had a little bit of customer service and some courtesy when I was in her shop She was short and abrupt and I won't be doing business here again.
1839,1,Love home smoked quality BBQ Tired of chain joints that cost too much for gimmicky food Andrew's will blow you away in a smokey cloudNothing fancy: the way barbeque was meant to be served You go up and order at a counter in front of an massive open kitchen where you can see their smokehouse and talk to the pit masters as they work You sit down at simple wooden tables with a roll of paper towels in the center and your choice of home-made BBQ sauces You get served in baskets or trays covered in checked picnic paper You eat with businessmen and doctors shoulder to shoulder with landscapers and the smelly and bearded Everyone (besides those damn vegatarians) love Andrew's And why not Grade-A Kansas City Q being served up without any frills and bullsh*t Just what the valley neededThe fact that you're still reading this review means you've waited too long to go You owe it to yourself to put the best BBQ in AZ in your mouth Get in your car and go You'll thank me later.
4799,0,Look out  The nice girls on the phone are a cover for the worst billing nightmares which will plague you  They randomly charge you and say 'oh well' it was a mistake  In the meantime bounced check charges are not covered Also they left a not-cool box on the drive after I moved and the next people could not move into the house as the driveway was blocked  I lost my deposit for not returning the property in a timely fashion  They never returned my call re:  why they 'forgot' to pick up the pod  Stay away  No one can be this bad  You will lose money with them  One star is too much.
2686,1,Best burger I've ever had  How can you go wrong Beef burger with pork belly cooked to perfection with gruyere cheese caramelized onion and baconaise all nestled between a butter bun  Soooo good  My friend had the Drunk chicken crust sandwhich that was equally as delicious  Can't wait to go back for dinner with my hubby.
4415,0,When you have the corner restaurant on Mill and University you better bring it  With that being said I think this place has a long way to go and I think it's going to close down before that time comesIt's a great concept  I can imagine it being a decent place for a night life  I wasn't there for that  I was there at noon on a Monday  Bad ideaMy wife mom and I ordered the cheese burger  How can you go wrong  My wife went to order it medium rare and got a disclaimer from the nice but incredibly forgetful waitress (I'll get to that later) that medium rare is very rare here  She talked her into ordering it medium  I still stuck with medium rare  My burger came out like a hockey puck while my mom and wife's came out medium well  I sent mine back  My dad ordered biscuits and gravy they looked good but my dad felt like the gravy came out of a canThe waitress was a nice girl  I can imagine working there she might get a lot of stuck up and rude clientele  What I don't understand is she would suggest something we'd get it and then she'd forget it  Eg: side salad for my wife order of fries for my dad swiss on my moms burger  All were forgotten and brought out when reminded  There were maybe 2 other tables there and 2 waitresses on duty  She wrote everything down  I guess she had a long weekend  Good thing her personality kept her from getting a full tipBottom line this food is terrible  The service is terrible  This place has nothing going on for itself  From reading Daniel R's review I can see that this place may redeem itself in a nightlife situation but I'll never find out for myself.
1193,0,Waited 2 1/2 hours just for the doctor to fill out a prescription refill Thank god I'm generally a calm person Just know you'll be waiting at least 1hr till they call your name They'll schedule you at 2 or whatever but the doctor won't be available till 3.
1974,0,I'm not the type to bash someones way of making a living My wife and I went in there Sat nite We both ordered a BRC buritto and I also got 3 taquitos and she also got 2 drumsticks Her drumsticks were burned and asked to get others My taquitos were undercooked but edible Sun morning I woke up to really bad stomach isssues and my wife threw up I'm still not feeling well after 2 days and neither is she I'm really pissed off and feel bad for anyone else that received the same unwanted gift.
4465,0,Well pretty disappointed that they would not honor a gift certificate I have (it was quite expired I understand that but circumstances out of my control prevented me from using it previously)  My friend purchased an hour and a half massage for me so you know that wasn't cheap  Called today and they are unwilling to honor it since it's expired  I might even understand if it was under new management/ownership so they could explain that the money paid previously was not in their pocket but that isn't the case  They got the money and they lost out on a potential new client  I'm pregnant and have been looking for a place to get regular pre-natal massages but this will definitely not be my place  I work in marketing for a similar client-focused industry and we would NEVER turn down a potential new client even if their gift card/coupon was expired  Just bad business but they got the money and clearly don't care.
212,1,Had the most memorable experience here Everyone was so nice and talkative My tech Sarah was very outgoing and did a fantastic job on my mani/pedi I will definitely come back again when I am in the area.
4996,0,"Despite the fact that this bar is getting one star you should go there and soon Mostly because it won't be open long Friend won a ""VIP"" party Yay let's goTurns out that means four dollar domestic drafts and two dollars off well drinks Wow Lookout we got a crazy night coming They seat us in the corner and the six of us order a drink We practiced conversing for about 25 minutes before 4 beers and two drinks arrived 66% accuracy rate Nothing really improved after this Lame waitress was incredibly slow to bring drinks and take orders It was lame Especially when it was not too busy in the bar A bouncer type guy brought us two of our drinks after we asked him to get us our waitress After we decided to move on it took them over 15 minutes to bring our cards back WTF If you like being ignored and crunching ice with your teeth instead of drinking the beer you ordered this is your new spot Hurry while the horrible service has that new bar smell."
3584,0,Meh I am not a fan I went here for happy hour one time and I was beyond disappointed They must've had their D list chefs working Cuz my food was GROSS I couldn't even finish it Kinda sucks spending that much money on nasty sushi.
1045,1,We went here for dinnerhad dined here before however this time we were fortunate enough to have a Groupon I would dine there without it any day of the week We love the byobsince that allows us to have a reallllly good bottle of wine ($9 corking fee - nice) with an excellent meal Highly recommend itbest meal I've had outprobably since Binkley's and that's saying something.
40,1,Obsessed  Ambiance is great service also great  The menu freakin' rules my life  The beverages are always fun and delicious  I had something with lemon and kale and it was so good  Bison Burger is good Salmon is good Ahi appetizer is good although I am guessing every option would be delicious  Lot's of stuff for dietary weirdo's such as myself  My normal boyfriend also loves it  I haven't had dessert but it looks divine  I will re-visit often.
3249,0,"This location needs to be educated in regards to gluten intolerant people Like you need to change your gloves and wash your hands when someone says they are allergic to beardAlso the owner and his fiance need to communicate better They are on different shifts If I go in while he is there he is great and has amazing understanding of my issues and what I am asking for is my sandwich (the same portions of a 6"") to be placed in a bowl He puts it in a salad bowl Now granted it's not filling up a salad bowl and that is fine But when she is there she denies that I have this arrangement with the owner and will put it in a soup bowl Now you've got to know that the same equal portions of a 6"" would not fit in a soup bowl Especial my topping choices Get on the same page and educate your staff."

3973,0,So half way through a pretty good breakfast one of six of us found a hair on our food The waitress said she would remove it from the bill As the check arrived we noticed the manager took off 10% I asked to speak to him and basically got into an argument over him removing a nine dollar breakfast item We were all pretty mortified to be treated so poorly They definitely lost 6 customers Fail.
4693,0,"Huge waste of our time I made a reservation and requested a romantic table for two When we got there the hostess sat us next to a table of 4 who were extremely loud I get thatthey were all having fun We asked to move to a table outside but was told that they were all reserved  This wasn't a very big place but the outside area was very pretty and was lit by candlelight We sat for maybe 5 min and the hostess came back and gave us a wine list and thennothing We waited and waited hostess came back again and asked if we had questions about the wine list I said I did and she said she would try to answer but didn't know much about wine Hmmmm ok Still no server At that point we then decided to leave  Very disappointed for a couple of reasons1 I would not think it would be so difficult to be acknowledged by a server after all they are there to take care of our dining accomadations2 We were on vacation and this place was very out of the way  We waisted part of our evening and when vacationing that is the last thing I want to do3  Hostess never said""Is there a problem""  She saw us leave we walked right past her."
4473,0,This agent and team is the worst they don't do what you ask them to do The staff is less than helpful and they behave in a dishonest manner I asked the office to do a specific task and I had to call their corporate number all to get a policy cancelled They in turn have lost all my business to another carrier.

4909,0,We thought we'd give this new place a try since we had a BOGO coupon to use  My family loves fro yo but this was not the place for us  We sampled a couple of tastes and could not get ourselves to enjoy it enough to make a bowl  The fruit toppings looked disgusting- old and just sitting in juice  The 1 employee working did welcome us in but we had to walk out without a purchase because it was so awful  This place is not going to last especially being across from one of the best run cleanest fro yo spots in the neighborhood- Kokomo  We will not be returning.
34,1,This is my favorite buffet in all of Arizona  It's really clean bright inside rare for buffets  My favorite things are the little sushi bar crab legs and the teppan table I've never had a bad experience at this place really nice people work here  It's also good for a group of people.
3688,0,We like to compare the calamari appetizer at different restaurantsWe questioned the server regarding the menu description which says the calamari contains zucchini: she assured us it was only a small amount The calamari arrived  with half squid and half zucchini and was also rubberyWe got up and left and went to Alessia's at Brown and HigleyIf you are in the east valley give it a try.
543,1,"BLD = Bo Loves  ummm Bo Loves Dis-Place :)I really do love this place I first heard of it thru Yelp but never had the chance to visit since it's far from the land of Scottsdale where I dwell  Finally made it and boy was I thrilled  I sat at the bar where Aaron was a great host and kept my drinks full  I ordered ""The Goat Burger"" -- Yummy  Oh serve me a sweet bite: goat cheese bacon roma tomatoes and arugula  Oh how it pleased my palates The burger was sweet and the scent of the arugula traveled thru my nostrils with delight  This was one good burger and I must recommend itThe place is like a lounge and with an awesome wine rack in the back  I totally dig the designs and the communal table in the middle  I recommend sitting at the end of the bar where the table curves around where you can chat with your friends and of course Aaron which showed and offered up some of his favorite wines -- Thanks man - Enjoy."
2698,1,This is such a great addition to Sky Harbor  I normally park at one of the off-site locations but decided to check out the Sky Train on my last trip  I had to check a bag so I pulled up to the curbside bag check (which to use you must arrive at least 90 minutes before your flight) and checked my bag with ease  That is a fantastic feature  It currently only serves those flying Southwest or US Airways  I parked in one of the garages took the elevator down to the ground level and then took the escalator up to the train platform  The trains run every few minutes so my wait was less than 5 minutes  The short trip drops you off in the middle of Gate level at Terminal 4  Very convenient.

4085,0,"I approach most joints like Jolta Java as if it's going to be a four or five star experience otherwise why would I be going  So the moment I walked in to Jolta Java it had the feel of a 4 or 5 star place  My wife and I order our coffees mine was hot hers was iced  The girl making the drinks didn't really seem to know what she was doing  She had to ask another employee a couple of questions before making them  My wife's iced coffee didn't have enough sweetener in it so we had to ask for another squeeze  THEN as I'm waiting for my latte I look across the store and see two employees smooching and hugging behind the counter as if this coffee shop was their own private little romantic cabana  So now it's a three star joint  I can get over it but not too excited about itTHEN the dude Mr Schmoocher is totally obnoxious and loud with the other employees including Mrs Schmoocher calling each customer who comes in ""Boss""    If the owner reads these reviews (hopefully Mr Schmoocher isn't the owner) you need to do something about this guy if you want your shop to thrive  Huge problems  And that's how it moved from a 4 or 5 star joint to a 1 star joint."
300,1,Best burger I have ever eaten in my life Seriously.
3543,0,I wasn't sure whether I should write this review because I have a healthy fear of being whacked  Three co-workers and I sidled in one day and our first impression was that we were eating at a front for the mob  We felt less than welcome when we entered and none of the people by the cash register cared to acknowledge us  Begrudgingly we were given a table  The furniture was something out of an old folk's home  Everyone squeaked into their seats  We weren't sure whether we belonged and then we noticed that the only other patrons were old folks  My friend ordered pasta and paid extra for meatballs actually for one whole meatball  What I ordered was very forgettable  It took a while but we finally got our food which seemed odd as it was quite plain and entirely unremarkable  We split the bill with one person paying cash and the rest using credit cards  It took over ten minutes to get our cards back with receipts which was odd as we were the only people left in the place  The waitress admonished us for making her life difficult  I pointed out that my card had my picture on it and was told that was part of the problem  Immediately upon returning to the office we all checked our bank accounts  We were all charged for our meals except for one of my co-workers who was charged for all four meals even the one who paid cash.
1688,1,My friends at the Anytime Fitness told me to check it out So one day I ventured here after a workout and what can I sayI am hooked  Love the airy atmosphere  beautiful holiday decor so many areas to sit choices galore for drinks food looks delicious and the price is nice $4 & change gets you a 24 oz latte and its so good Live bands too amazing  A new addiction.
2061,1,Great bagels great chopped liver and very friendly staff  Great deli.
1958,1,- I was there March 16th      This coffee shop is AMAZING i love the vibe the artwork their freshness and of course their cookies     I have already been raving to my friends how good this place is and how we need to frequent coffee shops like this kind more often instead of our usual Starbucks     The service is outstanding as I walked to the counter I was greeted by the cashier and I bluntly told him that it was my first time there and that I was taking their Chai as well as a pastry but I didn't know which one He then started telling me that their pastries are freshly baked each morning at their downtown location and that he suggested the Chocolate Chip cookie as it was his own Fav So I told him You had me at freshly baked I'll take your chocolate chip coffee and a Medium non-fat Chai The only thing was that they didn't have medium sized drinks they only have small or large small is just too little for me and large is just too much medium is just perfect for me but no medium and I end up not drinking it all So I took the large and as expected I wasted about 1/6 of my deliciously large hot  foamy non-fat Chai :)    I will surely be back to frequent this spot everyone there was oh soo friendly :).
4732,0,"I bought a coupon for this place BEFORE I checked the ratings  Tried it on Friday because there is  ""Flamenco"" show  At about 7:35PM a guitarist takes his place on a chair and begins to strum  Hmmm  not bad I thought  Then a woman with dancing shoes emerges wearing a frilly nylon pink dress which could have easily been a nightgown  (not trying to be mean just telling the truth)  She did two dances and during the rest of her time she sat down and  clapped along while the guitarist played  When I presented the coupon the waiter told me that I had to order two entrees  Having read from other Yelpers that they had been told the same I quickly corrected the waiter and told him that the coupon said $40 worth of FOOD not necessarily entrees  They acquiesced They served us hot rolls no butter  Instead a garlicky ranch type dressing  I put up with it  cost saving measure I guess  My friend ordered the Chicken Al Jerez a chicken cutlet in sherry sauce  He didn't want rice so he got vegetables  On the menu in the restaurant it doesn't specify that dishes come with soup or salad as it does on the internet  I told the waiter and he added a salad The chicken was overdone but the taste of the sauce was good  Mushrooms on the chicken were out of a can  Salad was fresh  I had two appetizers  Empanadas & Shrimp wrapped in bacon  Empanadas should be meat filled turnovers  Not here  It was made with pizza dough stuffed with tomato sauce and slivers of chicken so small that I had to closely check it to be sure what it was  I set it aside because it was not worth eating  The waiter saw this and offered to get me another appetizer  Nice guy  Ordered Tortilla Espanola a traditional fritata containing sliced potatoes in its place  It was good  You can't hurt a frittata Just dump stuff in the eggs and you're done  I enjoyed the shrimp and bacon appetizer (I think Trader Joe's sells these frozen)  until I awoke last night with heartburn  I remember eating them and thinking that the bacon was not totally crisped up (needed more time in the oven)  My fault for not telling them  The saving grace of this evening was the server who waited on us and really tried to please us  The one star is for him  The owner who had greeted us initially at the door was busy setting tables with tablecloths (another cost-cutting measure) instead of checking in on his patrons  I for one do not recommend this place to anyone."
2060,1,Ate at TK's Urban Tavern several times and the food is great The pulled pork sandwich is a home run a must try Sampled the mac & cheese onion rings shrimp & pasta dish fresh roasted chicken homemade pretzel and the desserts- all were delicious The ambiance makes this a perfect place to meet and dine with family and friends Loved TK's Urban Tavern It's a wonderful dining experience Try it you'll love it.
4798,0,They STEAL  The worst hotel everIIt hurts me a lot to give them a starOne of my friend came from China to visit mea few weeks ago He checked  in on Mar 7 And we went to a NBA game Phoenix Suns VS Huston Rockets His biggest American dream come true He had a wonderful trip in the US until on Mar 11 He left his room around 8:30 am and I took him back to his hotel at 3:00pm he found out his $900000 camera was gone Also the charger was in the side pocket of his backpack which was at least a yard a way from the camera was goneThe people who took the camera apparently searched his room We call the general manager immediately he came listened then told us that he's be back with us very soon After 4 hours of waiting we went into his office he told us that the technician told us that only 2 people entered the room one my friend the other the housekeeper DUH He told us he needed 1205 hours for an answer but he didn't By the time we checked out on march 14th that was the last time we saw the general manager his name is Angel He told us that everything was out of his hand We had to complain to the Holiday Inn Corp Guest Relationship They told us someone would contact us no more than 2 days 2 weeks later I have to complain again because no one contacted me Now its been more than 3 weeks STILL no contact Now it's time for people to know what happened In HOLIDAY INN THEY STEAL PLEASE DO NOT stay here if you have a choice If you have no choice KEEP YOUR EYES OPEN.

3574,0,Went here with some buddies and we all had something different The food was really bad to begin with when my brother took a bite out of his burger it was raw ground beef yuck The chicken burgers were the same cold and under cooked I had the chicken salad and the chicken was under cooked as well But here is the worst we left comment cards which weren't bad Just stating the fact that the food was under cooked and tasteless As we walked by the waitress and the cook (some punk in a pony tail) were staring at us and the cook flips us off I was not about to have that some punk thinks he's all that in front of the girls So I walk back in and the goof runs off like a CHICKEN:) I spoke with the manager and he said he will take care of it But I doubt that because I noticed the comment cards in his hands as I was walked out and he was tearing them up Obviously  trying to cover up their backs So stay clear of this place.
325,1,Having just relocated from the Northwest where there are tons of great doggy daycares I started to panic a bit when locals in Phoenix told me that there aren't many daycares in the area  Luckily I found out about Fido's after a vet in the area told me about the place  I absolutely love this place as does my high maintenance yellow lab  The staff is extremely friendly and clearly love dogs which is one of the most important things I look for in a doggy daycare  And they give great baths  As far as boarding I will not leave my dog overnight at any daycare that does not have someone who is on site overnight in the event something happens  Fido's always has someone stay the night which gives me the peace of mind that I need when I'm traveling  They also are picky about dogs who can stay there which means that they screen out the aggressive dogs  The only negative about this place is that it doesn't have any outdoor play areas but given the heat around here that fact doesn't impact my review and certainly won't keep me from going back  I know that my dog is safe pampered and surrounded by friendly dogs and staff which keeps me coming back  Overall a fantastic place that I will visit whenever necessary even if it's a bit out of my way.
2789,1,I had travertine installed throughout my home the week after Christmas I was impressed from the moment I walked into the Custom Floor Covering showroom Andy took the time to educate me about stone flooring Doug came a few days later to give me an estimate and a few days after that the work began I was very fortunate to have Charlie do the installation because he is a master craftsman The end result is beautiful.
4823,0,"Absolutely terrible I would give this place 0 stars if I could I was with a group of 6 other people and none of us enjoyed our meal The chips and salsa (a staple at any Mexican food restaurant) was a far cry from pretty much any other restaurant in the valley (Mexican and otherwise) As for the cost I would put these entrees (and lunch specials even) on the ""expensive"" side of the scale The service was acceptable although I can only suspect the wait staff expects large tips from their hugely inflated bills Sadly they may not get any return customers with the quality of their food the way it is."
4508,0,I revoked my wife's dinner picking privledges after she chose this place This place is clean and means well with the 'organic' and 'green' stuff but that does not make up for the complete lack of quality and flavor in this food First they use Boylan soda products that are beyond disgusting There is a reason that most places use Coke and Pepsi products My diet cola tasted like the smell of bandaids  Second We got the breadsticks with marinara for an appetizer and they were small hard and flavorless bread brushed slightly with oil  Thrid They didn't write our order down and the stuff on our pizza was wrong The pizza was decent size and the pepperoni was thickly sliced which was nice But the sauce was bland and tasted like the sauce from Spaghetti-o's The crust was burnt so much so that my wife and I were having little sword fights with our crust pieces  The staff was super nice and everything but they have some serious issues that will keep us from coming back This place is was overpriced but i guess someone has to pay for the Prius and Smart Car delivery cars.

4301,0,when you walk in the door the color scheme is a lot like jamba juice but they got half way there and stopped  so it is left looking less like a healthfood/smoothie place and more like a commercial doctors office  you have to ask what is in each smoothie as the ingredients are nowhere to be found  I was hoping to see sugar and calorie counts  a large smoothie seems half the size of jambas and cost a lot more  there is a window where you can see the workers in back all having a good time and barely working on your order and I was told the owner was there  the tropical smoothie I got was so so  wont be back.

3800,0,If it were not for the bloody mary and mimosa specialsthere would be no reason to step foot in the new Pischkes (and still I would rather go pay $7 for a mimosa where there is some atmosphere and good food What a shame this used to serve the best breakfast in town and have an hour waitpeople enjoyed having a cocktail at the bar and running into friendsnow it is pretty much seat yourself and enjoy a limited menu  HINT:  Mr McGrath bring back the old menu and foodI love the Roaring Fork and eat there twice a month but this place used to be the best breakfast joint in townbring back the old Pischke's please.

2874,1,Turning 50 has changed my skin a bit and I'm sooooo not ready for this  Where have the last 25 years gone and who took my radiant and youthful skin I want it backI had a consultation with Alison of Face-Labs at a holiday boutique I wasn't expecting much since it's advertised as mineral make up  I used Bare Minerals for many years and loved it - but it's not so great once you start getting fine lines and creases - it actually started accentuating those flaws instead of hiding them  I thought this would be much of the same - but it wasn't  The make-up isn't powder - it's liquid and it's specially mixed and matched to my own skin coloring  You have a choice of how much coverage you want and whether you want a sheer dewy matte etc type of finish  You get a choice of how much coverage you want  It's all mixed to exactly how you want it - with or without sun screen and/or mixed with a primer - so you can skip that step in your super early morning routine  A plus for me since I have to be up at 4 am for work and I am NOT a morning personFor the rest of the day I continued to get complimented on my skin - by strangers even  I'm 50 and people have always thought I was about 15 to 20 years younger than my age - I've been noticing those compliments have been getting fewer and farther between - so it felt good to have people noticing my skin againI have ordered more products and will be happy to review them once I receive and try them but I can't say enough about the foundation  I would absolutely recommend it to anyone looking for coverage made perfect for themAs for Alison she's a sweetheart to work with She is very knowledgeable about her products how to mix them just right and was truly focused on coming up with the easiest routine and best products to meet my goals and expectations  She's a beautiful lady who is fun to work with.

1095,1,I had heard great things about this place and was so excited to try it  Soooooo glad that I did  :) The decor of the place is simple but there is a nice patio seating area so that you can enjoy the weather  I think I was a Pavlovian dog while waiting in line to place my order  I chose two enchiladas one with pork green chili and the other a potato and cornbread mixture  Smothered in a green chili sauce and baked to perfection Definitely add the fried egg on top it makes everything taste yummy.
2295,1,I've been meaning to write a review for Econo Lube for awhile now This is the place we go to service both our cars and we wouldn't go anywhere else These are the type of mechanics that you want They are always honest helpful and friendly They have a bunch of thank you notes up in their waiting room and I believe every single one of them We have been very lucky to find this place.

4864,0,I don't know what all the hype is about this placeI find their deserts pretty disgusting and i have tried numerous ones because so many people rave about them  They have all tasted like metal and the cookies are always dry and hard on the outside and chewy on the inside  I like my cookies to have a consistent textureThey don't have any vegan optionsTheir coffee is horrible  It always tastes burnt and they charge $75 for soy  Most places no longer charge for soy or if they do it is $25  I feel $75 is exorbitantI am done giving this place one more shot.
3989,0,So sorry to report I hade such high expectations and was so disappointed  Packets of mayonnaise Restaurants in Scottsdale do better than that Food quality did not even compare to anything in Hawaii who are your food vendorsWent back tonight and had the fish tacos (because i had a gift card to use up) wow  they were amazing I would so go back and have the fish tacos anytime.
3938,0,"My boyfriend and I were in the area and decided to stop in for brunch At first glance this restaurant looked really dirty and cluttered A couple of tables were filled with diners but there were definitely tables available After a strange and awkward pause the hostess snapped ""Do you have a reservation because these people just sat down and we won't be able to serve you for another 25 minutes"" I have never been treated so rudely by a hostess before She essentially shooed us out of there it wasn't even a matter of being seated it was a matter of being served for another 25 minutes which is not a problem However after feeling so disrespected we quickly left and will definitely never EVER return."
2702,1,"Oh Table Tops how I love thee If I could write a love note to Table Tops I would They are my favorite wedding vendor of all times You know the saying you pay for what you get Well Table Tops was worth every penny and probably more I am truly going to miss working with them on the wedding planning First I will start with the dear owner Melissa Melissa is a life-saver She knows how to deal with confused brides so very well She knows flowers like the back of her hand and she can pick out a type of flower from a scattered description (umm I think they are white and tiny and typically very bridal looking"" Yes Melissa knew the flower based on that description) She is incredibly knowledgeable fun and truly makes a wedding into a beautiful day Table Tops knows quality they know service and they know execution They are like little flower fairies on the day of the wedding They come in create a fairytale wonderland with their floral and decor (if you hire them for decor) and then they leave before you even realize they were there in the first place The quality of their flowers is impeccable and they truly create an atmosphere I had some detailed ideas for my bouquet and Melissa created exactly what I wanted I wanted my bouquet to look vintage chic with my antique family buttons placed throughout it I wanted my wedding dress lace to hold the stem together and I wanted rosary beads hanging from the bouquet She did it By golly she did it and it looks beautiful The saddest part about beautiful wedding flowers is that they only last a day so make sure you take a lot of pictures of Table Tops' workOn another note I would like to share one more story about Table Tops genuine and kind nature On the day of the wedding I showed up to the church and there was a little bit of drama with the management there While trying to get it worked out I was standing alone in the prep room and no one was there to help me with my veil or very long train At that moment one of the Table Top staff who had been in charge of setting up the church flowers introduced herself to me I was a little nervous and flustered and mentioned my concern about my veil and train Without another word she so very kindly fixed both and then stood there and held them for me until I walked down the aisle For that I will be forever grateful to Table Top Not only are their services and talent impeccable but the staff itself is incredibly kind and heartfelt."

3971,0,"Technically I only stayed here for twenty minutes but it was a memorable twenty minutesThe motel sounds amazing: free breakfast a social hour in their ""club"" pool pillow top mattresses flatscreen TVs and a free airport shuttle  But when you actually get there    Let's see: I arranged for the shuttle in advance giving them my arrival time and flight number  And waited and waited  And called the hotel where they seemed to have no idea what I was talking about  So they said they would send the shuttle  The motel is about ten minutes from the airport  It took the guy 45 minutes to pick me up  The shuttle was not clean the seats were split and chunks of foam were coming out the seat belts felt greasy  The driver to be blunt had not showered in days  Then we got to the motel which was clearly a very old motor lodge that had been repainted (you could see faded letters under the paint from the previous name)  Despite having made reservations weeks before and having just called them about the shuttle they did not have a room ready for me    were not sure they had a room for me at all  I sat in the lobby for half an hour waiting while the women at the desk chatted to each other about getting their nails done which is apparently code for finding me a room  The lobby smelled so strongly of cigarette smoke that it made me nauseated after a few minutes and there was ash on several of the chairs  Two teenage girls came in claiming they had lost their room key    after listening to them try to figure out what room they were in and the name of the ""guy they knew who was letting them stay there"" I'm pretty sure they were prostitutes  And judging from the conversation of the desk clerks after they left I'm pretty sure the clerks knew it too BUT THEY GAVE THEM THE SPARE KEY  While I was waiting a friend who had stayed at the motel the night before (we were both in town on business) texted me and said not to check in  She had had a group of teenagers outside her room all night playing music and smoking pot  She'd called the front desk to complain and eventually the police  There had been hair in her shower and something sticky on the sink and she had checked out that morning exhausted and appalled  But right then they said my room was ready so I took the key and went up  The rooms all had outside doors which always makes me feel unsafe when I travel alone and on their website the room pictures are all of inside hallway rooms  The door to my room was bent and didn't close properly I had to lean my full weight against it to get it locked and realized that it was bent that way because it had been kicked in  The room was tiny and smelled like mildew  The bed and bedding appeared to be new but the tiny desk and dresser were very old and scratched  In fact the desk was weird in general: being about four feet wide but not deep enough to set a laptop on   A quick look at the bathroom showed that it had not been cleaned and there was no wastebasket anywhere in the room  I could hear every car passing on the street outside and people talking in the next room as clearly as if they were standing next to me  Oh Hell NoFrom my window I could see the Holiday Inn Express across the street  I called them and found out that their rooms (studio suites no less) were twenty dollars cheaper and made a reservation  I gathered up my things and checked out  They actually tried to charge me but I just LOOKED at the woman and said firmly The room was filthy the door didn't close all the way and nothing here is as advertised and she let me go  I later got an email from the motel with a picture of that same room saying Isn't it clean now  Wouldn't you like to come back  I said no."

1260,1,We got therethere was a waitit was so crowded that some people had to stand to eat their food and it was soooo damn worth itFrom the folk Mexican art depicting Santo and Freda Kahlo's uni-brow to the leather and rough wood La Condesa is as much a treat to the eyes as to the nose and mouthWe are so used to fiery Tex-Mex here in Arizona that it is hard to believe that there is another side to good Mexican fooda delicacy of flavor that counts on subtle textures and refreshing herbs and vegetables to cool our palates and the heat of Southwest daysI tried every one of the salsas available on Saturday and I can still taste the peanut salsa while I dream of the strawberry salsa (and the cilantro cream salsa and the chipotleyou get the picture)We split the dogfish and carne asada tacos along with a mahi burrito and were too stuffed to make our way any farther down the menu guaranteeing we'll be back for moreAny complaints Only the smallest of oneI actually prefer water to soft drinks with my meals and appreciate a reasonably sized cup (I promise I won't steal the Coke) I was given an 8oz styro cup filled with ice necessitating several trips to the counter to ask for more Totally rediculous since the soft drink dispenser is behind the counter and I couldn't rip them off if I wanted to -) and yet another styro cup waiting over a thousand years to biodegrade in a landfillLa Condesa is what a good taqueria should be just make sure to weedle a paper cup out of the cashier if you quieres agua.
496,1,So good came here last week finally with my wife and kids  Place is not what I would call kid friendly but I found myself wanting to drop my kids off at the McDonald's next door for a few hours jk (I don't want CPS coming to my house for that joke)  I had the FEZ burger which is just the most flavorful burger ever while being the most unique burger I have ever eaten  It had BBQ pearsand I cant remember but it was flipping awesome  It is very modern inside my wife loved her salad and our friend had a great tasting sandwich  Kids ate chicken fingers from the bar menu and some sliders from the appetizer menu  All was delish will come again and ditch the kids first (remember this is a joke).
1121,1,What a great surprise This little inconspicuous hole in the wall could be transported directly out of Tokyo Polished concrete floors single white bar simple 2 seater tables and blue neon light to illuminate the white bar chairs The menu not quite the Japanese fare one might be used to No sushi but great little creations like duck and wontons The best part about this place must be the bar A incredible Sake selection and infused vodka buffet If you are into Sake or truly flavoured mixed drinks the bar will be your heaven I am glad I was recommended this place and actually stumbled into it What a great find.
573,1,I was stunned by the quality of the veal chop with apple glaze  Tender flavorful cooked perfectly and beautifully presented with wild rice and arranged asparagus  House wines by the glass were a good accompaniment  The Tiramisu was one of the best I've had  Service was attentive and sitting outside on the patio on a warm fall evening made for nice ambiance  Two of us with wine and one dessert was $75 so a good value as well  My best meal on this trip--wish we had a Italian restaurant like this close to home.
2086,1,Outstanding coffee  Very yummy cookies available   Great coffeehouse atmosphere It's a bit hard to find - no big obvious sign this isn't Starbucks.
2660,1,Very pleased on my first visit to Los Taquitos Very clean casual simple menu and GREAT FOOD My husband and I both ordered the street taco meal absolutely delish The beans were simple but out of this world flavor Staff very kind and quick For 2 dinners and a soda $16 Can't wait to go back and try everything else Los Taquitos has to offer.
3625,0,Went here on two separate occasions once for dinner once for drinks Horrible I'll start with dinner Horrible excuse for Mexican food My husband who loves Mexican wouldn't even finish his burrito and my enchiladas were also gross The food had little flavor and the enchilada sauce was terrible For drinks we went with some friends Our friends ordered a couple of drinks and we bought a round for them We felt as though we were double charged Our waitress brought the manager over and he refused to let us dispute the charge He kicked all of us out and had our check brought outside to us They lost 4 customers for good who typically spend a lot of money over $10 worth of drinks.
2253,0,Oh God this place was awful This is hands down the worst Korean food I have tasted in my life (no exaggeration) This is what Korean food would probably taste like in rural North Dakota (no offense North Dakotans) I really have nothing good to say about this place This place is expensive and serves significantly smaller portions than typical korean restaurants The $15 seafood pancake (which had very little seafood and  tasted very fishy/gross) was half the size of what would typically served The $10 soft tofu stew was bland and came in a very small pot (almost like a small bowl) the beef in there was extremely toughOur server (very likely the owner) was inattentive and stingy with side dishes we had to ask him to refill twice because it was simply not enough The portions started off small but only got smaller and smaller as we asked for moreIf you want decent korean food drive a few miles south to Hodori.
2446,1,Excellent food  Best steak in town.
2557,1,The workers here were super friendly The food is on par with any other Jamba Juice The place was clean employees were super nice kept me company during an incredibly short wait (could have been because it was midday friday and raining) and even gave me a sweet coupon for next time.
3226,0,Atmosphere was funky  We went last week with two gift certificates from Sunflower Markets  When our server finally came with extra sighs and huffs of over-work blithering Before greating us looked at the gift certificates sitting on the table and said 'you can't use those both here'--it's the rules of the owners  So I asked are we allowed to split checks at a table--'no'  We can't really comment on the foodthe staffer was so rude about it that we actually walked out(We have tried the location at PV Mallwe had a great experience with the atmosphere and serverfood was okay: salad-good GF pizza-below average).
1044,0,I'm not sure why everyone loves this place  Maybe it's the gigantic portions of meat they serve  I was not impressed by the veggie section of the menuoh wait there's not oneand no I don't like oatmeal or f-ing grapefruit for breakfast  ick  I've waited in line once--that'll be enough for me Matt.
4123,0,Quick summaryburned funnel cake dry turkey leg soggy hot dogs that were literally grey old watery lemonade passed off as a lemon shake up overpriced items from Ecuador and Mexico for sale no desirable rides basically a complete waste of time and money  Can you make memories  Surebut a better classification would be regrets.
2243,1,I live close enough to Joe's to be tortured daily by the enticing aroma the smoker emits My family can pick up dinner here for less than we can at Micky D's (If we don't order drinks) so we often opt for BBQ if we are going to eat out The food is amazing the staff is always friendly and the location can't be beat I can't wait to try Liberty Market and the Farm Grill.
4725,0,What type of bar serves drinks in a thimble you ask  THIS ONE  What a freaking rip off  Sure the waitresses were hot but in Zona apparently all of the girls are hot  Well at least in the 5 mile radius  They must grow because of the sun  They probably use photosynthesis  The atmosphere wasn't too bad but it was your typical bar with typical bar food with typical douchebags  Solid one star for the rip off drink amounts.
2802,1,My new favorite pizza place  The pizza here is delicious  There's nothing fancy about the pizza it's just good  I order the ham and pepperoni pizza along with 12 wings  It's a special they have for I think 1399  The wings are just fine but I'm not really that crazy about wings all together   It takes about 45 minutes to be delivered  The delivery boys are very polite  I will continue to order from them for now on.
1025,1,I could not be happier with this preschool My first child is going to graduate to kindergarten this year and my second will be in the 3's class next year  The teachers are outstanding  After researching so many other preschools the thing about this preschool that makes it stand out is the community and the parent education  As a first time parent not only was I not ready to send my child off to school and not be part of it but there was so much I didn't know  Since this school is a co-op I was able to carry through with what my son learned at school and reinforce it at home  I learned so much from the expert teachers  In addition I have formed close bonds to the other co-oping parents  I can't think of a better way to model a sense of community to my children than to actually live it  The school offers a developmentally appropriate curriculum and allows children to learn through play  I could go on and on about this school and it's community.
3982,0,Unfortunately you cannot give negative stars  Pizza was so late I would have had to order it 2 days ago for it to get here on time  From the time I ordered till delivery was 1 hour and 45 minutes  Got the pizzas free but there barely warm and soggy bottoms  As far as I am concerned they should give us the next 4 orders free  I would go elsewhere but we like Dominoes Pizza  Our previous complaint was about the manager who insisted he could not give us the order free well we got the order free tonight so the Manager Singh is a liarmy previous complaintOne very nasty and rude manager named Singh  WILL NOT LET A CUSTOMER COMPLAIN AND VENT  All he has are excuses  Hello I am a customer let me vent then ask me what can he do to correct this  Nope he has to interrupt you  This man needs a course in customer service  t hate the service.
2570,1,I'll never use another cheapy online tax program again after coming here These guys are awesome and did you know paying to have your taxes done is deductible on your taxes next year I didn't know that They helped my girlfriend and I figure out our complicated taxes and ended up getting us back several hundred dollars more than if we had done them online like we usually do They've earned a customer for life.
1579,1,I've been here a couple of times and I recieved great service everytime I give this five stars for a combination of things  Food is great the waiters are helpful yet not pushy like other places that come around so often you can't even enjoy your meal  great place for dinner  you might want to make a reservation depending on the night though.
4113,0,The staff sucks and the food is overrated  Too bad because it is a cool place  Fire everyone and start over.
2810,1,Let me start by saying that i am a die hard MAC fan only ever used MAC and am a total snob about it BUT now that i have basically every shade of their lipgloss and lipstick- i thought it was time to venture out of my little boxI got a MUA named Julian and he was AhhhhhMazzzinngggg We spent about an hour just playing with different makeup and he created a whole new look for me PLUS we made it budget friendly which was an added bonus Even the other MUA's were coming over to watch him work his magic on me I had so much fun AND got a new look I already set up another time to go in and see him for another mini makeover.
2504,1,Sat at the bar Ordered the tostada appetizer which was delicious Also had the pork shoulder tacos that are cooked for 10 hours Very yummy The mission is very romantic with darker lighting I highly recommend it.
489,1,Yes-- really digging the art that's hung there-- such a cool little place.
854,1,Where can you go in Arizona to get the best cheesesteak   here of course sure the lines are long at times but totally worth the wait  Aside from the perfect amount of whiz on your sandwich there are a plethora of adds to throw on to create the perfect sammich like like like.
1920,1,HOTEL:The resort grounds are gorgeous  Unfortunately I did not have a great opportunity to roam the area since I was there for a work conference  The views are beautifulThe lobby is spacious and inviting with complementary iced tea and cooled water as soon as you walk through the doors  This is replicated throughout the common areas of the hotel (at least away from the lounge and restaurants) since it is so hot and dry  I found this to be a nice part of my stay given the need for frequent rehydration shows some level of caring about my stay by the hotelThe lounge area off the lobby is roomy and comfortable with outside seating also available  The bar area is a lightly staffed if there is a large conference but seems adequate for the usual level of lounge guestsRooms are spacious and comfortable  Beds are medium in hardness with a plethora of pillows I did note that there were several different grades of stiffness to my pillows not sure if this was planned or just luck  I do notice these things since I am not a soft mattress or pillow kind of person  The bathroom has a separate shower and tub for soakingThe concierge staff was extremely helpful in picking out restaurants and with transportation  All staff members were polite and helpfulThe only drawback to my stay was that the Marriott does not have free wifi internet instead it is a pay ethernet service in your room or a paid wifi in the conference area  This seems to be a Marriott thing rather then a site particular quirkCONFERENCE AREA:This was a small to medium sized conference I attended and went throughs several meetings in all the different areas  I found the conference rooms to be well maintained with a good AV system that was brought in and set up  The computers ran well for presentations and the projectors that were obtained were excellent  The bulbs were in good working condition so the presentations were not washed out or faded in appearance especially when showing darker images with subtle pointsThe acoustics were adequate depended on which particular room you were in at the time but none were bad  The audio system with the wireless microphone system worked well with minimal to no feedback (instances were more presenter problems then equipment problems)I felt that the conference area was excellent and I was happy with the presentations I attended and gave from a logistics standpoint  There was always staff present to assist should there be a problemThe drawback was again no free wifi for the conference although you can pay for conference wifi and give attendees a code for free (to them) access my conference did notThe disclaimer is that I am not sure how much of the conference set up was handled by the Marriott and how much by the organization holding the conference.
1666,1,"This was a Groupon gamble for me After visiting the website the thought crosses your mind as if this will be a good idea for a non Korean but I figure this is Phoenix I love karaoke and so do my friends I have nothing to lose so ""Buy Now"" it is Go figure I wait until it practically expires but our roommates b-day was coming up so we figure perfect timing You have to reserve the room in advance which I did online and set everything up though a couple emails (they were very responsive) Note: This place caters to ASU students pretty hard core so it's fairly empty in the Summer and you might be able to get away with not reserving At this point I'm the only one who has dealt with the biz so we pull up with all our friends and the place looks closed We walk in and its completely empty but an employee walks out confirms my name and takes us to a room He gives me a quick ""how to"" on the machine and off we go ***Here are 3 main reasons why you should try this place over Guitar Hero at home*****1 You can bring your own liquor We just bought the sodas from them and mixed it all ourselves 2 They have tambourines and maracas in the room Adds to the fun for people who are not singing and when was the last time you used a tambourine or maraca3 The experience I don't know of any strictly karaoke places in the valley Another group or two showed up and we all kept crossing paths when we had to order more drinks go to the bathroom and by the end of the night I was having shots with one of the guys from the other room Everyone in our group had a blast The setup was all there with the 2 mics speakers laser lights our own liquor What else do you need Protip: Plan on taking a taxi home so everyone can drink and you'll unleash a whole other level of fun."
1062,1,Love this place Toddy is fantasimoso atmosphere is way too cool for me staff is friendly and remember you For something different try a Dirty Iced Chai Tea which is also amazirocking +1 for free wifi parking can be difficult if you are cool ride your bikeUpdate: I've fallen in love with black coffee because of this place Thanks Cartel for my new obsession.
3785,0,After 3 weeks my Galaxy S4 decided to stop charging I came in and was helped by David after plugging it in and realizing it wasn't going to charge said we need to figure out if it's a battery issue or a problem with the charging port He asked a co-worker Gina if he could borrow her battery for a minute so we could have a definitive answer She said NO (in a really rude tone) and explained that I'll need to wipe my phone to see if it still doesn't work I told her I needed to be able to make sure my G Cloud backed up my phone plus wiping it with 6% battery life would cause the phone to shut off in the middle of it and brick my phone a chance she thought I should take Well even if I could wipe it without bricking it I'm not going to just wipe my phone if it's a battery issue She said they don't have any batteries laying around I said well he asked if we could use yours real quick and you said no she then rolled her eyes and walked away I asked her to come back so we could keep discussing this but she refused David apologized and said he shouldn't have put her on the spot like that He was just trying to think outside the box and come up with a quick solution to my phone not charging So he went to talk to the manager to see if she had any ideas In the mean time I went over to the display phones took the battery out and put it in my phone plugged it in and got the answer we needed It's the port not the battery I could hear the manager yelling at Davideveryone could He got yelled at for asking Gina to borrow her battery and for allowing me to take the battery out of a phone He didn't tell me to do it I did it all on my own since his co-workers and manager were completely worthless Since I purchased it at Costco ($70 cheaper plus awesome accessories) I had the option of having them send me a new one or just exchanging it at Costco I obviously went that route I called Verizon Customer Service today about my incident last night and they took it very seriously Especially since I had a billing error and the manager was supposed to correct it and she never did I highly commend David for doing whatever he could to help me Gina and the manager on duty were rude and absolutely worthless.
88,1,The food is excellent I am very picky and I had read the Yelp reviews of others before trying out this place I got the eel bowl which consists of eel slices with a delicate sauce over rice I chose brown rice My husband got the chicken teriyaki He was very pleased with it We will definitely be going back There are a number of items on the menu that I am looking forward to getting The food was prepared perfectly The atmosphere was comfortable and the service was nice.
3,1,Great sushi rolls and BYOB  Very friendly staff  Three for lunch $25 per person including a generous tip  Love this place.
2365,1,I worked here for about a year from 2006-2007 but I swear I'm not biasedSakana has the freshest fish and I can vouch that the chefs and supervisors take trips to California to pick it up fresh and they also get some of it from BC The service is always great as well as fast and the restaurant is clean The staff is always loud and fun and I recommend sitting at the bar and conversing with the sushi chef Masa if you get the chance He's a complete riotAlso if the 108 degree fahrenheit roll is on special order it The flavors and sauce are unbelievable I used to love it before I went fully vegetarian and still to this day that is one of the few non-veg things I crave.
2932,1,Fast friendly service I wondered how they would treat me since I'm female and they have always taken the time to explain things to me They came out and replaced my sand filter They were on time very clean about their work and the work matched my quote Here's to the mom & pops that are still around and beating the big box competition in all areas Thank you B&L.
2244,1,"All I can say is ""Wow""I tried these guys because they had a booth set up at Denim and Diamonds  Oh myI am so glad I tried the brisket sandwich  It was warm drippy barbecued delightfulness  I highly recommend a trip to this eatery  You will not be let down  I would drive from Tempe Chandler or even Scottsdale for another sandwich."
4926,0,I had a layover in Phoenix on Friday September 21st so I decided to get some food from Paradise in order to take on my next flight I ordered 1/2 of the southwest ceasar salad and 1/2 turkey sandwich on wheat in addition to a lemon poppysead muffin I ate the muffin and salad with no incident On the plane (after takeoff) I unwrapped my sandwich  and wedged inside the bottom portion of the bread and otherwise not visible unless the entire sandwich was unwrapped was a huge STAPLE I couldn't believe that there was a staple inside my sandwich If I had not unwrapped the sandwich and examined it (to determine if there was mayo on it) I could have been seriously injured by ingesting this at 30000 feet Take a close look before eating anything from here.
2383,1,Expert service Exceptional food every time Beautiful ambiance.
2526,1,I just attended this family owned shop My wife and I took in our African grey named cocoa From the first step we took in  We were greated and felt very welcomed Omar was nice enough to share his passion of birds with us He helped us and educated us on our grey  We are definitely becoming regulars  because he took the time to talk to us about our bird and not try to push us to buy anything  Omar is great and birdz and beyond is a great family business.
1077,1,The paletas are very delicious and they remind me of home in MexicoI tried the nuez (pecan) and the mango with chile Both were very goodI definitely think is worth checking them out specially when you see a line over 10 people waiting at the Tempe storeOne suggestion have more flavors available.
194,1,RDT I love this place I have been training here a little over a year and I'm still learning new things The classes are fun and a great workout but but the redman classes are my favorite If you are looking for a real self defense class and don't mind some good exercise at the same time this is the place for you.
4144,0,Um Okay  That pretty much sums up my experience with Dave and Busters  I would not recommend this place unless you are into playing arcade games    I went with some coworkers and their spouses  We chose D&B because we thought it would a fun way to bond as a team  We started off with dinner The menu looked promising for American style food and then it came out  Nothing was tasty not even the French fries who screws up French fries  Okay so we didn't go there for the food we went there for the games and such  We were told that it was an adult atmosphere and by adults  I can only assume they meant over  13  The only activities centered towards adults were the pool tables which had a 3 hour wait  Also the whole upstairs was shut down for a private party  We played a few arcade games to use up our $20 of purchased tickets while drinking a watered down rum and coke and then headed to Cadillac ranch.
1426,0,"This is one of the worst McD's I've been to (unfortunately closest to my house) and it seems like the reason why is management In the 5 years I've been going here I've had many incorrect orders been overcharged several times had inconsistent or poorly made food/coffee been treated rudely when trying to get problems corrected I've had to wait FOREVER because of understaffing (or maybe they're just that bad) A couple times they asked me to pull ahead at the drive-thru and wait for them to bring my food out to me Both times it was clear that I had been forgotten I didn't order much at all and watched for 10+ minutes while people behind me drove off with their food and drink I actually had to call and remind them I was still waiting The icing on the cake is I just found out they raised the price of the McWrap from $399 to $499 the only McD's in the area that has done this So you know what I'm done with this location If I absolutely had to have McD's again it'll be somewhere else Whoever owns this franchise needs to get a clueOne last tip to this location Try putting an adequate amount of sauce/mayo on stuff so people don't have to order it with extra which sometimes backfires when you actually get ""extra"" (better than not enough IMO but still way too much) Seriously you want me to come back behind the counter and teach everyone what a ""normal"" amount of sauce looks like It's not hard people."
2476,1,"We have a Siberian Husky who must run around This is a great dog park It is a wonderful City of Phoenix service at no extra cost Parking is close There are bags and trash cans for the ""doggie deposits"" Luckily there are trees for shade and chairs for the doggie parents to relax in Our dog really enjoys herself here Recommend."
1465,1,Portillo's- WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN ALL MY LIFE Oh that's right Chicago I am so glad this amazing chain migrated its way to PHX They have so many different hotdogs hamburgers Italian sandwiches to choose from I got the Jumbo hotdog (minus the peppers-ew) and ate every bite of it I also got the cheese fries which I liked that they put the cheese on the side- that way the ooey gooey delicious cheese could be evenly distributed on each individual fry We actually had to get more fries so we could finish the cheese in it's entirety I warn you people if you go to Portillo's prepare to become an addict and wanting it all the time I plan on going back tonight.
4184,0,Why did did i come back here  a 40 min drive north for what  with 200 fantastic places near me i certainly do NOT have to drive to be treated like a LEPER by a snotty uppity arogant serverWhen we walked into the bar area the entire bar was empty  For seating there were 2 tables: 1 person seated at a table 2 at the other  The girl behind the bar acted frenzied hurried and like she wsa serving 37 people  NO TIME FOR US - who were NOT LOCALS   was the crisp and very clear messageThe CRAP wine by the glass advertised on the chalk board was enough to send me running out the door: $5/glass for what is sold for the bottle retail (gnarly head voga 3 rivers - KAK)I went over to the wine rack and she said the Long Meadow Cab was on sale instead of $60 she offered it for $45  Since I had not had it previously i was hesitant  But I spotted a 1/2 bottle so (i thought) i was in luck  I asked her how much (thinking it would be HALF of the full bottle - like $22)   NOT  She said it was also the same price   W T H   are you kidding meHusband walked out i followed (especially after seeing her treat another 2 walk in's in a deplorable way - no reason to treat people like they are beneath you - EVER).
1496,1,Taco Tuesdays are great and excellent prices A must go for taco Tuesday New favorite place.
3014,1,Tott's reminds me of my favorite Chinese eatery in Chicago: Friendship RestaurantEverything tastes fresh and the boxed presentation of to-go foods is top notchMy favorite menu item for only $625 is the sampler plate Three spring rolls four pot stickers and four cheese puffs with dipping sauces come in a box on a bed of lettuce Everything is perfectly cooked with a touch of firmness on the pot stickers cheese puffs with crunchy tips and soft bodies and spring rolls that taste like springNo MSG Pure vegetable oil Trimmed meats to reduce fat and an open kitchen so you can watch the cooksEasily my favorite fast Chinese in Arizona.
4461,0,"Where do I been  I called in a to-go order and had the pleasure of speaking with Ronnie the manager  For a manager Ronnie was rude and has very poor customer service skills  We over looked her behavior and decided to order anyway because we had received good service in the past and everyone is entitled to a bad day   To our surprise some of the order was wrong The pork noodle soup came with chicken instead of pork  Not what we ordered but we could live with other white meat  We also ordered Kung Pao Chicken one with peanuts and one without (the one supposedly without nuts was clearly marked ""NO PEANUTS"")  Thank God the person that she was sharing the Kung Pao Chicken with who is deathly allergic to nuts did not fix her plate first (Peanut allergies can be life threatening)  We called Siu Wok to complain I again had the pleasure of speaking with Ronnie and her poor customer service skill  First she said there was no way the Kung Pao Chicken had peanuts because they where cooked in two different pans This of course was not the case Ronnie did not offer any solutions  I had to request she replace our order with the correct food  Sadly when the delivery guy came back with our corrected order his attitude was just as bad as Ronnie's  I asked to speak with Ronnie's manager  I am still waiting on that call  All I have to say is eating at Sui Woks can be deadly  We will never order from there again."
2732,1,Ahh I went here one day and took a whole 2 hours to go back again This place was great I found curtains for my house for a whopping 12 bucks (for both panels) And books games the whole shebang Yeah I agree with Jessica on wanting to save this little secret of mine but man oh man I spent so many hours at antique stores and totally neglected the real deal Definitely recommended or not recommended if you're going for any size 6s.
1868,1,Excellent food Excellent service and great ambience Will definitely come back on my next trip to Arizona.
2349,0,"I don't eat meat so I probably shouldn't have gone here My husband got the ""Arizona"" burger and really enjoyed it I went with the vegetarian burger which is basically black beans smashed together I do like black beans but I don't like black beans with mustard pickles and onion on top of a bun I enjoyed the rosemary & olive oil fries but not enough for me to come back a second timeOur total was $1500 and that was not money well spent."
1919,1,I absolutely love Dr Finley She sits down with you and answers ALL of your questions always Not like your typical doctor who comes in does whatever you have scheduled and then leaves Dr Finley will sit down and answer all of your questions about your symptoms on that day or other symptoms you had last week She takes the time to explain things to you and genuinely cares about her patientsI have been seeing Dr Finley for years I have followed her to this new practice and will follow her if she moves again I recommend Dr Finley to anyone who asks She is great honest and genuinely cares I am aware that the Doctor can't control the paperwork that is required and needed on file and updated annually That kind of administrative stuff is left to the owner of the practice I also understand that Dr Finley didn't set up the prescription policy either again that is up to whomever owns the practice and their legal team I completely understand that it takes staff and Dr Finley's time and a lot of it to constantly be calling in new prescription For the amount of patients the practice has it has got to take up most of there day going back and forth with RPH and verifying the script gets there etc I don't mind coming in 4 times a year for the Dr to verify my symptoms and that I still need my maintenance medications  I wanted to touch base on Amber H negative comments:Yes her front desk person could smile more But she is in no way rude If you read my other reviews you know I don't stand for rude LOL Yes the pretesting is not in a closed patient room I've never been to an office that weighs you AND takes your BP in a closed patient  room Pre-testing is always done out in the open but behind the wall separating the lobby from the PT rooms in any doctors office I've been to  Maybe the BP is taken in a room usually although I have never been weighed and had my temp taken in the patient room Again this is not reflective of Dr Finley but of the owner of the practice and their desires As for the waiting when you are a new patient you come in early and you will see people showing up after you and going in before you because they dont have to come in early for paperwork I can tell you that when I come in for my scheduled visits as an established patient I never wait more than 5 min past my appointment time I would and DO recommend Dr Finley to all of my co-workers (as she is in network) and all of my friends who are in need of a new doctor.
2922,1,I love Judith at Foxtail Salon I really am not a fan of obligatory chatter when getting my hairs cut but Judith is interesting funny intelligent warm and friendly and I enjoyed my time at this salon All this and she is also great hair stylist She made my hair super soft pretty and cute and smell good for a reeeeeeally good price The salon is easily accessible small bright fashionable cute and clean You do have to pay to park though if you park in the lot infront of the salon  I am moving out of the state soon and sad I can't take Judith with me.
440,1,Great atmosphere inside but even better out  The food is always good though I believe the food and drink are a little over priced  Service has been hit or miss during our visits but generally okay.
435,1,"Large Asian market in fact the best I have found in Arizona  Being originally from the bay area in California I miss some oriental foods I grew up with  I found most everything from my childhood here  It also has fresh produce and a variety of meats that I have experimented with  It also has other imports at this store and if you are looking for something ""different"" this market is the place to goAlso if you are craving BOBA drinks they have a small shop to the right as you enter."
2772,1,I hate scorpions Hate them But I live in AZ so I'm bound to encounter the evil creatures however more than 15 inside my house were 15 too many I have 3 young children and I was terrified for them I had another company (Ky-Ko) come to seal our house and I won't bore you with the details but in short:  They didn't sealed every thing as detailed in their 25 point check list  incredibly poor work on what they actually sealed plus cheap materials and bad customer service Excuses and more excusesNot wanting to deal with them anymore and desperate I called SOS They came today and I'm so impressed They sealed my doors perfectly they resealed my vents  (previously sealed with duct tape Really) sealed every nook and cranny  they even changed light bulbs for meThey were extremely professional and knowledgeable about anything scorpions Mike Bill Mike Kyle and I forgot the other guy's name (sorry) were all a pleasure to have in my house They recommend pest control spraying regimens either a company or if you want to DIYThey may be a little more expensive than other companies but they are worth every single penny and moreI can sleep better now.
1009,1,i love this theater  usually quiet in the AM if you like to take advantage of their $5 before noon promotion  they validate parking and the staff is normally pretty nice  my bf and i will normally hit up an early movie then stick around and grab lunch at one of the restaurants near by.
2118,1,My daughter has been at Mountain View Christian Preschool since she was 4 months old (She's 20 months now) and I can't say enough about how much I love this daycare The church is Christian however the daycare curriculum is non-denominational Every single person at the daycare is passionate and cares immensely about children I know that when I leave my daughter there that she is going to be loved just as much as if I cared for her myself I've never had any doubts that this was the right choice for her and I'll keep her at Mountain View until I either move out of the area or she goes off to kindergarden The facilities are clean bright and newer and they have a nice playground with a shaded covering for playtime There happens to be a house right behind it that has mini-horses goats and sheep so the kids can watch the animals through the fence but they can't put their hands through It's sort of like having a zoo right in the backyard They do water play days during the summer with the hose and buckets and those are by far one of my daughter's favorite activies My daughter has gone through the infant room to the infant 2 room and now the toddler room and the developmental level and curriculum has been stimulating for her and she's learned so many new things The spend a lot of time coloring reading books doing art projects and learning to say please and thank you There hasn't been a TV in any of the rooms she was in so I know they're not just plopping her down in front of a video all dayI know every teacher there by name and the school arranges potluck dinners and get togethers so the parents can meet each other They make a real effort to make the daycare a community center instead of just a business Overall this place is the best I pay a little more to have her at Mountain View than I would have at other daycares but you just can't go cheap on something like this When I was pregnant I checked out tons of less expensive daycares in the area and was pretty scared Mountain View Preschool does NOT take DES vouchers and the clientele seems to be a little more upscale because of that This place is worth every penny and I recommend it to everyone I know.
1511,1,"I'm long overdue for a review for this place - my favorite bar in Arizona As a craft beer fan (I try not to say ""snob"") I'm overwhelmed with a place with this good a selection of beers that I've never tried before or are worth trying again In addition to the ones they brew themselves (which are quite good) they also have a terrific selection of locals and from elsewhere on draft I get sample sizes when  I have the time a pint when I don't Happy hour is $6 for a pitcher (roughly 25 pints) for local Arizona brews I've been here for happy hours dinners and late drinks with friends and have had a quality experience every time To their credit for a craft beer place they have a decent selection of mixed drinks and some wines For food I've been pleased with chicken sandwiches (very tender) the Sunday all-you-can-eat bbq and appetizers The food is decent enough given that the focus is on the beer (in my opinion) Servers have been quite knowledgeable about the beers Atmosphere is kick-back casual with a bright interior with various types of places to sit - booths bar tables patio Patio is dog-friendly Parking can be tight but I've parked across the (rather busy) street (ie across Indian School) and it's not that big a deal  So far the only matches for beer selection are World of Beer (Tempe and Gilbert) Angel's Trumpet (which has no happy hour and the food is so-so at best) and 1702 (Tucson)."
261,1,It definitely is as good as it gets I drive from NW Valley every Wed for produce Great choice fresh and yummy And the prices  wouldn't get better deal even if Walmart had such great organic produce Out of all farmers markets in the Valley this one is by far my favorite.
1644,1,Lot s of Chick-fil-a stores around and all have the same food which is very good BUT this one on Stapley has got to be judged by the perfect service and their great people Even when the place is packed you will be eating within 5 minutes and they will even bring it to your table When you are ready to leave they ask if they can take your take tray for you and are always cleaning and getting ready for the next customer AND they will come around and ask if they can refill your drink for youIT DON'T GET ANY BETTER THAN THISMy assessment--chicken is chicken but the PEOPLE MAKE THE DIFFERENCE HERE Ted Christy is the ownerSouth of hwy 60 on Stapley at Inverness I moved into an office right behind them and love the locationBOB  STEPHENS.
2591,0,This review has nothing to do with the food We have eaten at Famous Dave's in the past and was very pleased However we stopped by for lunch and had our dog with us I politely asked the Hostess if the patio was dog friendly for a well trained dog She asked the bartender who said noonly Service Dogs The patio is huge and no one was out there I think this is the first patio at a restaurant that we have been denied and IS NOT DOG FRIENDLY For that Famous Dave's you get 1 star Red Robin across the street gladly accommodated us.
1215,1,Ever since the Pasta Bar closed down i have been on the search for a local Italian joint with a very welcoming menu and Cuoco Pazzo deliveredThe menu is unpretentious  The service is very friendly  The owner comes out to check on his guest and strikes a conversation What keeps me REALLY coming back is that the food has great flavor and doesn't even try  I've been to restaurants where you taste the food and its like they are trying very hard to make it taste amazing   At Cuoco Pazzo it comes together very nicelyDefinitely a must go.
4297,0,Horrible service  Walked in and was told there was a 1005 minute wait Sat down and saw people getting seated that came in after I did Walked up and the hostess She said sorry you're next The service sucks here Night was ruined before I got my food.
4950,0,NASTY Manager should be looking around at his dirty restaurant instead of making small talk with his employees I've never been to a Sweet Tomatoes in such horrible condition I hope we don't get sick from eating here tonightAtmosphere was aweful too Industrial looking and unfinished looking What's with the big screen TVs at some tables running sweet tomato ads the whole timeI LOVE Sweet Tomatoes but I will be bookmarking this location as a Don't Ever Go There Again place.
1629,0,I don't understand how this place is still in business I recently got a online membership here without visiting the gym first big mistake on my part Im disgusting to even enter the sauna how this place is still open to the public is unknown to me I will be canceling my membership effective tomorrow I will pay a few more dollars at LA Fitness but well worth the extra bucks.
4563,0,Defiantly no where near an authentic Chicago dog Grilled bun and jumbo dog cut in half Won't be having anotherFries were good Next time I'll try Italian bee and burger and see if those can save the place.
1998,1,The Najaf sauce was excellent We loved the enchiladas and the nachos It was so gooood Love the margarita mugs too Definitely will go back.
3213,0,They should write a book about how to ruin a soft taco  I didn't think it was possible  The corn tortilla was raw not sauteed or warmed up at all and thus tasted like cardboard  The whole thing was cold  The only good thing was the rice which was very tasty  A woman at the table next to us warned us that her chicken taco was horrible  So why didn't we listen  We figured it was just the chicken but we should have asked more.
3110,0,We had dinner there last evening 1/22/14  Service was very good from our server who was from Sicily   Foodnot so much although the spinach salad with goat cheese was excellent  Having just returned from Italy we were hungry for more of what we experienced in dining  We had gnocchi with a walnut sauce that was horrid and inedible gray sauce with potato lumps pretending to be gnocchi  The Orecchietta w/sausage pasta was tough and not cooked properly and the red sauce which was suppose to be a pepperoncino spicy sauce appeared to be the bland drain off a can of tomato sauceWe did not stay for dessert.
1872,1,The only place where movies are the most important thing in the world A legitimate 1990's dingy poorly lit video rental store Amazing.
2273,1,The negative complaints about this place are all about the prices here The food is awesome Fried pickles are some of the best I've ever had Support your local restaurants and pay the extra buck or two It's going to be better than chilli's I promise.
1061,1,BEST burger I've had in a LONG time Great service but still laid back and the NFL ticket Can't say enough how amazing the food it though.
1253,1,Great service at this store Ask for Ryan He's the best.
3829,0,We went here three times in the last 6 months each time hoping it would be better and more like the location on Indian School and Dysart where we had previously visited It wasn't I got a combo platter each time and each time parts of the plate were literally unedible The tamale was overcooked to death The chile rellano had nothing in it and was dried out And for over $8 it should be much better than thatThe last time my husband complained of an upset stomach that night and next day We will not return to this location.
2640,1,BEST CHEESE-STEAK IN ARIZONA  BEST MEATBALL SUBS IN THE WESTI am from New Jersey and have eaten all up and down the east coast  this place is a real jewel only authentic italian deli i have found here in arizona Try the cheesesteak on the italian baguette (crispy outside soft inside)  Pasta deli you can't go wrong here It's important to understand that everything is home made and takes time  more than you may think approx 15-20 minutes for most orders CALL YOUR EAT IN ORDER AHEAD OF TIME- then you will love coming here often  they sell limited quantities of pizza dough daily to make at home  it's amazing and cheap.
1327,0,"A 40 mile round trip drive only to be told by the snotty butcher that you can only buy stuff that is listed on their web site as for sale if you're on ""The List""  Yeah no thanks I'll just keep going to Hobe Meats and ordering stuff onlineIf you do decide to bother with this place call ahead Just because they have it on their web site with a price next to it apparently doesn't mean it's actually for sale  While calling also ask how to get put on ""The List"" because that info isn't on their site either."
1378,0,"This was my second visit to Arriba's and believe me it wasn't my choice I spent the first 26 years of my life in Southern New Mexico and I miss the food like CRAZY especially green chile When you walk into Arriba's it's New Mexico this and New Mexico that and the dishes are named after cities and landmarks in the stateWhen we told the waitress that in New Mexico green chile sauce doesn't have pork in it she said ""Well we say that but it's not *really* New Mexican"" and walked off WhatThe first time there we mentioned this to a Manager and got the same exact reaction I also asked if I could get a side of plain green chile and was told no Both times we were being super nice and just trying to start a friendly conversation had these interactions been better this review wouldn't be hereI'm far from being a vegetarian I don't eat pork or beef because I don't like it Also I didn't ask about the red chile sauce because I'm not a fan maybe it's porkless and amazing but I can't speak for thatI ordered the Santa Fe Chicken salad  Iceberg lettuce slimy greens cooked onions and bell peppers mushy tomatoes half melted greasy cheese clumps and very dry chicken piled on a shell yuck If it wasn't for the delicious fresh chips guacamole and two 99cent happy hour margaritas I would've been VERY unhappy  I definitely won't ever be back and this time I mean it."
2692,1,Heck yay All the reviews below are spot on but I'll throw my two cents in I had the lunch special (Magic Mushroom Burger) and ordered my son a basic cheeseburger We both chowed down Fries were a bit salty but the burgers were bestest And the $5 lunch special is toppermostThe counter guys even had little airplanes for my kids to play with while we waited for our order We sat on the back porch out of the sun and had a great lunch Will visit again when I'm around.
1364,1,This Starbucks has some of the friendliest people of any Starbucks I've ever been to They are incredibly nice and they always make my drink perfectly Love it.
1955,1,"Great ""quick service"" Mexican food  Nothing too fancy the food here is great  Line can be long at times so I always call the order in about 10 minutes before I get there  Not everything is amazing but their best items can't be beat  In my opinion here are their items in order of awesomeness:1) Marinated Pork Burrito1a) Shrimp Taco (Fish is great too)2) Bombero Burrito  (very spicy so watch out)After those it's all about personal taste  Great place high recommended."
4124,0,I was in AZ for a family trip so I searched on Yelp for a good Thai restaurant to eat  Chanpen Thai Cuisine in the result with 45 stars  So I can't here on 08/28/13 to try the food out  It is a small house/building Inside it is soooo small & only have a couple of small tables We orded 3 dishes the drunken noodle the pai thai and the beef salad The waiter aka 1 man does all he's the cashier the bust boy the order man Omg it take forever for him to come to our table & take the order the next worst part is the food take about 40minutes to come Omg & the worst part is the food is so horrible the noodle in the pai & the drunken noodle was all mushy/over cooked The meat in all the dishes are not fresh & tasted weird The beef salad was sooo salty It's very pricey & it is the worst Thai food I have ever eat Omg what a wasted of money & timeI will never never stop by here ever again when I'm in the area They need to improve the food or shame on them for calling those horrible dishes Thai food.
2107,0,"Decided to give it a try ""which was the first mistake"" got a burger with bacon and cheese Its amazing that how you can take a patty of beef and scare out all the flavor so it resembles something like ground up cardboard The bacon seemed like it was sitting around for 3 days I had to overpay for this I wont be back."
4363,0,"Absolutely horrible service twice The first time they told my mother to come right down and they could take her right back I raced home from work and met her there where they said we will take you back in a few minutes One and a half hours later they took her It would have been fine had they said that from the beginning but you don't tell people ""right back"" and then have it be 15 hours Second time we had an appointment and got there and after waiting 30 minutes past the appointment time someone came out and said it would be another 45 minutes So what exactly was the point of the appointment I am wondering No one ever apologized either time and said they were running behind or anything In the future when we need x-rays/MRI's we will be looking for a new place to go Service here is just unacceptable."
3022,1,"My wife and I went here on our bi-weekly date night a few months ago I da just gotten back from France and was still feeling good about my culinary experience I was a little hesitant at first to believe that an American place could match the flavors that I enjoyed oh so much while in Paris However Petite Maison far exceeded my expectations I had the dry vac'd steak (I don't remember what it was called but it was the special of the day) and it was ""Holy Shit"" good After dinner we had some cheese and a glass of wine The cheese was amazing They had all sorts of choices to chose from We had the sampler so we were able to taste something like 6 different cheesesIf you have $75+ and want to have a great meal with your significant other go to Petite Maison You WILL NOT be disappointed  My only complaint was that my meal had to end."
2709,1,The staff here is simply amazing Kelly at the front desk and Jillian went above and beyond the call of duty helping me with a request I really appreciated their help Thank you.
4971,0,Way to go Essence After a few awful experiences here you'd think we would learn right Remember how I said I would never go back to eat here ever again Well this morning I did And I regret itLong story short We stood in line ordered paid $30 for two breakfast items and two iced soy lattes found a table and waited And waited And waited And waited As soon as I noticed a table of four who had come in significantly later than us being delivered food and enjoying their meal I was furious Our drinks were gone and we had been sitting there for almost 40 minutes My boyfriend went to the counter to ask them what was going on They didn't have our order Surprised I shouldn't have been Essence and I just weren't meant to be IT GETS BETTER  We asked for the food to go since we live 2 minutes away and we were sick of sitting there They brought out the food super fast which was a little concerning since our food hadn't been made yet right They were kind enough to load us up with some goodies but it didn't even matter because after our super short drive home we immediately opened our food from being super hungry and its was COLD Holy shit Give me a break.
3594,0,I've used Sparklean Laundry for the past two months for wash & fold service The detergent they use smells like wet rat so I had to bring them my own but they still use the in house detergent from time to time They also misplaced the dryer sheets that I had brought in When I questioned the staff about it they shrug it off and play pass the buck I'm a real Yelper with real friends & place real reviews Heads up on this business I'm done.
4649,0,"I ordered my food online and this is what happened when i went to go pick it upI must mention it was also a very slow night i saw 2 customers and about 7 staff membersWhen i arrived to this restaurant I was not greeted with a friendly hello or how are you i was greeted with :are you the online order"" I said yes and was pointed to my order which was sitting on the counter I looked inside and saw my hamburger and fries but only one order of fried pickles I told the women(dianna) at the register I had 2 orders of fried pickles and was quickly snapped back with ""no you didn't"" I said then can you explain to me how my order comes to $25 with a $6 order of fried pickles and a $8 burger she(dianna) pulled out the invoice waved it in my face and put it back behind the counter before i could even touch it or look at it when i said 8 and 6 only make 14 and that a paid for another order she rolled her eyes and told the cooks to make me another order then i checked my burger( i put very specific instructions that i only wanted baconlettuce and pickles no condiments or cheese) i open it up to find not only was it slathered in cheese but also mayo I told her this isn't what i ordered and had to ask her to remake it 3 times before she stopped staring at me and had it remade she then walked away no apology or anything i didn't see her again while i waited and extra 20 mins for my order Another waitress came over and was extremely sweet and double checked my food before letting me check it again she sat and talked to me while i waited and was very apologetic and i was impressed with how she handled me being a very upset customer her name was annie I also came to find out that dianna the women who was extremely rude to me was the assistant manager I am appalled at the customer service i received by this women dianna I have been in customer service for 7 years and i have never seen someone so unprofessional my suggestion to this location is to fire dianna and make annie a manager at least then you wouldn't get such awful reviews."
534,1,Had breakfast here again today and had the special it was very good and a really great deal I really love the fish special they have here on Fridays it is really awesome and the price is just as good This place has really nice ambiance to it Adriana the owner is really nice and always greets me with a smile when I come here  All the waitresses here have been really friendly and attentive the service is really top notch.
2302,1,The farmer salad the bread and then the pizza Who says you can't get great pizza outside of NY Great meal Worth a drive.
3614,0,"I am disappointed  I wanted to like this place  My husband and I decided to give this place a try  Big mistake  What a waste of a ""date night""  It was very busy so we decided to sit at the bar  Not a minute after we sat down one of the girls behind the bar broke a glass and shards flew in our direction  My husband was hit in the face and even pieces of glass were in his hair  What did this girl do  Nothing lifted her head and asked ""did I hit you"" my response was ""I think you can see glass all over his hair and in front of him""  Under her breath she said ""sorry"" and turned around to take care of other people  I asked someone else at the bar if this is the way they welcome their patrons because I might be missing something  Eventually one of the managers came and apologized and bought us a round of drinks  The sushi is not great is your typical load of mayonnaise to mask everything  There are better places for sushi."
2133,1,AmazingI ordered the Spinach Tortelloni and the ricotta filling was bursting at the seams drenched in herb-butter sauce Oh it was divineWe went here on a double-date and sat on the patio There was no dirt involved or flies as some of the reviews suggest In fact it was impeccably clean well-designed and relaxing We went on a Tuesday night so it was not very busyI am a fan of all Sam Fox's Restaurant Concepts and this one did not disappoint.
4898,0,"WARNING: This location is under new management Do not trust any reviews older than 2 months This used to be one of my wife's and my top 3 favorite restaurants During the last several months we were noticing cost cutting measures being implemented such as the olive oil jars being removed from the tables and only portioned out by the staff (I can't stand referring to them as servers it feels degrading) But the food was always top notch Then suddenly about 2 months ago the management was replaced because apparently the cost cutting measures weren't enough Now this is a completely different experience Honestly if I had never eaten here before the food would be good if it was a $14 per person restaurant But compared to what it used to be and the fact that if you order an appetizer it's at least $25 per person ""never again"" I'll start with the calamari appetizer Once lightly breaded and perfectly tender it is now over done bland and artless The previously chunky mouth watering marinara dipping sauce was watered down and soupy My personal favorite Ricardo sauce used to have loads of fresh sliced peppers and tang now it tasted only of melted butter with a couple of diced veggies on top and left a film in my mouth My wife's salad tasted the same as always but my sausage lentil soup was suddenly mealy and lacked the flavor I used to crave We ordered the sirloin marsala and while the taste was similar the sauce was thin and my steak was noticeably tougher Also they only had one vegetable selection instead of two or three like always If you didn't like broccoli that night you were out of luck In short while decent if it was a cheap Italian dinner on the go the recent cost-cutting changes to the menu render this $25 per person restaurant a no fly zone."
4162,0,Bah  Below is my outdated review  I hate Danny's Do not come here  I got my oil changed and they forgot to put a plate back on the bottom of my car  I found out when I brought my car into the dealer for a repair  They were like uh do you know part of your car is missing  my friend also had a bad experience  Over $200 for a crappy detail job  Don't botherWhat to say about Danny's    It's a full service joint  You can have your car washed oil changed tank filled all while relaxing in an air conditioned sitting area  The prices are on the high side and it can be quite busy    I'm still looking for a cheap place to get my car washed but I do bring my car to Danny's for oil changes.
3224,0,Ok so my reference point is Little Tokyo in LA  I ordered an ahi salad and a Soporo  Trying to do the healthy thing  The salad simply didn't have flavor and was over priced at $15 and my beer was $10  But I can live with thismaybe it costs more to transport to the AZ  Like whatever im a grown upWhat killed me though was the service  My salad was forgottenbut ok it happensbut it still arrived before my beer Which I had to ask about      Sothe waitress finally checks on me then I ask her for the checkto get things going I just hand her my credit card  And sigh you can guess the rest  After 15 min  i have to walk up to the register to settle RrrrrrrrrrrrPositives is that this place is a magnet for cute girls which at least can take your mind to a happy place while waiting in purgatory Also the manager followed up quicklySo next conference I will stick with the hotel restaurants which have been good thus far and fair prices.
3665,0,Worst green curry I have ever had The chicken and vegetables in the curry were good and fresh but the actual curry aSauce was awful It said it was made with coconut milk but I'm thinking more like coconut water or maybe just plain water It was runny and flavorless But the spring roll that came with the lunch was good.
2343,1,Fresh and amazingly good food  It is a must stop.
4369,0,I went there thinking / hoping this place had some resemblance of its predecessor The Fish MarketBoy was I mistakenFirst there was nothing that resembled a typical lunch menuEverything on the  menu was $$ including the 1/2 sandwich and fries for 995 which I'm sorry I orderedThe sandwich was remarkably small with 1 small piece of lettuce slice of tomato and what looked liked a small scoop of tuna The bread looked like it may have been right out of a loaf of Roman Meal breadThe fries seemed like a normal small portionWhen served I recall how astonished I was at how small the entire combination was and how I knew I would be hungry afterward since I don't eat fries however the substitutions came at an extra chargeWhich meant I just got a tiny half sandwich for 10 bucks or a tiny sandwich with cole slaw for even more $This was a lunch experience that made me angry with each passing moment i sat there fuming primarily due to the lackluster portion the price and the mediocre service I really dont like to score a place one star but in this case if Bluewater has the stones to sell a small ordinary 1/2 sandwich for 10 bucks I feel the need to tell anyone interested how this place offers absolutely no value for the $$I will never go back to this place Once bitten twice shy as the saying goes.
1177,1,I have a huge sweet tooth but being a baker myself I'm always very picky about the desserts I choose I have to say Woobie's Cookies are definitely high on my favorite cookie list The cookies are consistently soft and fluffy with some really cool flavors I tried their Caramel Brulee Woobiedoodle last Saturday for the first time and I was surprised at how yummy rich the flavor was My favorite though is still the Cocoa Ganache These ladies have NAILED the art of ganache which is not an easy feat It's also good to know they use quality organic ingredients which is a HUGE plus for me since not only is it better for you but it really makes a difference in the taste It's cool to know I can find some really good quality stuff from this unique small business right here in downtown Phoenix.
3737,0,"First off let me tell you that my husband and I have been making this a regular stop about 800 times a month When we have to go to a couple stores and we we stop there first to have a meal because it is across the street  One I had worked till 3:30am and had not woken till about 10:30 am and When my husband said we had to go to a couple stores I suggested a stop for something to eat at what had been one of my favorite places Good food mostly nice service friendly atmosphere and seemingly clean My husband always orders for me so he asked what I wanted I told him I would like coffee with my food because I was cold  then I might have something after eating I ate my taco's my husband ate his breakfast  When the second person came around he asked if he could get us anything else I asked for a rum and coke he said something to the effect of he wasn't serving anymore drinks that day We actually thought he was joking then he brought us the bill I asked him again for a drink and he said I looked drunk Tired maybe but hadn't had anything to drink that day I paid my check and told him that we would not be back He said "" who cares"" He heard my husband order coffee from the other barmaid with my meal My husband always orders for me Point is that although they stay busy most times they just lost over $200+ a month because of his behavior Maybe they should think to ask the person they took over for what the story was Did my shopping and now I will go spend my money somewhere else."

3493,0,Well we got our clothes back - I suppose that is deserving of at least one star And they were reasonably pressed and looked acceptable Unfortunately whoever staples those numbered pieces of paper through the button holes of shirts is a bit overzealous on his or her stapling Of the 10 shirts left 4 had multiple staples actually stapled through the shirt fabric I've actually never had this happen anywhere else in all the years I've been using cleaners This might not seem like much of a deal until you go to pull the paper off and actually rip the shirt in the process Stick to your iron and water or find another cleaner that pays more attention to detail.
3766,0,Oh my Restaurant week 2011   This meal was a disaster Terrible servicetotally non existent  service No beverages offered and we had to ask for them  There was a 25 minute wait for a reserved table whilst 10 empty tables needed to be cleared Food incredibly lacking in flavor  Lobster was NOT servedit was langoustine  Steaks mediochre to be kind  Excessively salty saladcould not eat it Pecan pie smothered in caramel sauce Honestly good pie ruined  ONE WAITER HUMMED LOUDLY FOR THE ENTIRE EVENING He wasn't part of the entertainment Will never waste money there again So many great restaurants in townTHIS IS NOT ONE OF THEM.

358,1,"With the closure of one of my favorite nearby sub joints - Port of Subs on Scottsdale - I find myself pleasantly surprised to find another great sub joint pop up nearby This one perhaps even better than my old favoriteSee I don't like to eat at sub joints that get their meats shipped in boxes pre-sliced who knows when Port of Subs was one of the few that cut the meat when you ordered I'll miss that but Silver Mine is close They slice the meat fresh all day as part of the shifts That means it's still very fresh The quality of their meats and bread is great as well Their bread is especially good The restaurant is clean - immaculate even The employees are all really nice dudes So friendly I doubt they're even from here They must be from the Midwest This place would probably deserve four stars like any other good sub joint should but what sets this place apart is that they deliver until 3am That's right - not only does this place deliver sandwiches they're open until 3 mother-frenchin a-to the-m Their brownies are 430 calories and they worth - they worth hard They carry a great selection of chips and bev and since they are relatively new on the scene - they seem to be constantly tweaking the business here and there Their menus get revised every time I order from them They give away scratch cards that usually give you a free delivery or a free small side item or drink or something I have yet to win a car or my own franchise but they popped up all over town at some point recently If I did win my own sub shop I'd change the tag line to ""You can't beat our meat"" because that's what the people would wantSeriously these guys are cool and the food is good."

3609,0,delta airlines is one of the worst airlines out there my flight out of PVD was delayed sat on the runway for a good 20mins when we arrived in ATL they forced all of the passengers to do planeside valet bc the overhead bins were smaller than normal so i had to wait another 20mins for my luggage these series of events caused me to miss my connecting flight to PHX none of the delta representatives and managers cared there were no more flights out to PHX that night and they were not willing to provide hotel accomodations and/or a meal voucher so i was stuck in the ATL airport overnight seriously one of the worst experiences EVER and i fly a lot 0* if i could.
4745,0,NO WAY  Went there in plenty of time of before Groupon expiration date and got a story that they are booked until expiration  They would not honor for the Groupon value after that date even though it was THEIR fault that we couldn't get in  No I will not spend the lesser amount coming back to Salt Cellar  They will get NO money from me  Groupon will refund my payment  Rude rude manager  No desire to eat there.

1137,0,I went to this business many years ago and would not go any where else  This time I can't even get through the door  First I called several times leaving messages that were not returned until some called and left me a half-hearted message saying I am just calling in case some else didn't call you  Knowing their past reputation I kept trying until I got someone on the phone and made an appt  They called and confirmed my appt for today  We showed up with our pet on time for our appt and waited on hour outside and no one showed  They obviously do not need any new business or they would honor people's time  My husband has a job as I do I and we do have the time to wait  We called their number there was no message that there had been an emergency.

233,0,If I could give no stars I would--went here last December for a friend's birthday  While sitting in the bar a cockroach climbed up the wall behind her  I alerted the waiter who ran in back and disappeared for at least 5 minutes  In the meantime another patron still wearing a full suit from his work day had to kill the cockroach  Reported it to the state who went out and determined they should get rated a gold star  Disgusting I have not and will not return If there are cockroaches in December just imagine how many there are in the July heat.

2366,1,Fajitas is by far the best place forfajitas  The homemade tortillas are some of the best in the City  I am not sure if any of the other mexican food is even any good here because I have been going here for years and only order the Cadillac and Chicken combo platter of fajitas  The salsa is very good if you like fresh tasting salsa that is very runny  The guac isn't always very good but the meat and toppings go well with the dish  The atmosphere is supper casual and the bar sits in the middle which isnt very large but this place gets super busy in the evening and there is alot of energy in the place  I have been going here for years and I cant think of a single time the service was not fast and great  I highly recommend trying it out if you are in the area.

251,0,Our flight out of San Francisco was delayed due to maintenance issues We were flying to Phoenix connecting to a flight to Puerto Vallarta The delay would have caused us to miss the connection At first US Air suggested that we skip the first day (keep in mind this is a prepaid vacation) They then rerouted us to fly out of San Jose International I informed the rep that my ride will not be able to drop us off at San Jose and I'd have to park there Also the fact that we'd be flying back to San Francisco and I'd have to take a cab to pick up my car from San Jose I was told that it would not be a problem and that I should file a claim once back from vacation I filed a claim and all they can do is to apologize for the inconvenience and nothing else Very disappointingAirport and flight crews were great.

1365,0,Usually I would give this place 5 stars but tonight I was pretty disappointed with the service I have gone on Friday nights when it is super busy and I still get 5 star service Me and my friend went tonight July 15 2013 because she wanted to use her coupon for a free birthday bowl when we arrived we waited at the front for the hostess to seat us for 10 mins then my friend just grabbed two bowls and napkins herself then we sat ourselves at a table usually this isn't a big deal but the fact that we waited for 10 mins is ridiculous because it wasn't busy you would think on a night that it was slow it would have been a good night to go but i guess we were wrong then when we tried to use my friends free bowl coupon the server told us that it had already been used even though she showed the server that she just got a email reminder that she needed to use the coupon before it expired on the 26th I understand when you put a code in and it doesn't work but the fact that the server seemed to get a little rude with us was uncalled for we weren't being rude to her we were just curious to why it wasn't working and the fact that there was no onsite manager there was stupid i just wanted to bring it to someones attention that the hostess was nowhere to be found when we tried to get a table and i'm sorry if you don't want to do your job then why are you working there when there are plenty of people out there that would be able to do you job with a smile on your face I just have to say i'm really disappointed with the crew that was there tonight it seemed like there were problems all night while we were there especially with the hostess very unorganized so if your trying to go there on a Monday night because it's not that busy I would say don't because you will get better service on the weekends I will not be going back there anytime soon.

1019,1,The rating is because of the gluten-free crust Anyone who is gluten-free knows pizza is tough to come by This is my third shot at a gf crust and it's a ton better than the others Thin fairly crispy (not easily done gf) and good I got the napoli (tomatoes and basil) and they have a bunch of other specialty pies Very casual and they do slices A definite pizza stop downtown.

2149,1,When my sister asked me to buy some winter dresses for my nieces I inwardly groaned because: 1 These are items that are best bought in person rather than online 2 What do I know about children's clothing I don't have kids so I don't know the best places to go Off to search on Yelp and I found Love Child Resale close to where I live The store is small but they pack in a lot of clothing and toys in it all very reasonably priced After searching online and in various other stores I found that for some reason it's hard to find winter dresses in the winter Luckily they had the perfect dress in my niece's favorite color at a rock bottom price I picked up a long sleeved Ralph Lauren dress in very good condition (No tears or stains only slight wear from washing) a dress that is $45 new for just $550 used hereItems were easy to browse through as everything is nicely separated by size If I need to buy kid's clothes again this is a good place to go.
3391,0,I originally posted a negative review on this restaurant back in November and the manager immediately contacted me and said steps were being taken to improve the sanitation issues I had mentioned  Changes were noticed and I have been a regular customer since although a visit on Saturday (Apr 28th) will change that again  As I was eating I witnessed an employee wiping tables with a rag  Someone behind the counter yelled at him to clean up a mess on the floor so he bent down and wiped up the floor with the same rag  Then he proceeded to wipe off all the used trays with that same rag and put them back into circulation to be used by the next customers  I got up to leave and said something to the girl behind the counter about it and she just ignored me   So I will be ignoring this restaurant from now on.
3558,0,I've been here 6 or 7 times and at first fell in love with their carne asada burrito This love was short lived as every time I take my first bite the wrap completely apart due to the pico sauce water Here's where the 1 star comes in Service leaves a LOTTT to be desired EVERY time I've ordered the same thing and every time it takes 1/2 hour on average for the burrito to reach my table There are 2 people eating inside the restaurant and 1 in the patio area - it shouldn't take this long My coworker always gets a bean burrito with no cheese and EVERY time they've messed up the order and had to re-make it leaving us eating at different times 3 weeks ago we were eating here and the Sheriff's department shut it down because of illegal immigration Took 2 weeks for them to open up shop again Unfortunately this has had a worse effect on the service (at least it seems as though this is the case) because not only did my burrito come out 1/2 hour later but as I finally got up the courage to complain the manager gave us all kinds of excuses and no apologies I guess I'd still eat their food if it was take out but other than that I don't think I'll be coming back to America's taco shop anymore Good Luck guys.
3310,0,Awe I hate writing bad reviews I know they hurt :(I am writing because I REALLY wanted to like this place I have heard good things from a good friend of mineWent here on a date with my lovely girlfriend for a girls night out Light sushi fare and cocktails Ordered the Porn Star martini love the name hated the drink was there any vodka in it NO it was watermelon juiceOur waitress left us hanging high and dry when it came to ordering food and new cocktailsShe seemed off of her meds The runner brought us the wrong food TWO times and took 45 minutes for the right ones to be servedAgain I am sorry for the bummer review but I wont be returning for slow service or bad food and cocktails.
1447,1,Absolutely delicious food the employees are SO friendly & welcoming true genuine mediterranean meals The atmosphere is wonderful as well Service is consistently great I would definitely recommend Princess to anyone.
536,1,Excellent lentils and brown rice :) Highly recommended.
4221,0,"After several hundred professional massages over the past 20 years I encountered today a first -- a massage therapist who explained that she could not do a massage involving any but mild pressure using her hands It was an issue of ""protecting the thumbs"" When I told her I didn't like forearms and elbows she explained that she'd never worked without using her forearms (and I assume her elbows too) After just five minutes when I asked for more pressure she suggested we stop the massage -- that she wasn't the ""therapist for [me]"" She was right What are they teaching these people these days and why doesn't an excellent outfit like LifeTime Fitness insist on better skills among its massage staff I won't offer her name but if considering a massage at this establishment I suggest Casie as the only therapist here worth the money."
1376,1,Love love love this mall  It has everything.
3468,0,Yuck yuck yuck I can't believe this place has good reviews  It must be because a majority of the reviews are written by people who stop here after a night out of drinking  The other night I was craving some Mexican food and instead of going to the other Mexican joint that's less than a block away I decided to try Amados  Big mistake huge  Sure it's open 24 hours but so is the competitor around the corner and they offer tasty foodMy chicken chimichanga plate was gross on a buncha levels  First off it's obvious the oil hadn't been changed in a while because I could SMELL the deep-fried tortilla and not in a good way  After a test bite or two I decided I'd just eat the chicken inside but it was SOOO SALTY that I literally ended up throwing most of it out  I have never ever done that to a chimichanga before  :(  Finally the beans and rice had almost no flavor  I don't even know how that's possible rice sure  Beans tho  Because of the 4 stars I was thinking I should give it another try but honestly just can't stomach the idea of it  Won't see ya there.
4139,0,Terrible service & charged me for ceramic brakes but only gave me lower-quality semi-metallic brakes After I went to another mechanic to discover the problem Fletchers still wouldn't fix the problem.
1441,1,The owner is what makes this place POPPING Down to earth people and no bs I'm from California and I'm very meticulant on the type of pho I go to This is by far THEE BEAT OR EVEN BETTER THEN CALIFORNIA Try this out  The only negatives is probably that it gets busy at nightthey probably need to make it bigger.
2849,1,Couldn't believe the water was cool on a 100somethin degree day So much fun except for the almost hitting the low-lying branches when the rapid water would drive us towards the edge Will be going back here soon.
1489,1,I am so happy this location opened up  It's so close to home and honestly better than any other pizza place I have ever been too  The serious slices are as big as a new born baby and taste like GOD himself kneaded the dough  I would recommend this place to any and everyone I meet.
3146,0,My husband would give My Big Fat Greek 0 stars but I'm going to give it 2 We actually used to go to the location in Scottsdale and we've also been to this location many times We always enjoyed our meals thereWe didn't have it tonight but I especially like the Bruschetta It's a huge portion I like the grilled foccacia and all that tops it including tomatoes basil hummus and sweet balsamic reduction It's served around a nice marinara sauce that is also topped with a bunch of junk This is the highlightOn this trip I got a large Greek Salad I like the creamy type greek dressing it's atypical for Greek salad but I'm into it I also like the warm pita that surround the large bowl I get a little side of jalepeno cilantro hummus and dip away My husband got chicken and lamb souvlaki tonight The wooden skewer broke into his lamb so he had to do surgery to remove it The lamb had gristle the chicken was under seasoned The side vegetables were undercooked and cold and the rice was tepid When the manager came by asking how everything was my husband gave him the FYI- and he was kind and ordered us a dessert We declined My husband was turned off by the chipped plate of his appetizer salad a cricket crawling along the ground (in all fairness the door to the patio was open) and the light above our table flickering on and off We had a savvy dining coupon for buy one entree get one free and our bill still came to $30 We had to order two drinks to get the coupon My husband got a Sprite and I asked for a hot decaf tea They said they had chamomile but then came back to tell me that they're out of all decaf teas so I got an apple juice I didn't drinkThe $30 meal included:Lamb and Chicken Souvlaki meal with side Greek SaladLarge Greek Salad with ramekin of hummusSpriteApple JuiceWe thought it was pricey for a buy one get one deal The drinks were $3 a piece so really we just got $3 off of my salad because if it weren't for the coupon we wouldn't have ordered drinksOur waitress was very niceEdited: I had to drop it to one star My husband had serious stomach issues the whole night.
1855,1,When I am in this part of town and want amazing food Awesome service and friendly faces CK's is where I want to go Sad to say that Tommy Pierucki is no longer there and has moved on to bigger and better things but he will always be credited with spreading the word to me and others about this amazing restaurant.
2306,1,I wish these were on every corner like Starbucks This place pretty much takes the cake over Starbucks Their coffee isn't overwhelming and they have my favorite drink everrrrrrr  which is the Iced tropical tea latte It's absolutely delicious Yum I urge everyone to try that drink.
2158,1,Dear Egg Rolls how I do love you here at Saigon Kitchen You are delicate flavorful and SUPER HOT It's hard for me to wait when you come out of the kitchen but I MUST because you burn the crap out of my mouth otherwise :) Love wrapping you up in a leaf of lettuce and mint leaves Love dipping you in the wonderful sauce You complete meWe also enjoyed the vegetarian pho today and my son had the filet mignon beef stew The meat in the stew was so tender it just fell apart It was perfectly delish The pho is what you make it to be Add the fixings and make it what you want it to be and stop complaining about it being bland It's SUPPOSED TO BE.
1669,1,There is no question that Yelp did me a massive favor in finding Miguel Flores My husband had decided it was time to take the plunge and have our AC replaced Flores AC was not the first or last company we called but between crazy sales tactics tirades about competitors no shows etc he is the one we chose When I originally called it was a Saturday morning and Miguel said he could be at my house in a couple of hours He showed up on time and astonishingly my husband really liked him Everything was very straight forward We told him what we wanted he explained what he would do and said he would email over a quote That quote was to us later that day with the exact model number information which allowed us to research it as much as we wanted I was not at home for the install but a glowing report came back from my husband He showed up as he said he would with his crew which is a family affair My husband stressed the word professional to me several times in describing their work and the care they took of our house He spoke of the efficiency of which they worked together how one would say the tool needed and where it was and the other went directly there to get it He mentioned they took care to cover all the areas they worked in Miguel mentioned that if we called around we would find his price to be the best We never did get pricing on the same model so I couldn't say it for sure but we feel that we paid the right amount to the right company.
4048,0,The food tasted fine but no veggies cheap cheap cheap with the rice No sauces with dishes to put on that bland rice The dinner portions were smaller than a kids meal at pei Wei We ordered the 4 course and both left hungry I said something and the waiter agreed it was a rip off but nothing happened I even left the promo behind for a free appetizer next time I was fuming at the price and skimpy portions so I called and talked ton a manger who invalidated the complaint and did not seem to care So the ne star is for those cutting back portions but wanting to pay $20 a person for kids meals.
859,1,No signage at all A bit pricey CASH only Limited hours horrible parking no indoor seating and competition for shaded seating on the half-dozen picnic tables of the back patio in this residential neighborhood Expect the line to be out the door and you are probably going to have to wait a minute to get your lunch because this is the best damn hole-in-the-wall Mexican joint in the valley If you have a tourist and want to really give them the Barrio Burrito experience this is it Everything is well worn-in and the look of things might scare off the meek gringo But it is exceptionally clean and the staff are friendly The Chimichanga shouldn't be eaten any further than 20' from the front door if you don't have time to eat it there: take another look at your life's priorities or order something else I've had the amazing Red Chili Beef almost every visit but last time had the Rice & Bean Chimi which may be a new veg fav The beef tacos are those amazingly greazy corn shells that may or may not be totally deep-fried order extra hot sauce and don't ask silly questions Rice & refried beans are just as they should be and even make a tostada delicious They sell bags of fresh tortilla & chips but I've never seen nachos on the menu Everything they do have on the menu though is best-in-class assuming you like this class If it's the middle of the week like between 11 - 4 I've got a $20 bill and a hankering for Mexican Al Fresco - Rito's Who's down.
4807,0,Horrible service both trash cans were over flowing with garbage on the floor everywhere The stocking areas were a disaster and no one was bothering to clean anything even though there were no other costumers to attend to before and after our visit Pure laziness Both of us who ate there got sick and are still recovering 16 hours later I will never eat at that location again and probably never at another Burger King restaurant.
4201,0,I go to Paradise Bakery fairly regularly in Surprise and while it's not perfect the Chicken Walnut Salad sandwich and the chicken with wild rice soup call my name from time to time and I was taught to always come when I'm called  I was heading out to the Wigwam today and stopped in at this Paradise Bakery location for a bite  Lunch starts at 11 I stood right in front of the sandwich station watching a worker still making omelets and purposely said nothing wondering when or if she would ever look up at me  I do this from time to time to test the service and this PB failed I knew she knew I was there but she made a point not to make eye contact with me until my friend came over from the bakery side after ordering her smoothie to ask me what the hold up was I then said very loudly that I was still waiting for someone to take my sandwich order It was 11:15 The omelet worker never did look at me when she asked someone to come over and take my order  I placed my order for my sandwich and then got my soup I had to wait for an employee to wander over to the cash register and then realize she didn't have a cash drawer in order to pay More meadering employees before the cash drawer came  I didn't get my sandwich until 11:30 I ordered a 1/2 chicken walnut salad sandwich Nothing specialno changes to it It took 15 minutes to get it and that would be 30 minutes after changing to lunch That's unacceptable I will skip this location in the future not just because of the slow change-over to lunch on a slow day but because the employees were just indifferent and slow and this is often indicative of a poor management team I can spend my money at better places.
4811,0,The respect from the workers there was flat garbage I got a text saying you can get a buy one get one free smoothie I go in there and ask them about the buy one get one free and the cashier denies it exists I have the text and it came from Jamba Juice He had NO respect towards me Later he completely ignored me I used to come to this Jamba Juice a lot and now I'm not If they get nicer staff that have better attitudes then I will consider coming back But until then i will never come back If I can give this place a negative 10000000 stars I would Customers would be happier if Jamba Juice on Thunderbird Road got new staff This is pitiful.
185,1,Best airport food in the country I'm a cowboy/rancher and I approve of this beef Not allowed to have steak knives in the airport sooo They drop really tender beef on your plate And they cook It to perfection And in picky when it comes to how my meat is cooked So to speak Get the testosterone saladEat beef.
3397,0,I'm not a Starbucks regular but I was with friends who wanted to go here for breakfast To be fair I've never once had a good experience at any Starbucks and this was no exception To me Starbucks is always crowded noisy and has slow and rude service Overall too stressful for me if I want coffee I want a relaxing experienceOn this trip I ordered a breakfast sandwich whichever one was featured in all the pictures on the menus I asked for it to have turkey bacon instead of regular bacon This totally confused the barista who for some reason thought I wanted two sandwiches We got our stuff to go and getting outside was like a blessing as it was so much quieter outside  I opened my package and found a completely different sandwich from what I ordered My friends then explained that Starbucks doesn't customize sandwiches for customers and what I got was a sandwich called the turkey bacon I have no clue why the barista couldn't have explained that to me instead of just giving me the wrong thing there are no signs indicating this and as a non-regular I wouldn't have known My friends couldn't explain it to me at the time of ordering because the store was so noisy and loud they would have had to scream at me The sandwich I received was bland and I only ate a small part of it before throwing it out The only other item I got was from the cold case so they couldn't screw that up because I picked it myself But yeah apparently ordering one item is too difficult and they will screw it up.
2401,1,Did a fantastic job putting in new deadbolts and re-keying all the locks in my new home They even made different levels of security (house and outdoor gates) just like we requested Jeff made sure all the doors were functioning properly and he is prideful of his work What more could you ask for This a a great local company that I highly recommend.
1132,1,We love this location Samantha is a great serverShe's fast friendly and always is smiling no matter how busy it isWe usually get a bottle of wine and 2 slices Always excellent.
2726,1,The Poisoned Pen has been a local favorite for quite a long time as the last time I was actually in the store was in the '90s to get a book signed by Sue Grafton  I went here again recently to browse their selections and was happy to see that despite the invention of electronic books and media they are still here to please those that prefer turning paper pages to scrolling on a LCD screen  There is a wide selection of books to choose from including some very charming children's books in addition to their extensive mystery collections.
2832,0,Ordered flatiron steak first time charred to a crisp  Sent back came back raw in the center.
934,1,The cheese steak with sauce & onions is almost as good as the chicken salad which rocks.
2333,1,This is a great coffee house and as the central PHX area starts to gentrify this place will certainly be one of the go to spots to meet up and chill out  In the same space as the MonOrchid gallery you can't beat it for chill atmosphere  Coffee  Amazingly well-done  New drink for me: espresso-spritzeryes a fresh pour of espresso with club soda and a wee bit of agave  Jump-start and refresh all in the same glass.
3212,0,Greasy  Wet  soagy  They were out of chicken so i got a mixed of what ever they had left.
458,1,I love this place so much that it's all I often think about since I moved to the bay area 4 years ago  Enough saidIf I ever move back to Arizona again it's because of Papago Brewing.
4375,0,"Simply awful  We had heard a few people rave about this place and now I wonder if they were dropped as a baby or how they got this brain damage  The ""cheese"" is this awful petroleum grease product with yellow color  That was the worst of it but nothing was good at all  And crazy price to boot."
2134,0,this is such a long miserable story all i can say is pick another airline.
834,1,I've been going to Dr Miller for over 5 years  He is hands down the greatest dentist I have ever had  He is knowledgeable experienced technologically advanced and compassionate  Everybody who works in his office is very caring and friendly  I confidently and highly recommend Dr James Miller.
2354,1,I recently had a birthday happy hour/dinner at Nine-05 and was absolutely awed by how wonderful it was  The food was wonderful and the staff was outstanding - it was like they were hosting a birthday party for a family member  I enjoyed the different atmospheres this restaurant offers - it's perfect for both a sit-down dinner or an enjoyable night at their lively bar  I'll be a frequent visitorAnd when you go try the chai ice cream - delicious.
1151,1,I Love Love Love Oregano's  When I lived abroad I was terribly homesick for this place and to be honest the thought of living further than an hour's drive from Oregano's puts me into a panicThe food is Delicious and Generous and the prices are SUPER reasonable  The Alfredo the Dark with chicken is wonderful and my staple  I especially like the roasted poblano chile on top which oddly varies in degrees of hotness depending on the day  There was one time that I happily snarfed the pepper only to realize a minute later that my lips were ON FIRE  Like I had to ice them for the next 20 minutes  Still I take full responsibility for that silliness and recommend that everyone be Very Careful when eating those little guys  The salads are great the belinis are yummy- the staff is crazy friendly which would usually annoy the hell out of me but I find it oddly endearing  *sigh* I cannot wax poetic enough.
3941,0,WowI can't believe the rave reviews this joint gets I am FAR from impressedHot giardenara Is that what they called those pickled jalapenos they put on their sandwich NO WAY If you want authentic Italian Beef catch a flight to ORD and go to Portillo's or Gene and Jude'sThis place is sub-par at best If you're looking for something remotely close to Chicago Italian Beef in Arizona go to Tom's BBQ or Lobby's on Southern and McClintockThis place doesn't live up to the hype  Don't waste your time People who love it must not be from Chicago.
364,1,Great product friendly service convenient location huge selection of toppings that are displayed nicely This place is a winner My only little piece of constructive criticism is about the frequent customer card While it is awesome that they even offer it in the first place the maximum value of your free 10th item is only $300 It would be nice if the value was more near the amount most customers spend on a typical visit I find that my usual yogurt creation is in the $450-$5 range and I'm thinking that's actually even lower than most people I feel bad even bringing this up because anything for free is better than nothing for free but I think it is worth mentioning so some people aren't surprised when they fail to read the fine print before redeemingEdit: I just received a very nice message from someone at Zoyo letting me know that the $300 maximum is just there for their protection and so people don't take advantage of the promotion According to them everyone has received their 10th yogurt for free so far no matter what the weight has been Good to know I definitely appreciate the personal attention to my review (And no they didn't ask me to edit my review which is exactly why I am doing it).
335,1,"If your ever in the Peoria area and your craving something sweet stop by and get your fix These donuts are one of the best besides rainbow donuts on 51ave & Thomasit's heaven in your mouth they're so so good that I bought the two donut deal and I said to myself "" ok I'm gonna take one to my co- worker and on my way to wrk I just couldn't hold back so I ate my co-workers donut"" I know I knowI'm so so badbut it was so scrumptious Next time i'll get a dozenoh and try to pay cash because there's a 50 cent charge on debit or credit cardsso the only drawback is that they didn't tell me and I could've got another donut because i actually had cash on me that dayand I think you need to warn customers about their feesso it got me a little madbut it still gets 5 stars cause they're scrumptious : )."
4376,0,I called and the associate on the phone informed me that the Copper Door is OUT OF BUSINESSThanks a lot I just bought a $25 coupon to this establishment from Restaurantcom two days ago.
3723,0,We stopped by tonight a quarter to 9pm to get take out We've never been here before but have been wanting to try it out since we moved nearby We walked in and said hello to the teenage girl working behind the counter who did not respond She was counting change and turned to look at the clock on the wall My fiancée asked are you still open to which she gave him the finger to hold on and then said we close in 10 mins I told him lets go as she had already given us enough bad service As we walked out she put her purse on and turned the lights off before we even got into our car We won't be going back with that type or service Too bad management hasn't taught this teenage girl any customer service We will just continue to give other local Gilbert restaurants our loyal service.
784,1,My husband and I used a Groupon here for a wine tasting with my parents and we had a lot of fun We kicked back and tasted their yummy appetizers and wine while we played some games and had great conversation Our waiter was very kind (especially since it was a wine and cheese tastingand I have a cheese allergy) and accommodating We would definitely go back.
1996,1,Great taco shop Must get the tacos Been back a few times and haven't found anything that I wouldn't order again Great food fair prices.
4955,0,Worse food and service I've ever experienced Extremely rude people work hereThey were busy and a nasty waitress added drinks we never even ordered then was rude when we questioned her She removed the drinks then was a complete bitch I suggest you pay as you order for drinks or really check your bill before you pay.
58,1,All I have to say is get the California Club I live in the East Coast and I still crave for the sandwich I wish I had the chance to try other things on the menu The drive-thru concept is pretty neat but there was a bit of a wait Guess you can't rush perfection.
2588,0,Met with John for a consultation  Gave him a deposit for an original piece of art for a tattoo  He came back with a piece that was traced right off of Google  Not a piece of original art  Not my idea a true good art work  Glad I didn't have him tattoo me.
3940,0,I wish there was an option for ZERO stars  I came here one late night after a night out in Tempe  We went to Corleone's for two reasons - 1 we were hungry and 2 we needed to use the restroom badly  As one of the few open places in the area it seemed like a good plan  However after ordering our mediocre sandwiches which we waited over 15 minutes for we were told the bathroom is closed at night even for the employeesWhat kind of establishment is allowed to be open serving food and does not even have a restroomI think they should be shutdown.
2219,1,Great food great service only downside is a long wait sometimes but the food is worth the wait For a small mom and pop place the cooks  and the waitresses sure keep things moving so when you drive by and you see a line outside do not worry they have free coffee and that makes the wait not to unberable.
508,1,I've been to this adorable coffee shop probably 4-5 times now The owners are so friendly and cheerful and I love supporting a local business I'm a big fan of their chai tea and their chicken Caesar salad The baked items are delicious and everything is reasonably priced I'm craving another visit now just writing this.
1988,1,Another example of what a great spring training ballpark should be You cant tell that this ballpark is over 40 years old This ballpark has character along with great seating lots of parking and a team that should make some noise this season in the AL West Grab a beer and get comfortable in this gem of a ballpark.
3275,0,I told him no Swiss cheese and they still made it and they still made it with this was cheese I had to wait a second time I would recommend coming here they don't pay attention.
1172,1,OF COURSE five stars for the Phoenix Suns I'm psyched I can Yelp about them Born and raised in Arizona I was taught to support the suns from a young age I always had fun going to the games when I was young and I still do Going to a game is great way to have fun and I guarantee the suns put on a great game weather they win or lose Obviously I'm disappointed about our recent loss but they are still an awesome team The games as I mentioned are really really fun and the ticket costs are not to jacked up As far as Arizona goes The Phoenix Suns are definitely the best team in the state hands down.
857,1,I went to see Dr Garza for a simple checkup It turns out he was able to spot problems under some old silver fillings and was able to clear out the decay and replace with new white fillings I don't know how all my other exams and the dentists reviewing my X-rays could have missed it  Dr Garza spotted the damage and took care of it right away without the need for another appointmentDr Garza is true professional who cares enough about his clients to give the best care possible I am definitely recommending him to all my friends and family.
3027,1,I have to give this place 5-stars The cheese plates are small and everything is a bit pricey but I feel it's well worth it Windows surround the building to the east and north You can gaze out on Central Avenue and watch passers-by cars and the light rail The area suggests Phoenix is coming of age into a more distinctive urban area rather than its notorious sprawling suburban-esque cityscape It's in a gentrifying neighborhood that's quickly becoming a more artistic upscale part of town They have a lengthy wine and cheese list the latter offering suggested wine pairings (if you're embarrassed to ask the server) However some pairings not suggested may surprise you The last time I went I was a bit disappointed that my favorite wine they sell (Duck Pond) is only available by the bottle The cheeses are good though I've learned from experience to try a small taste of some before taking a larger bite and I haven't heard of most of them before going here I enjoy the Nearly Naked Theatre company which performs at the neighboring Phoenix Art Museum and always stop in here for a bit of wine and cheese prior to showtime.
2841,1,My family has been going to Dr Fuller for probably 7+ years It's been very hard to find a good Optometrist with a good staff We used to switch every few years cause the doctor was always good but no personality and the staff was off and on Meaning sometimes good other times they couldn't even fix our glassesDr Fuller is very nice like to joke around with us and knows our family Always asking us how our family is It's not just business which helps bring some personality to the doctor Also he will spend the time to explain anything with our eyes His staff seems to turn over every few years but he seems to always hire people who are very friendly helpful and smile I have never had any problem with Dr Fuller or his staff If you are looking for a really good Optometrist then give him a try Also it doesn't hurt that his office is close by our house.
254,1,If you hate waiting one to three hours at the DMV only to deal with rude associates then come to Desert Title I've gone here twice in the past year and never had to wait more than ten minutes and the staff is very professional and quick.
1454,1,So happy Naked Pizza chose Goodyear I am reviewing the food and service not parking The Pizza was excellent the delivery service was super-fast The crust (Original) was unique and very tasty The sauce was very natural tasting The toppings tasted fresh and unfrozen To compare the price and style of this Pizza to Domino's Pizza Hut or any of the big guys is unfair The bottom line is this: If you don't care at all what you shove down your throat get Domino's or Papa Johns Yes they are cheaper but there is a reason Kraft Macaroni and Cheese which is hardly even real food is cheaper than a fresh wild-caught salmon for example The bottom line is this: If you want a tasty fast and best of all healthy pizza get Naked If you don't care about what you put in your body get the big guys and keep eating HFCS Sugar Salt and Fat Did you know some pizza places have more than your entire daily value of sodium in just 1 or 2 slices of their pizza Their pizza might be cheaper but paying for your heart attack or stroke will most certainly eat up any savings.
3985,0,Probably the WORST food I have ever paid for.
2422,1,I love this location It's clean well organized doesn't smell weird and they have a good selection of kids toys and clothes The prices are pretty reasonable on most things and they usually are well stocked.
2609,1,Glad to see them on the map after winning Cupcake Wars Their cupcakes rival if not beat Sprinkles Brown Velvet Peach-Berry Shortcake and Tomato Soup & Grilled Cheese (sounded weird) but that last one was on Cupcake Wars and it was surprisingly really good as well Not to mention their stuff is all organic (hence the brown velvet instead of red) Definitely get their cupcakes and you won't be disappointed Just try and keep yourself from going too many times Hasn't worked well for our family yet lol.
4999,0,Horrible the bartender kept blowing us off he was more concered about talking to other staff members then assisting paying customer food was gross stay away.
4037,0,I ordered a burrito from here and the sour cream was literally curddled into a cottage cheese looking substance I got a couple bites in before I saw it and I immediately almost vomitted along with everyone around me that saw it Never again will I dine there you don't even get the chance to make a mistake like that again in my book I did not get sick thank God but still gross.
2945,1,Stimmler and Sons Air Conditioning was actually an HONEST air conditioning service  Dealt with many companies over the years and I have never found one like this  They were on time knowledgeable and cost-efficient  The most painless experience I have had with an air conditioning company  I would highly recommend them  This is the only air conditioning company I will be using from now on.
4366,0,"1 star for service and attitudeThe food was delicious  but the staff was very hateful I am writing this review I don't remember the waitresses name but I do remember that she was short  hispanic  and she was pregnant at the time She was incredibly hatefulSo hateful and rude to me and my parents I do know why she did this is because I am transgendered I was wearing leggings and I was carrying a black polo purse So I thought that this happened because of how I was dressed and how I looked  but that really wasn't the caseI went back 2 weeks later and I dressed differently More ""manly"" (ha) Different waitresses  same great food  same hateful attitudes I will stress to everyone reading this to save your time and money and go to a different pizza hut or a different pizza joint to get better service."
3518,0,In 18 years of sushi eating Ra is 1 of 2 places I have ever sent something back  Review complete.
501,1,i discovered this place about 6 years ago by accident and with a brief period in witch i lived out of state i`ve been going there frequently and i love all the menu items but the bread and the sausages are by far the best item  that item has become a must for all the family bbq  yes they sell them raw by the box for $45 and man o man they are good so if u want to try some real Eastern European food try this place and you won`t be disappointed  Can`t wait for next time when i will get lunch from them.
2552,1,Our son gave us a gift card for my birthday after researching on Yelp and the card was waiting for us on arrival  Located in beautiful Old Scottsdale this wonderful gastropub is beautiful and trendy and the food is to die for  Our server Chris was amazing and recommended the Chainbreaker brew on draft since the Four Peaks Hef was no longer available and it was delish and we both had two  We started out with the bacon-fat heirloom popcorn which my wife didn't care for but I loved  Hey I'm a guy and there was crumbles of warm bacon all through it  Then we both split their famous chopped salad which Chris brought to the table unchopped and chopped right before our eyes  Honestly I got cold chills with the first bite  Hands down one of the best tastes ever in a salad with salmon tomato arugula couscous etc (recipe on Facebook) and delicious homemade Buttermilk ranch dressing--perfection and we could have eaten a whole one but wanted to save room for more delights to come  Chris recommended the scallops which I had already had my eye on so my wife ordered the buttermilk roasted chicken served over sweet corn-butter succotash with roasted Brussels sprouts  Moist and delicious  My scallops were wrapped in Tender Belly Hampshire bacon nestled in a bed of roasted corn grits and topped with wilted snow pea greens (yum) and drizzled with a cola gastrique  Tenderest and most tasty scallops ever  By the end of the night manager Owen stopped by to visit--he had been staring at our names for over a month on his bulletin board and he wanted  to put a face with our names  Chris joined us for the sit down and we had a wonderful conversation Wanting to try the peanut butter bread pudding Chris recommended the Guiness pudding jar instead which was a stout infused chocolate pot de creme over a chocolate shortbread cookie topped with Irish whiskey crema and two chocolate shortbread cookies on the side and served in an actual small jar with lid I threatened to take off Chris' hand when he reached to clear the plate with the remains of the last cookie still on it  Overall a perfect night with perfect food and service in a warm inviting atmosphere  It does NOT get any better than this  Thank you my son.
1367,1,Probably the BEST restaurant I have EVER been to in my LIFE The place is phenomenal You walk into a very classy atmosphere and everyone is dressed to the 9 We were having a company dinner here so we were escorted to a lovely private dining room with sliding glass doors to enter and red velvet curtains lining the room Who ever had the idea of Lobster Mashed Potatoes is brilliant I loved those chunks of lobster in my potatoes it was probably one of the best side dishes I've ever tried We also got sides of the Gorgonzola mac and cheese and the sauteed mushrooms amongst other things all which were amazing But the steak  it was probably the BEST steak I've had in my life Perfect cut perfectly cooked tender and juicy as ever truly the best filet I've ever ate Order the chocolate covered strawberries as a dessert because those are a must The staff - all very pleasant and polite Sue who helped coordinate my company dinner there was fabulous to work with She even worked with my hotel to coordinate car service for us Be prepared to empty your pockets but its worth every last penny.

4544,0,I cannot believe what I was served here I ordered the mini Chimis The chicken ones were ok but a little plain The beef ones on the other hand were freaking MOLDY I can't freaking believe it I was very upset It seems as though I am not going to get sick from this (its been about 10 hours since I ate there and I feel fine) The waiter was nice and comped us the meal.
500,0,The service here is not the problem nor is the the saturation of tv's (quite impressed with the fireplace screen) it's the bad food  How can you mess up nachos and pretzels They serve these appetizers with a bland cheese and the salsa is also bland  The calamari No comment at this point With all this bad food they also lack beers nothing more than your average domestics Maybe if the parking was better I would give you the second starDefinitely no baby making here :(.
613,1,This was my first time to Yogurt Jungle I was very impressed My wife and I went there to try it out it just opened two days ago What I liked the most about this place was being a self serve yogurt store they actually tell there prices (39 cents an ounce) I have been to other self serve yogurt stores that its becomes a surprise at the end how much your yogurt isThey had 10 different flavors: Original TartPomegranateStrawberryGreen TeaRaspberry ( no sugar)Orange SorbetVanillaChocolateNew York Cheesecake PistachioWith over 60 toppings including candy fresh fruit dry cereal all types of syrups and much more I would highly recommended Yogurt Jungle My wife and I both had yogurts with all the fixings with a ice cold fuji water ( $100) for about $ 800 and my wife still had yogurt left Very clean location kid friendly had a counter low enough for kids to see the toppings Over all great experience the owner even introduced himself and was very friendly Being a small business owner I am always trying to support local business owners that offer a great product with great customer service at a reasonable priceThanks Yogurt Jungle for the great first experience we will return.
2610,1,Hands down my favorite pizza place in AZ  If you are a pepperoni pizza person you HAVE to try Grimald's pepperoni and ricotta pizza it's amazing  I visit both locations in Scottsdale the one in Old Town and the one in DC Ranch  Old Town gets really busy around dinner time on the weekends and DC Ranch is a little easier to get seated on the weekend  Both are really good.
469,1,Stop in every once in a while food is always good Street tacos  Drinks are reasonable Typical dos style Great place to hang out with your friends if you don't want to mess up your place.
1662,1,Michal is fantastic Been dealing with her for years followed her all the way from Chandler Mall No pressure best deal the first time and genuinely cares about her customers If you come here ask for Michal you won't be disappointed.
3752,0,YuckI thought it was related to Cracker Barrel Cheese It's a cute country style store if you are looking for candy from the past and rockersbut do not go for foodThey do have a really good Sweet TeaSay no the dumpling and chicken I've never had it so I had to try but now I wish I didn't.
263,1,"OMG this food is amazing This is a hole in the wall place in Sunny Slope Staff is very very nice Everyone you pass will smile and say hello and welcome  Some reviews have said this place is dirty I did not find this place to be dirty It's in an aging structure and gets HIGH traffic Floor are clean and they are fairly new tile  This is a Mexican place and they do only place Mexican TV I say this because I know some people are bothered by this  I how ever came for the food Waiters all speak English very clearly I ordered the Torta Nortena Meat was tender with a lot of flavor Bread was soft and kept well with all the juice  This was amazing So frickin good I want to go back today My Mother in Law ordered a tostada ""american"" style just beans and cheese  The owner also brought her out on that is ""mexican"" style and gave it to her for free so she could try they difference  Very NICE Portions are more then enough to make you full and you will leave still wanting moreCost is suprisingly cheap for the portions and how wonderful the taste isMenu is full of original dishes of their own making and every item has personality  One of my new favorite places  I have to drive about 20 min to get there but well worth it."
2252,1,So why did it take me so long to visit this resort around the corner from me  Talk about romantic and beautiful grounds  The bar spills out onto a gorgeous courtyard complete with awesome mountain views and fabby fountain  Fantastic service very ZEN and prompt bartending  Their cocktails are mostly all unique and fun  Great wines by the glass & YUMMY appies  They have an amazing Happy Hour - i am sooo going back asap.
2513,1,this was my last stop on my Phoenix vinyl ventures It was actually supposed to be my 2nd stop but they close too early at 6pm so I got there too late the first time I was able to get here at 530 and felt bad since the lady stayed around till 615pm for me-----I could have spent at least another 45 mins here I didn't realize that they kept an Indie section up front so after spending most of my time finding just a few items in the regular section I found my section but right at closing time As I have pretty much most of what I want on UK vinyl I now mostly collect Japanese vinyl releases----this place had a pretty good stock of nice Japanese pressings of the stuff I like Pricing was on the higher side most of my Japanese scores were $20 and up They had some killer 7' vinyl like rare Cure singles but they were way over-pricedi ended up spending the most dough here even though my best finds were at Revolver.
1670,1,Chicken mole tacos crazy salsa bar HORCHATAI have been living in San Diego for three years and had never once had homemade horchata loaded with fresh strawberries and cantaloupe pecans and cinnamon But now I have and I'm not sure that I can go back to the soft-drinky stuff of various fill-in-the-blank-bertosThey could start a lucrative business just selling that horchata but the food is amazing as well My friends and I slid through the door about half an hour before closing and were immediately greeted with menus and chips We ordered then proceeded to raid the salsa bar It wasn't at its full glory at the end of the night but 'twas still extensive Honestly I'm kind of a ho when it comes to condiments so trust me when I say we looted that baby Hard I can't pick a favorite but I was particularly fond of the avocado-cilantro as well as the chipotle salsa Them tacos is the stuff of dreams Layered corn tortillas rich and steamy chicken mole fresh onions y cilantro For all of a few minutes I was in heaven And then I was in a food coma Two tacos don't sound like much but it is definitely a good amount of food Especially if you've been sucking the life out of your horchataService was fast and friendly the dining area was clean and pleasant and I am officially crowning La Condesa my favorite taco shop of all time Big words coming from a California girl I know but I wasn't even drunk when I went (FYI I got drunk after and it all stayed down) I will be back La Condesa Mark my words361 miles can't stop my love for you.
897,1,A hidden treasure up on Pinnacle Peak & Pima  The pizza is quite possibly the best in town  It is cooked to perfection with lots of cheese & ample toppings  If your not in the mood for pizza their sandwiches are excellent as well  Also the staff is always friendly  I'm not sure why Paul didn't like it  Everybody I've talked to loves the pizza & I've often heard comments like it's better than other pizza places in the area (like Rosati's & Barro's) which I have to agree.
2761,1,A Great evening on Portland's patio with friends enjoying the best burgers and wines ever Tonight was a Champion Burger w/parmesan fries - Awesome.
2237,1,Suki suki nowwww Time for some PhoCan you say delicious in Vietnamese  WHO CARES  This place has got the best soup in town and unlike its neighbor LoLo's Chicken and Waffles this is healthy stuff  I have ordered the Chicken Broccoli and Bok Choy Pho twice now and have no complaints  They bring out all the fixins too Bean sprouts basil leaves cilantro and lime mmm  Rice noodles chicken broccoli and Bok Choy are simmered in a mouthwatering broth sprinkled with herbs to boot  If you haven't gone yet you better put that fried chicken down and check yourself.
639,1,Always packed - Always great food Sometimes the service can be iffy but that is because they are so busy Once you get your order in the food comes out fast and it is amazing.
4574,0,Poor service from the cashier and the manager They ran out of ice I already paid for my meal and wanted to get ice with my drink The manager said they would not fill up the ice because they were too busy She refused to refund my money I had to get back to work and did not want to fight about a cup of ice The Burgers are over priced They have the worst fries I've tastedI called back to try to speak to a manager They said they could not help me.
1938,1,My favorite sandwich shop period.
1003,1,As alwaysFlemings was perfect  Go here in Scottsdale and La Jolla---always perfect  Best steak everand I know a chainbut seriously amaze :)  If there's a Flemings around--I never seek out another steak place because we have a great time always  Even saw TW and Wil Ferrel one night at La Jollahahaha ).
2616,1,Mike's is a great place for a Philly cheesesteak The owner is a nice guy we see & talk to him each time we go in I lived in Philly for a while and I've been looking for a place that could serve a Philly up the way I had it back then Mike's got it covered The prices are good and and he really works hard to make his customers happy The Philly is a good size and fills me up so much that I can barely touch the fries  I recently discovered their onion rings and added them to my list of cravings Then they've got some good ice cream to satisfy our sweet tooth I've lost track of the times that my husband has brought Mike's home Their Philly's do great as take out they don't get mushy after the car trip home (we're about 5 miles away) Enjoy.
4535,0,"One star because ""no stars"" is not an optionThis is the exact email I sent to the brewery after leaving this establishment about my ""experience"" which has yet to be acknowledged :Pretty disappointed by last night's experience Or lack there of We got to the brewery a few minutes before what I was told was our ""reservation"" time and just shortly after a party of 4 had gotten there I heard the host tell the party that since they did not have a ''reservation"" it would be about a 30-40 minute wait The party moved aside to discuss if they wanted to wait or not The host then ignored my husband and I for 5 minutes while she conversed with 3 other employees all who seemed to not have a care in the world When we finally got her attention she found our name on the ""reservation"" list and informed us it would still be at least 30/45 minutes before we could be sat Now longer than the group who walked in before us that didn't have a ""reservation"" We have no problem over looking minor service issuesespecially at a new place when dining out but when it comes at the expense of wasting our entire evening that's just inexcusable Why bother taking reservations Scratch that why email me and ask me if I'd like to have a reservation for your establishment if you have no intention of honoring it Sure you maybe thinking ""we were going to honor it just 45 minutes late"" Which means it would take me how long to get food and beer after arriving at this imaginary table Also 30/45 minutes Lame So I have yet to get a response Forget this small place with crap parking Go to Fate or Angels Trumpet or Sun Up or Phoenix Ale House or Sleepy Dog or Four Peaks or Gordon Biersch or hell drive the hour to Sedona or Pine and visit one of their many breweries All of them will be more than happy to provide you with wonderful beer & food with out a ""reservation"" Just don't bother here."
641,1,Me and my lady friend went here for dinner last night We were a little underdressed but no one seemed to mind We were promptly greeted and seated Even though this was our first time dinning here the waitstaff made us feel like we were regulars The food was amazing The fried calamari was cooked perfectly and paired with a great tasting spicy marinara The salads were average but good and the entrees really stood out I had the Veal Marsala which was off the charts After 35 years these guys know how to cook veal It was pounded very thin and melted in my mouth The lady had the salmon which was parmesean crusted and very good It was mild and wonderful The tiramisu for dessert was also great Next time though i will get the pasta as the were making it fresh in the restauraunt I have to give that a try The ambiance was great I don't think they have changed anything since it opened in 1974 It's not trendy or chic but it is classy and takes you back in time It does seem like it attracts an older generation but if more people try this food they will flock there in droves I can not wait to go back.
2648,1,I am a big sandwich fan These are delish The sesame bread is the best It has a light crust with the perfect give and soft interior Parking is horrible but it's worth it to find someplace to park My fiancé LOVED the roast beef and he is not a sandwich personThe decor is cute and the service is super friendly If you love sandwiches try it It's better than any chain I have tasted.
4481,0,Terrible That's all there is to it That and the incorrect information they're totally willing to hand out I called and asked if they did eyebrow threading was told that yes they did went in a couple hours later and was promptly told that they didn't do that there and maybe I should check at the mall So I decided to get them waxed anyway When I went to pay the woman told me the waxing was 8 dollars Then after running my card and handing me a receipt she told me about the 2 dollar charge for using a card Which was something that would have been nice to know before she ran the card in the first placeWould not go back or recommend.
140,1,Went here after a movie on a Saturday afternoon  Take your movie stub and you will get a free appetizer  I am not sure why we had not been here before  It is really nice inside and was packed  They bring you cornbread to start - were were not expecting that so had to re-evaluate what we were going to have  We had the trio appetizer which was huge so then we decided to split the steak burrito - they brought it out to us already split on separate plates - like that   Everything was delicious and we are now kicking ourselves as to why it has taken us 2 years to go here .
1302,1,I searched coffee and found this gem What a delightful little shop Fresh homemade chocolates fresh everything I was so pleased with everything The prices are more than reasonable The owners are present they actually work there Very pleasant folks I highly recommend Rayner's.
1188,1,There are stores here at which I never shop (eg Tiffany Nordstrom Neiman Marcus Burberry Louis Vuitton Prada) and those which make up a lot of what's in my closet (eg Ann Taylor LOFT H&M Charming Charlie Abercrombie & Fitch lucy Victoria's Secret etc) There's also Sephora Sunglass Hut and Coach Some restaurants include The Yard House (yum) and Grand Lux Cafe The food court has a Paradise Bakery Valet parking is available and there's a parking garage as well This is my favorite shopping spot in the Valley You can very easily stay here and lose your entire dayas well as the contents of your wallet.
1213,1,Best fast food restaurant  Great service  Fresh food  Love the grilled cheese with grilled and raw onions and minimal sauce  The fries are great when they are hot  Fresh brewed iced tea with fresh big chunks of lemon  Mmmm I could eat here everyday.
4682,0,"First off this review is coming from someone who has been (and current is) a Regus tenant for 3+ years in both San Francisco and Phoenix  We most likely will continue to be a tenant in San Francisco as our company enjoys the ease of transitioning into this kind of office and enjoys furnished office setup that Regus offers even though you're paying a premium price for those services  And trust me Regus will charge you for everything from the office phone (separate fees for the handset and actual phone line) internet access black/color copies scanning mandatory kitchen fees and garage parking (optional although fairly affordable here)  We initially locked into a year long lease and was at this Phoenix location for about two full years  I didn't really have any major problems with this Phoenix location until I took over the management of our company's billing system  When you initially sign the lease you have to commit to how many phone handsets and internet lines you want  You pay for these office features like it is an a la carte menu just like a restaurant  What I was not thrilled about is that we eventually had to downsize our operations from 2 people to 1 person at this Phoenix location during our initial lease and we were still forced to pay for two phone lines and two internet connections  Keep in mind that the monthly total for a phone line and an internet connection amounts to about $200/month (and that does not include the long distance usage fee you incur on your phone) so it is a fairly expensive feature  I figured that Regus would have been reasonable enough to help us out but it was stated in our original contract we are responsible for the fees so I guess they have a ""gotcha"" on that one  But when we accidentally forget to cancel our lease our lease got rolled over for another six months and we were still being charged internet/phone charges for two people when we obviously only have one person occupying the office  I feel Regus need to use some common sense and ensure that company's are only being charged for the amount of people that occupy the office especially when it comes to an automatic renewal  Sadly this location does not act on the side of the tenants who occupy their facilities  Talk about ensuring the client gets shaftedMy second major gripe about this location is with center manager  Valinda Evans  Since at the time our company in the US only had two employees and two offices we felt it was more productive to have two people in the same Regus office (in San Francisco)  Therefore we decided to leave the Phoenix office unoccupied with three months left on our lease  I understand that you have to abide to the terms of your lease but I referenced to Ms Evans of our unique situation and it wasn't until three weeks later after my two e-mail inquiries that I received a response  Three weeks is highly unacceptable when you have a situation where you are in a position to leave your Regus office unoccupied and notification is made to the center manager    I would have liked a little bit of flexibility and perhaps be able to transfer our Regus financial obligation to our SF office or pay an early termination fee  Anything reasonable would have been helpful but the only reasonable option I had was to ""take additional space and sign and new contract""  She also added that ""there is really nothing that I can do unless you take additional space in another location""   Wow so not helpful  I was not seeking to get out of our leasing obligation just to find a way to make it a little more convenient so we do not let an office sit dormant for three months which was such a waste  If you are considering this Regus space in downtown Phoenix I would highly recommend seeking other office options  Phoenix has plenty of real estate in downtown and it should not be too difficult to find a sufficient alternativeTip: Regus will not notify you prior to the termination of your signed lease If you fail to notify them for another extension or to leave all together they will automatically renew your lease for something like six months so beware that you have to notify them a certain amount of months prior to the termination of your lease."
4199,0,One of these just opened by my house and my husband and I were really excited to try it because everyone says such great things I was so disappointed I agree that the fries were limp and I'm a crispy fry lover The burger tasted good but I felt pretty ill shortly after eating it Not food poisoning ill - more like over-greased ill I don't really eat fast food so maybe that's it but I will not be returning.
434,1,Nestled behind most of the bustle from Scottsdale road just south of Camelback road a funky serene little spa has popped up to serve the skin and eye brows for the otherwise facially deprivedFull service facials eyebrows (as you might guess) massage and much more good prices great service all in a place that smells really good too.
4572,0,"Let's start with the positive: The food and drinks tasted greatWORST SERVICE I HAVE HAD IN A VERY LONG TIME We ordered three margaritas and two orders of tacos and the bartender charged us for six margaritas and four orders of tacos--plus he charged us for the beer of the guy next to us When I tried to get him to fix it he came back with the wrong amount a second time (still over charging us) and the the third time he just ran my credit card without allowing me to see the itemized bill I was mortified and he extremely rudeAlso the people next to me gave their credit card and when they attempted to get it back they were told by this same bartender that they never gave him their card They insisted for thirty minutes and which point he said to them"" NO ONE HERE HAS YOUR CREDIT CARD YOU HAVE SAID THAT YOU GAVE IT TO SEVERAL PEOPLE AND YOU DIDN'T"" When another bartender gave them back the card a few minutes later there was no apologyZ Tejas is right across the street The food is delicious and the bartenders are phenomenal I was just there and without my even saying anything when the food took over twenty minutes to come out they comped our entire meal."
2537,1,First time today  What was I thinking and why did I wait so long to head down here  Seriously $1699 (with coupon) for a hand wash of SUV glass cleaned mats cleaned vacuum and tire dressing  It was busy hot and the wait was long but totally worth it  I usually wash and detail my vehicles myself but just couldn't get to it this weekend  Anytime I can't wash my own vehicles I'm bringing them to Los Olivos  And the employees are so nicebonus.

4978,0,My wife and I ate here last night and were enthusiastic upon entering the restaurant after hearing and reading all the hype about this chain  But what a major disappointment  We ordered a large pizza with sausage and mushrooms  Grimaldi's is very proud of their pies with a $1600 sticker price on a basic large cheese  Toppings are $200 each  So with $2000 invested in the pie we were hoping for a really good taste  We like our pizza a little extra crispy and ordered it that way but it came out chewy like a piece of jerky  Upon inspection - I pulled the cheese and topping layer off the crust - we saw a gummy crust that looked like a glazed donut A total turn-off  Also the sauce was tasteless and the cook skimped on the toppings  I've eaten a gazillion pizzas in my day and this pie gets a letter grade of an F  For starters we tried the house salad and at best it was very average  The ingredients weren't chopped/prepared professionally and the dressing was bland  We mentioned our disappointment to our waitress and she had the manager come over to speak to us  We pointed out the gummy undone crust and he took 50% off the pizza and said he hoped we'd give his store another try  But nothing turns me off more than unjustified hype and Grimaldi's gets way too much credit for basically no reason  I think I'll stick with Oregano'sor heck even Peter Piper has way better pizza.
2767,0,I went to TOCA for major foot pain I waited a long time to see the Dr so when I did they took X-ray of my foot the DR came in and said I had some problm with my foot the reason he said is bc I was old am only 44 but he was only in the room for less than 4 mins threw me some pills to take and told me to go to PT he never even introduce him self not did he ask what has been going on with my foot this place is the worse I have been to I think I will find a new foot Dr bc I still have foot pain this was TOCA in Mesa and I was a new client so why would I go back and spend money when a dr can't even tell u why this happened to my foot other than u r old.
1081,1,I haven't climbed at every gym the area because I'm about a mile away from PRG and I love this place The staff is really friendly and the setters aren't sand-baggers meaning the problems are rated quite difficult If you can climb at PRG you will find it easy to climb most everywhere else including outdoors My only gripe is that their setters aren't very consistent The problems can get very challenging requiring you to think about how to send each route however one 510 might be much easier than another 510 and it's even worse for bouldering where some V2s are like other V1s and some V1s are like other V3s.
1304,1,I have never been more impressed with the attention to detail Dwayne and his wife put into the entire menu From the time you watch Sarah mix your first drink you will realize this place is carefully thought out and time and effort is spent creating a Jamacian experience that is authentic and delicious Eat and drink your way through the menu and you will be amazed.
795,0,I will never come back here They couldn't understand how to make a Mocha Frappe with Hazelnut flavor Once that was finally figured out I overheard that they had spilled my drink dumping half the contents out I saw them pick up the cup and used the same cup to remake my drink when I asked for a new drink in a clean cup the shift supervisor got huffy about it angrily grabbed my drink threw it hastily in the trash can and made me a new drink in a clean cup finally Although they did give me a card that says they were sorry I had a bad experience enjoy a beverage on us that didn't excuse the bad customer service and possible health violation of serving a drink in a dirty cup This Starbucks was very packed and very poorly ran I would expect more out of a place like this and would assume anyone else would have wanted a clean cup as well.

4933,0,Let me start by saying that I used to love this place It is bright airy and the staff is very nice We were always taken care of and food came out promptly and was decent enough But the last time I was there (two Saturdays ago) I don't know what happened The place was a complete disaster an utter chaotic mess I met my friend for brunch at 11 am He was seated at the bar where we were planning on having our meal The bar is small and there were two to three people behind it at all times yet it still took a bartender at least 10 minutes to greet me and ask me for my beverage order (including my friend and me there were five guests at the bar) I ordered an iced tea and we asked for a some menus so we could order (As a former bartender you want to offer your guests menus try to build your clientele get some regulars so this was not impressive service) After about 5 more minutes we had to wave down the bartender to give her our orders We watched her write them down punch the touch screen on the bar computer and still 45 minutes later we still had no food She never talked to us never ran back to the kitchen to check on anything nor did she get a manager involved The other three people at the bar came in at the same time as us and were served in a timely manner Normally we would not wait that long for food but we set a leave time for 12:15 PM and just sort of watched the chaos of the restaurant to see how things would pan out What we noticed was an overstaffed poorly managed restaurant We watched a couple other tables complain to management about long wait times (one guy had waited an hour for his food) Finally 12:15 rolled around Still no food We gave some other girl behind the bar $5 for the tea told her we were not waiting any longer and left She looked like she had heard that from her guests before I left feeling like I just walked out of an episode of Kitchen Nightmares.
3544,0,Bank of Wasting My Time is what their name should be changed to I recently opened an account online with Bank of America After nearly completing the application my computer timed out I didn't want to resubmit the application and have my credit pulled again so I called their online technical support to see if they could verify that my account application had been received But due to their crappy system restrictions I was told that I would need to wait three hours before they could tell me if the application had been completed or not The following day I received an email stating that my account application had been approved and documentation would be sent to me that I would need to return I don't live at the physical address provided (in the process of moving) and they wouldn't accept a PO BOX so I wasn't able to pick up the paperwork until about a week later Going through all of the mail items (5 separate pieces of mail) I found the signature card letter debit card debit card instructions debit card pin number and then a letter stating that the entire account had been closed I called customer service to find out why the account had been closed and the girl on the phone (who sounded like she had marbles in her mouth and was incapable of properly reading the script that was no-doubt right in front of her) told me that the account was in the process of being closed and nothing could be done I asked why the account was being closed and she told me that it was due to suspicious activity I asked her to tell me what the suspicious activity was considering I hadn't even signed the paperwork for the account yet and there wasn't any money in the account She told me that it was suspicious I hadn't returned the paperwork right away It had only been a week since the application had been submitted online and somehow that was suspicious I asked to speak with a manager and have currently been holding for 50 minutes Unless you have buckets of time to waste with this financial disaster DO NOT open an account with Bank of America.

4522,0,It is a great bar IF you are single and have low standards Their brunette bartender Priscilla is the primary reason we longer go there Between her crazy and rude antics and the bar fights amongst the meth heads we have decided that although the bar may be close to home it's just not worth the drive.

4513,0,"Honestly some of the worst food and service I have ever had All of the other breakfast places around were long waits so we checked yelp and although it was a risky at 35 there was no wait and everyone was hungry I wasn't expecting a lot given the 35 star rating but sometimes I've found the more ratings taken can be more important than the rating in Yelp Ordered the huge cinnamon roll chicken fried steak and apple juice Apple juice tasted spoiled told the waitress and her response was a pissed off look then asked ""Well what else do you want then"" (With this start we considered canceling the order and just leaving but we were hungry and unfamiliar with the area so how bad could breakfast be doneBAD as we found out)Cinnamon roll actually tasted decent after I removed the 2 cups of thick icing plopped on top of the rollChicken fried steak was simply nasty Gravy was gross and like the icing on the cinnamon roll was 2 cups of thick bland corn starch filled gravy plopped on the nasty fried steak Like I mentioned earlier I was hungry so I tried to force it down I tried salt pepper and even tried masking the nastiness with tobacco and finally have to give up Eggs 'over easy' were soupy more like sunny side up so it was just bad My wife had French toast and again I would describe the disappointment but you get the point NOTHING was good except for the lady as we walked out gave the kids a dum dum sucker which sums up my visit I was a dum dum for paying and only a sucker would return."
1310,1,Did not have high expectations for the evening It had been a few years since I been to McCormick & Schmick's in Pasadena CA and they did not impress the several times I visited A recent visit to Spenger's in the Bay Area (my old stomping grounds) which had been in decline for years netted a wonderful meal I noticed it had been acquired by M & S  This night did not disappoint  It was a quiet Halloween night and the ambiance was reserved and almost romantic Hot sourdough rolls were a good start Moved onto the flashed fried calamari with a trio of sauces It was light and perfectly done I had side spinach salad my husband the house salad Both were fresh a good size and not overdressed My main was the Lobster and Seafood Steamer It was larger than I expected for the price The seafood steamed in white wine were were perfectly done Came with garlic bread and I just sopped up the sauce Mmmm My husband had the San Francisco Shellfish Stew It had some similarities to my dish but it included fish and the Tomato Fennel Broth was aromatic and delicious as wellI finished the evening with a lovely light bread pudding with Creme Anglaise sauce I was impressed especially for a chain It was a good night I'll be visiting again.
3893,0,Purchased a groupon for Urbano and excited to try a Latin fusion restaurant in old town Scottsdale Although the server was extremely kind and attentive we were sadly let down by the food It started out well with the ambiance and look-shabby chic We had the complementary fried plantains with spicy pico de gallo and chipotle mayo which was very good We then had the beef and potato empanadas-they were light and crispy but beef & potatoes were kind of bland They were good when enhanced with the pico & mayo We also ordered the green chili burger which sounded very promising but was more like a picnic burger w/ a store bought sesame seed bun and flavorless meat It came with fries that had crushed pepper parsley cotija cheese and were completely boring in taste The spices didn't compliment the already dull fries We also had the fish tacos that sounded divine but were fishy (tilapia) and fell flat All these dishes had going for them was the spicy pico de gallo Needless to say we will not be back and would not recommend this place.
1813,1,I've been driving across town from Pinnacle Peak area to see Dr Weinacker at this clinic for the past 4 of the 10 years I've lived in AZ I sure wish I'd known about him sooner because in my part of town all the vet clinics price gouge the heck out of you I have ten animals 3 dogs and 7 cats so I can't afford to start with expensive procedures and kenneling my animal overnight for 'observation'  for minor issues as many of the vets in my part of town want to do For example in my part of town a Valley Fever blood test  runs about $170 The same blood test plus thyroid/kidney panel at PVAH was about one quarter the cost Had I had just the Valley Fever test alone done it would have been considerably less than $170 When Dr Weinacker saw the receipt from my former vet in my account records he quipped that he should raise his prices DON'T YOU DARE  I greatly appreciate that he tries to keep my costs down by recommending lest expensive procedures first He knows he's going to be kept in recreation vehicles by my menagerie alone just kiddingDr Weinacker is a big tall man with an exuberant personality My dogs love this and respond in kind Some of my cats are a bit more reserved and may not be used to his exuberant style but it also serves to keep them docile while getting treated since they don't know himloves animals and some animals  but he sure keeps my female Heeler drama queen occupied while treating her and that's not easyI can't recommend this clinic highly enough.
3640,0,"My boyfriend and I were looking to switch things up for breakfast this past Sunday We'd passed by BLD a few times before and thought we'd give it a try The atmosphere is hip enough and it seemed pretty decently busy My boyfriend ordered the biscuits and gravy while I ordered the traditional breakfast of scrambled eggs wheat toast bacon and I ordered a pancake instead of the breakfast potatoes First time around my eggs were cold Very cold I informed my waitress who had them remade for me Honestly I would rather eat eggs from Denny's than eggs from BLD They were watery and flavorless no matter how much salt and pepper I added The toast came buttered but with no jam or jelly brought to the table Bacon was fine as it's pretty hard to mess up bacon The pancake was large but really just sort of ""meh"" Nothing too terribly exciting As for the biscuits and gravy the entire dish reeked of onion The onion flavor was so strong that it completely overpowered any other flavors that could have been present Finding his dish inedible we left having eaten between us a piece of toast half a pancake and bacon Perhaps the food for lunch and dinner is better but I don't think neither my boyfriend of myself care to find out Overall the atmosphere is nice but the food was awful We won't be returning."
4672,0,I had eaten here a couple years ago and it was decent food and service I think the place has gone downhill When you walk into a place that is empty I'm a Friday night be afraid Prime rib was way overcooked and fatty Veggies were mushy I was wearing nice jeans and a blouse and I felt overdressed compared to other patrons  We won't be back.

2346,0,We have always ordered pizza from doughboys but after today we will Think twice before going back I always do carry out and today went in to pick up our order and the cashier who took my money was also taking phone orders no big deal right Well that was until he gave me my change and went and started making pizzas WITHOUT washing his hands He grabbed two hands full of cheese and put in a cup poured it on the pizza then grabbed sausage and pepperoni and spread all over the same pizza Then he came back up answered the phone and took another order touching the computer and phone then went back to making pizzas again The phone rang again and the manager on duty came up answered the phone touched the computer and he too went back to touching food without washing his hands or putting on gloves I then asked for my $$ back for my 3 pizzas and breadsticks and even after giving me my $$ he still went back to making pizzas without washing his hands Neither one even cared or said they were sorry They were very busy but that is no excuse for what I saw tonight Please take caution when thinking about getting pizza from here.
1058,1,This is my first time owning a pool and we decided to hire a pool company to do the routine service required since I am clueless I am THRILLED with Diamondback Pools level of service Tom called me on Tuesday and we scheduled an inspection and cleaning for Friday He was prompt and verypatient/ helpful in explaining what was going to be required to maintain the pool We have setup for Diamondback to pop out weekly to help us with the routine maintenance Thank you Tom.
4437,0,Haven't had a margarita this bad since my only visit to Salty Senorita Ordered 2 Palomas which call for fresh squeezed lime and grapefruit juice When my better half asked for a shot of beer to calm the tartness the bartender suggested adding more of the grapefruit sodaWhat Total sour belly result and $28 later a lesson learned Always disappointing when you know you could have made a better drink yourself at home.
711,0,I have been in this place a few times since it's near my home and my daughter collects a particular line of action figures The man who has been running it every time I have been there is very unpleasant and basically acts like I am inconveniencing him when I ask questions I overlooked this because this is the only comic book place that carries the line my daughter collects It is either this place or ebay I recently went in to acquire a Valentines Day gift for my little one and was once again treated with unfriendly service They are in their new location and hadn't yet unpacked everything The guy behind the counter acted annoyed and told me to look around for what I was looking for He did not offer to track it down for me or call the dealer who sells the line He also did not seem knowledgeable on the collection itself Okay I guess he can't know everything in his store But what about taking my number and finding out It does after all bring you business to make your customers happy After wasting about 20 minutes of my time in a store that clearly did not care about whether they got my business I left I will never go back in which is too bad because I purchased 3 actions figures for my daughter here on 3 separate occasions I mean I know they are individual dealers but shouldn't they all care about bringing in business Anyway I went home disgusted and bought 2 actions figures online rather than in their store I will not recommend this place to anyone I really wanted to give my business to a local place and the actual dealer who sells the line is lovely (have only met him once) while in the store I should have asked for his number then because you never know when the dealers will be there  Oh well sorry dealer guy I would have eventually collected all you had for my daughter.

1102,1,Fantastic Loved every part of my meal huge portions great drinks and fairly priced Its become the new place I like to show friends that visit from out of town The biggest turn off about this restaurant in the past is the huge line I always see when I drive by but I went on a Sunday morning and there wasn't even a wait Just have to pick the right days I guess.
473,1,Great coffee place Tasty drinks and great price Staff is always friendly and upbeat.
4251,0,"Beef that tastes fishy & other awful experiencesThe arguments that I have seen for this restaurant on other sites as to whether or not it's authentic Mexico City food is not even going to be brought up here there are plenty of other things wrong with this restaurant and the food that simply go against common decent mealsFirst of all it should be noted that unlike most restaurants especially Mexican restaurants chips and salsa and non-alcoholic beverages come with 1 refill only after that you have to pay for extra  The bowl of chips is small - my fellow diner and I went through it quickly waiting for our appetizer  Then after the bowl was empty we were never - never even throughout the entire meal - offered our 'refill' for chips  I understand a restaurant may not want to be wasteful but this is just cheap and tackySecond of all all of the menu items are about $200 overpriced compared to other Mexican or TexMex places I have been to  $1099 goes about as far as 2 tiny - empty - ""cheese"" enchiladas (about 4 inches long w/little inside but cheese suffocating the outside) and two tacos with some meat blobbed on and nothing else  In Mexico this should run me about $400 and in other AZ Mexican restaurants about $899Third the food was just plain awful  Nevermind the appetizer of the skillet of cheese - think cheese pizza without the pizza with extra oil and a nauseating stomachache to follow  We couldn't even eat half of it  And there's no dipping - although hot it's harder cheese that has to be cut with a knife  Then onto the aforementioned enchiladas and tacos  The shredded beef tasted like fish  Makes me wonder what's going on in their kitchen  I lifted up the taco and water poured - not dripped poured - out of the shell explaining why the shell was then soggy and vile  Think wet cardboard  I ate half of the first taco and couldn't stomach it any longer  The enchiladas exemplify the cook's answer to everything - drench and hide the food in cheese and sauce  Nothing was inside except a tad of what seeped in from the outside  I didn't touch the beans - they too looked like they were soaking in a bowl of water but I tried the rice: no texture - almost mush very bland  This should be one of the basicsAnd buyer beware: the ""Suiza"" sauce - which at first glance on the menu one might assume that the sauce is a special house sauce that adds that great vibrant kick to food - is actually just sour cream  Whether they were trying to just sound unique or what on the menu I don't know but as someone who doesn't like sour cream this is only a nuisance  The serviceI suppose E for Effort  Neither of us ate hardly any of the ""food"" (and we aren't the 'send-it-back' type people) and the waitress was completely oblivious  When she asked if we liked it I gave a look like - no - and my boyfriend said it was 'okay' and we clearly didn't want any boxes - you'd think something might have been done at that time - since she did *ask*but no  We were sent on our way and told to ""come back soon""  Nice but denseOverall Mexican or not this can't be a good representation of Mexico  If a Mexican restaurant can't get tacos right they shouldn't be in business  I would never waste another dime there and would discourage friends as well  Bad food overpriced with severely lacking servicethat's probably why the place was nearly empty when we were there on what should have been a busier Wednesday night."
1821,1,this place is amazing  everything is made to order and they have fantastic breakfast dishes and a great selection of bread beer wine and cheeses  i was very impressed with the quality of their food espresso and cleanliness of their store  it is dog friendly and a great place to eat  i hope to come back to this place whenever i am in town---they offer something for everyone and also have a very good gift shop with shirts cards and books and other unique stuff   for those seeking quality food at reasonable prices this place is very hard to beat  i only wish they had one of these in Seattle.

1776,0,I am updating my review since I have visited the BC and had another incident that you folks should be aware of Fraud and theftMy friends and I enjoyed our lunch and we thought nothing of it We all left fair tips and went about our day Two of my friends and I threw our receipts away without verifying the correct amount had posted to our bank accounts (we all either used debit or credit cards) Our other friend balances her accounts monthly and noticed that our server had changed the tip amount after we left She made a $2 tip into a $3 tip $1 isn't a big deal but it is fraudulent behavior and it is theft I'm sure it adds up It could have happened to all four of us that day but three of us didn't do our due diligence and check our accountsMy friend contacted the BC and spoke with Gino the manager He took the information and then asked if my friend wanted her $1 back Well it's not worth driving all the way down there to get $1 I won't post the server's name but everyone beware We don't know if she will remain employed at the BC but you can never be too safe If I were the manager this behavior would not be tolerated It hurts the reputation so badly Check your receipt and your bank account after you dine here Now I certainly will not be returning.

2280,1,This was an amazing night It was a romantic birthday dinner for 2 (entirely planned by my hubby)  The staff greeted me with a signed birthday card they listened to my husband's request for a table with a heater on one side and not on the other (he gets way too hot too fast)  The service was top notch and the food was a bit of heavenIf you go try the Parmesan Fries with the Truffle Aioli with your dinner Any other french fry will suck in comparisonI can't wait to go back They do brunch.
1311,1,I really enjoyed myself here  The atmosphere is really cool  My girlfriend says the smell of the burning fireplace reminded her of Aspen you could smell the wood burning when you pulled into the parking lot  The service was excellent and the food was also very good  We ate downstairs at the bar and chose a few things off the small plates section of the menu  They also had a lot of fresh fish choices on the specials board  I would definitely come back here again.
1657,1,I yelp therefore I am  I've been putting this Yelp review off for a while and after dining there this evening I feel compelled to quit procrastinating and finally put pen to paper (so to speak)  Liberty Market is one of my favorite local restaurants every meal that I have ever ordered there has been exemplary  The staff is knowledgeable about the menu and always extremely courteous   I've spent more than a few evenings there at the pizza bar chatting with Dave the owner/executive chef and he has always made me feel welcome in his restaurant and taken care of me The whole Liberty team is awesome and the entire place is a well oiled machine Here's a list of some of the items I have tried:Salmon BLT - DeliciousWhite Pizza - The best I've ever hadMolinari Pizza - FantasticLiberty Bowl - hearty and deliciousRed Velvet Cake - extremely rich and wonderful (get this and split it with your dining companions)And most recently the Weekender Burger which was cooked to perfection juicy and all-in-all just amazing (see pics)I have and will continue to frequent Liberty Market  Give me Liberty Market or give me death.
2429,0,"What a horrible experience Besides the food being totally awful the 'manager' on duty was rude to every employee working  The cashier (Almaz) was very nice and pleasant Immediately after I placed my order the manager yelled to her 'dont take any more orders and go take lunch' Then the phone rang and the manager answered it 'Mike i've got a line and cant talk' and promptly hung upNow they appeared to have a new employee working the other register After the rude manager gave me my order he went over and pulled a basket of fries out of the fryer I was trying to get their attention to get some ketchup and she proceeded to yell at him for pulling the fries and then told him to help me She then proceded to pull the fries out of the 'serve bin' and dump them back into the fryerOne customer (as i was walking away) made a comment to the manager ""perhaps if you were a little nicer to them they'd listen better"" (referring to how she was treating the  employees)It would have been nice if they provided salt/ketchup without having to ask - but the point is moot as I will NEVER go to this location again I'll eat at the pizza place next door or the Paradise bakery down the hall I have never tried them but they have to be more professional and have better foodSTAY AWAY."
3343,0,"We've moved away from chain restaurants due to the lack of service we typically receive  I almost felt judged by the server because we weren't dressed up  I mean we were in jeans and t-shirts but didn't look like bums  The food was terrible too  The server seemed annoyed that he had to bring us extra calamari sauce and was difficult to find  They claim their pasta is homemade and ""al dente"" but really it was just undercooked  I've had fresh pasta before and never had it served so hard or sticking together  I doubt we'll ever come back."
4953,0,I have attended this club sporadically since it opened sometime in 2010 It has had its up's and down's in terms of basic club/bar service it may depend on what night you attend  My main complaint is that If you ever need to contact someone of authority at this club (don't even bother) But say you Lost/left something behind at the club Had and altercation with a bouncer Were double charged by the bartended on your credit card  Have a complaint Have a compliment  The staff is uncooperative and rude no matter what your situation isId stay away from this club there are other bars and clubs that cater to the same patrons I always feel welcomed to spend my money everywhere/anywhere else in Phoenix.
16,1,As a local boy from Hawaii I made it a quest to find a place that reminds me of home and after living in Phoenix 4 yrs nowI finally found a place that can subdue my craving for a for Korean style plate lunch Plate lunch is a term that us locals like to call our plates from a bbq or local eatery A normal plate that you can get from ONO Hawaiian BBQ L&L BBQ or any other hawaiian places is that every entree comes with rice and mac salad But Korean style plate lunches come with rice and 4 sides like mac salad kimchee cucumber kimchee noodles corn salad and seaweed plus a few other choices Thas the key difference and so far this is the only place I have found thisI like this place the most compared to any other Hawaiian bbq spot out here is that they serve Meat jun and the sides  Meat Jun is thinly sliced marinated beef that is egg battered then pan fried and served with a slightly spicy sauce It is also a Korean entree that originated from Hawaii so don't really expect to find this at any other Korean restaurantsI recommend people to try this place.
3870,0,Food was a C- at best  Server never told us we would be paying $8 a bottle for water  No wonder the busboy kept filing up the glasses  Cesaer salad had no taste the fried chicken was dry and the macaroni and cheese was more like a soup   Oh by the way--the menu says whole chicken but you only get one drumstick and breastOverpriced wine list   Not a good experience  Finally the seats were uncomfortable.
2527,1,So this review is a little late in coming - The domestic atmosphere in my life has been a bit suffocating in these last couple days - Wednesday was a particularly stifling night and for a mid-week change my boyfriend Nathan and I decided to go out to diner instead of just lounging around the house After a long debate on where to go and the realization that it was almost 9:00 and bar food would soon become our only option we stopped in the Melrose District outside a little Italian place called Harley's Even on a Wednesday they were open until 10:00 - The bar until 11:00  Huge sigh of reliefWe were greeted warmly and seated in front of these huge windows that look over Copper Star Coffee and Revolver Records (reviews to follow) Warm fresh baked bread with cracked spices in olive oil for dipping started us off We were talked in to the Mozzarella in Carrozza as an appetizer - This may very well be my boyfriends new food favorite  It's a thick slice of mozzarella sandwiched between two pieces of bread and lightly fried  that's right a kick butt fried grilled cheese  with home made marinara on top not that ghetto crap in a can style of sauce As an entre I had the Pollo Marsala and Fettuccine Alfredo by far the best I have ever had The marsala was slightly sweet served over chicken that was cooked to perfection and the alfredo was super light in taste and texture  Not to mention the fact that our service was impeccable drinks never ran dry and the bread basket was always refilledI'd like to send a special thanks to our waiter Justin - He was a riot He knew about everything on the menu made perfect diner recommendations and was able to convince me and my boyfriend of at least three different lunches diners and deserts that we plan on returning to try He's a local artist with a fantastic sense of humor and a true talent for turning a not so hot evening into a night spent in laughter over little plates of heavenIf you stop by I recommend joining the email list so you can get the weekend update on dinner and drink specials - If you manage it any leftovers will be boxed up for you labeled clearly and double wrapped in cellophane for easy spill proof transport to the fridge Prices are super reasonable too - bigger portions and better food for the same price if not less than the chain style restaurants like dare I say it Olive Garden  Also a portion of the proceeds this Thursday the 24th will be spent helping to raise money for the Food for Life charity What could be better fill your belly without empting your wallet and giving back to a good cause at the same time  Dig it.

2664,1,When you have lived in Hawaii when you have experienced and understand the Aloha spirit and all that it contains you also will understand that food is important to the culture   I can tell you stories about trips planned to infamous restaurants and eateries all over the islands based on lengthy conversations with many who live there  Yes good food is appreciated by the island folksso lets transition to Arizona where you can still find some folks from the islands  As was the case there the conversation quickly turns to great places to eat and where to find that great island style food that we grew to love  I was so excited to find that this place was good and super close to where we live  We have been there often since  We have even used them to cater our oldest sons Hawaiian stlye Bday party last year   Food is great local style   Just what the Dr ordered   A bit of Aloha in Arizona cant get better than that.

4881,0,We have been to Pearl many times and always found mediocre service but the food has always been pretty good Tonight was the last time I will ever go to Pearl We received 3/5 rolls and then nothing for about 30 minutes We were patient and finally asked that if they weren't being made we would just take the check and skip the other two Tracy (male) our server had no idea what we had even ordered He then asked why our el diablo roll was half eaten We said we did not really like it He returned a while later with the check no discount applied for half of our dinner missing or the food we didn't like We put a card down right away and he continued to flirt with the table next to us Needless to say we won't be back There is better sushi in Old Town with much better service Very disappointing night.

4629,0,I am not too keen on giving negative reviews but holy God I will never give them my money again Now this is the first time that I have ordered from Vermont but I've had it catered before and so I wanted to get some delivered to my house So I call order three full sandwiches one half and three cookies No special orders or add-ons All as they come The bloke on the phone says that it's going to be 40 minutes I'm at the extreme edge of their service radius and it's about to be lunch time so I figure that's totally acceptable and I go about my business  About 45 minutes go by and I'm feeling the munch so I give them a holler and I realize that he never gave me a total while I wait on hold for five minutes he comes back to the line and tells me that the order left 'seven or eight minutes ago' so it should be in my hungry hands shortly I take it in stride I've been in a good mood all day it's all good Another twenty minutes go by and I've gone from completely calm and not at all affected to full-on angry The driver finally shows- an hour and a half late and I've never been this upset about a sandwich before in my life No apology whatsoever for being egregiously late- something that would result in free food with many other establishments- and then he hands me the check I'm about to sign the slip then I do some quick math and realize that they charged me 7500 For four sandwiches For keeping my cool I deserve a Green Lantern ring but I hand it back to the driver and tell him that I'm not signing it and he tells me that the guy ringing it up screwed up the order Yeah I see that You charged me double That's more than a mistake He leaves promising to have someone call me I take the sandwiches hoping to at least enjoy my food- nope Cold Should have guessed Half an hour later someone finally gets back to me and explains that they overcharged me- still no apology for my food taking twice as long as it was supposed to mind you and he said that he was going to void the original charge (it's still showing in my bank account as a charge) and recharge me but he was going to take the cookies off Because that would make it all better I asked him how much he was charging me for and he responded 'I have no idea' Again I managed to not kick a hole in the nearest child and wear it as a bleeding backpack capable of hatred I don't even think that I let my open-faced contempt seep into my voice when I asked him to find out how much so I didn't wind up with a hundred dollar charge because I wanted a sandwich He finally came back with a total and I ended the call When I first stumbled across their site I didn't get around to ordering because they stop delivering right around the time I get home and they don't have an online option for ordering but my office started getting their food catered in I want to tell them to stop I've not had to deal with that much BS to just get a simple meal over the past two years  Never Never Ever again.
1334,1,05/05/10Another great update from the Smokehouse Grill-- the Steak and cheese sandwich (comes w/ your choice of side) one of a few on the daily specials' board  The waffle fries alone would make any meal worth the daily special price but my pick today was just shoe-dropping good  The meat was cooked just right- superbly seasoned and had great texture  I love onions best when they're caramelized and these had a nice bite to it and added just enough sweetness to counteract the saltiness of the cheese  Oh but don't forget the bread  These had a great crusty exterior and yet soft inside Yum  I want another please.
3329,0,We ordered the shrimp lo mein and beef and vegetable dish The lo mein has horrible bland no flavor even with extra sauce The vegetables with the beef were raw I never had such bad food at any other pei wei before.
3120,0,Had wanted to check this place out for awhile since It is a Packer Bar and they were supposed to be known for their green chile cheeseburger  - Walked in and almost every table was reserved for the game so it was a good atmosphere if you are a Packer fan and that is where the highlights endedIt took about 30 minutes to get a beer when i initially asked about the order she stated she was getting to it and then proceeded not to come back to the table for another hour  we ended up going up to the bar to make future orders after that instead of waiting for the waitress (however that issue was solved after the 1st Quarter perhaps they were short staffed) Ordered their famous Green Chile burger and fries and got raw fries and a burger burnt to a crisp was pretty unedible however the green chile could hide the burnt taste to get a couple bites downBeers are cheap here - certainly eat before you come here will not be making a return visit pretty disappointing.
1010,1,John and associate were on time for our move were friendly and courteous moved everything quicker than expected We saved time and came in under budget No problems at all and nothing was broken Use this service I can't recommend them enough.
432,1,I have been going here for a couple of months and love this place She always takes her time to make sure she does a great job Kathleen is so friendly and is like a psychologist and just listens to your stories and problems After she has completed her work she always asks if you are satisified and always offers to put on more lashes if you are not satisfied (which never happens) Her prices are amazing and I would not go anywhere else.
1423,1,We love this place  Great variety and quality of good for a reasonable price  Delicious custard and other comfort food are a big draw for us.
3693,0,"Was a member for two years but the lack of customer service finally got to me If you go don't be surprised if they loose your appointment an then offer to reschedule (what a joke) and then hang up on you - seems like the motto for this location is ""it wasn't my fault talk to my manager""."
817,0,WARNING do not go here I bought $15000 dollars of plants here about 2 weeks ago and one of the plants had a pod on it that I didn't see and it opened and now the plant is infested with bugs I put this plant and some pansies i bought there in my atrium where I have no other plants and now I have bugs everywhere When I called the nursery and told them what happened they said oh well All the other nurseries guarantee their plants this place sells you diseased plants on purpose knowing you will be stuck with them I used to go there all the time I will never go back Beware.
55,1,"Ok you want quick and amazing food that takes you to your childhood even if you're not Mexican Reyes de la Torta will do it I had always heard about this place from the youth I worked with They said it was amazing Once I went I was hooked You're going to get a completely different feel from this place Yeah it's in a strip mall yeah the hostess may stick you and your party at a table smaller than you're accustomed to Yeah there is soccer playing on the TVs instead of the news  but the food will make you not care about any of those things Plus they are always playing Salsa not loud or rambunctious trumpet-filled music This adds to the experience as it makes me feel like I may be somewhere resembling my homeland of Colombia When you're asked for your drink order make sure you ask for one of their aguas frescas translation: fresh juice I always get the Agua Fresca de Limon It reminds me of the limeade I drink when I am back home in Colombia - this drink makes the whole experience worth it  The chips and salsa are good although you might want to watch out with the salsa if you're not a spice fan Ok the restaurant is named the king of the tortas  and you ask what is a torta To Mexican people a torta is sandwich of meat vegetables and anything else they may throw on there made on a hamburger-style bun - and that is what they're famous for -  that is why Adam from Man vs Food went there But I have never had their tortas simply because at Reyes you will enter a homemade-tortilla heaven that is like nothing else These tortillas are amazing from their texture to their slight greasiness to their taste they are the best tortillas I have ever had So in order to continue to eat the best tortillas ever I always get the chicken quesadilla Yep it's simple but amazing You can also choose to get it ""Estilo del Rey"" which means they top off your quesadilla with more cheese ( white cheese not crappy yellow greasy cheese) sour cream and green onions That in itself sends this quesadilla into the history books Do yourself a favor and check out a truly unique restaurant tucked away in a strip mall just south of Hatcher on 7th Street Make your way up to Sunnyslope and see what the buzz is about."
3477,0,I live close by so I keep coming back but this may be my last time The food is really good - the service however is slow and disorganized  It was 25 min after I ordered when I asked when it might be ready The people sitting around me were having the same issue - very disappointing.
4623,0,I assume this place is owned by the same people who own the 16th street location but if it is OMG what are you doing polluting your brand  Stopped there the other night before a flight and was excited because I like the orginal  No ambience and I had this waitress who looked and acted miserable  She also made me feel rushed  So she pushes the special tequila margarita and i get one  Just okay  Then I ask if you can mix and match tacos don't want four of the same taco  No  Then I order a  chile plate and it was so cold and gross it was inedible  I sent it back and asked for guamamole and chips which was actually quite good  Although when the waitress was preparing it tableside she seemed bored and irritated   To her credit she didn't charge me for the chile  Real disappointment go next door to the Grande Orange cafe.
199,1,While visiting friends in Scottsdale (from Seattle where we are spoiled with good Thai food) we got a craving and our friends suggested Thai House Everything was so good I had the lunch special with panang curry Could have been a little spicier (though I did only order 2 star) but otherwise it was perfect Will be sure to come back here on my next trip to Phoenix.
4285,0,Ordered a pizza from this place using grubHub - the pizza was HORRIBLE expensive took forever (longer than GH promised) and arrived COLD Will NEVER order from this place again The pizza was so disgusting that it seemed that they used velveta fake cheese on it it was so bad that we had to trash it.
3285,0,Worst service I have received in a long time  We were a party of four  After waiting 20 minutes to order we were told that we were given the lunch menu but that they would let us order anyway  Then our server switched but failed to tell the new server our order  Once he put it in another 20 minutes later we were told we could have a sandwich and we need to order something else  They also didn't have any white sangria left and told us they were too busy to make more  Don't waste your time  Grimaldi's up the street has better food and service.
3637,0,Delightful atmosphere that is full of color and wonderful design Mariachis were playing tableside which made the atmosphere fun You immediately think good food is aheadThe foodnot so great The food was very bland The chips did not seem homemade The menu suggests wonderful flavors in their food but there actually  wasn't any pizazz or flavor to anything we had Don't pay extra to try any of the salsasblehThe service was horrible The waiter did not know the menu nor could he make recommendations as to what the best food was on the menu I flat out asked him what was most popular and he pointed out a salad He didn't understand us when we asked questions and he did get some of our order wrong I am really shocked how packed it was considering the flavors weren't good We had tacos quesadillas beans/rice and tried various salsas If you like authentic Mexican Food native to Arizona this isn't the place for you The food was overpriced and the drinks seemed reasonably priced I will not go back to this place.
457,1,"Lovey love love this boutique Finally checked it out on a First Friday of all nights even though I regularly stop at Roosevelt right next door The clothes are incredibly cute but just too expensive for me to justify buying Not like Urban Outfitters expensive and cute though - at least this stuff is unique and good quality so if I had an extra $90 lying around I would totally buy myself a sweater or shirt or that darling pea green corduroy a-line skirt with the swallow patch I love the dresses but a hundy on a dress will have to wait til I get a raise (boo salary freeze/recession) However the jackets were incredibly reasonably priced around $100050 and again very cut Men's clothes - not totally my taste a lot of JT style hats and button down shirts ala martini ranch ""I'm dressed up""But I can afford the jewelry and oh it is cute cute cute Picked up a five-piece simple silver toned ring for $6 - yeah you heard me $6 - and I get compliments on it all the time Also picked up a nice little silver feather necklace for the sister for xmas and she loved it The sis had seen one at UO or something for like $29 but I got her the one every girl at HH *won't* have for $18 AND i can say about the men's selection is that I LOVE the hand-screen-printed (can you hand screen print Does that makes sense) ties ($30) In bright jewel tones like peacock blue hot pink and lime green with awesome prints like an octopus  or a bicycle Bought one for the BF for xmas and gave it to him early so he could wear it at his friend's xmas party and it was a hit Very unique and incredibly stylish - and I'm a winner cause I'm the cool ass GF that got it for him Everybody winsI was going to give four stars but how cool is shopping before hh at the Roosevelt I'll tell you - very effin' cool Another star and BB is outta this world Ow."
3482,0,We had a very frustrating and disappointing experience with Nova Home Loans Although we are very well qualified buyers our loan processor seemed unable to understand our financial picture We responded in a timely manner to all requests for information even when that information was clearly unnecessary to the loan process and cost us money out of pocket Our loan processor was consistently unable to articulate what was needed and worse offered erroneous information to the seller's agent a clear breach of ethics When Nova Home Loans informed us days before escrow was set to close that they could not fund our loan we went to our preferred lender in CA Logix was able to fund our loan within 10 days Unfortunately that was too late for the sellers and we lost the house Very disappointing and inconvenient to say the least We were able to close on another home but paid $20000 more than originally planned due to rapidly escalating home prices in the Phoenix area Although some members of the team were courteous on the phone we cannot recommend Nova Home Loans to anyone hoping to buy a home in the Phoenix area.
1836,1,My go-to place for a special occasion The seafood towers are incredible the steaks are perfect and they make one of the best cosmopolitans around.
4884,0,"Zero supplies (eg Flat rate envelopes) in the self service area Now have to make another trip Also there was a handwritten sign made out to the attention of ""costumers""."
3991,0,Very upset with the service an way of handling their customers  Was charged 2500 to try and check in at 2 pm instead of 3 pm when half the hotel was empty  Room was 92 degrees when we walked in and had to wait about 2 hours for the room to cool off on a day where the high was nearly 115 degrees  Checked out the following morning and after 5 days saw a charge on my credit card for 15000  Apparently I was charged for a door lock that was damaged by someone who satyed there before me No call or contact by the hotel management was ever made just charged my card and figured I would never see the charge on my card I suppose Horrible.

3598,0,"I have been going to this MImi's Café on a regular basis for the last 13 years but earlier this week they have completely rearranged the menu and most of my old favorites are gone  The food quality has gone down considerably too  The Cobb Salad used to be great but the last time I was there there were just a few bits of hard boiled egg tomato bacon and blue cheese in what was mostly just a bowl of shredded lettuce  And they charged me $9 for that  The manager who speaks really hard to understand English did not seem to think anything was wrong with that  The fans on their Facebook page are in open revolt and all the Mimi's Café people can say is ""change is hard"" and that people should try something else on the menu  They don't get it  The burden of persuasion is on them not the customer  Stay away at least until they come to their senses."
1774,1,I love this property  It is tucked nicely on the side of a mountain and when you enter the property grounds you feel like you checked out of Phx and stepped into a nice tropic bungalow I think the pools are beautiful and the rates aren't too terrible  The rooms are very contemporary which made it very 5-starrish  But the price of the mini-bar in the room - STAY AWAY.
1347,0,"Not greatDON'T waste your calories  The cake was dry over cooked and very bland tasting  Frosting did not have a lot of flavor and was way too sweet   We picked up 7 different cupcakes for my birthdayand I tried all 7  Honestly I could make better cupcakes out of a box  Plus waiting 10 minutes at the counter for someone to come to the front to wait on useven when I said ""HELLO"" several times trying to let them know we were there  Meanwhile two other people came in and waited awhile and then left  When they FINALLY came to the front counterno apology or explanation  I so WISH I WOULD HAVE USED MY BIRTHDAY CALORIES on NOTHING BUNDT CAKES next door  What a waste of calories  DEFINITELY go to NOTHING BUNDT CAKESthey are ALWAYS FRESH moist and wonderful flavor."

3993,0,I waited over a year to re-try this place The theory was: If they stayed in business this long maybe they've fixed things The menu is better with more selections Service is slow which doesn't mix well with airport crowds There are too many tables per sq foot and people consistently walk into table Good place to go if the world runs out of restaurantsFood was 2 starService 1 starAmbiance 1 star (because zero isn't permitted).
1921,1,This place is simply amazingWe eat there at least once a weekFor many yearsDefinitely a place to go for people who appreciate good food and service.
811,0,This place is LITERALLY on top of a nightclub If you like feeling at 1:52am that you're in the middle of a party scene while laying in bed than this may be the place for you Unfortunately for me I like to sleep I will never stay here again.

2704,0,Noisy  Poorly sound proofed rooms means that every car with booming stereos outside you have to listen to  I have never had this noisy of a hotel room  Even worse some family upstairs appeared to be practicing tap dancing based on the racket they were making  No wi fi in the rooms you have to use wired Internet accessHaving the Arizona Mills shopping center across the street was handy for xmas shopping  The free breakfast was good.
2255,0,"I organized a corporate dinner event for 50 employees I had not been to Richardson's before but had heard great reviews and was excited to host our event at this special space I walked into the restaurant and was greeted with rude service from the start A waitress actually yelled out behind me ""MOVE"" It appears that the staff was overwhelmed and acted as though they did not know the specifics of our reservation which we had gone over with the events person in detail weeks prior After speaking with the manager the service did improve and I have to say the food was fantastic It is a beautiful special space and they serve amazing food but the service was not good."
1576,0,Trust me I worked at a Chinese take out place before and this rice here is stale and day old because fresh rice does not look off white and is not so hard  Spring rolls when fried once are light brown in appearance but refried ones that were not sold the day before and thrown back into the deep fryer turns the edges dark brown and greasy  Some folks might try to say the oil is just darker but darker oil in the fryer means its not been cleaned and changed regularly enough that its gotten to a gunky black color  It's a troublesome process and it is true that most places do not do it often enough but U have to do it before it starts to corrupt the taste and appearance of your foodThe chicken and broccoli I had was not great at all  Its several small slices of chicken and broccoli that are coated with a thick black sauce  Overly starched and overly salted  Does not have any flavor at all  If this is NY style Chinese food then its not the NYC I have been to  My friend had their teriyaki chicken and its bad too : (  Same stale rice with pieces of oversauced chicken  He said after it tasted kind of weird not the teriyaki taste he was expecting  Again too much starch and salt  And this is the dude that eats everything Dear fellow yelpers stop short changing yourself  Please stop accepting fresh vegetables as a criteria for being good Chinese food  Neither does big shrimp crisp cabbage in egg rolls big pieces of meat qualify as criterias for good Chinese food  Guys U have to send me a message if you do not agree and I can give U a list of Chinese food places to go eat at where all of the above is a given and the decision lies in taste  If your criteria is a lot of decent food for a good price that's perfectly fine too send me a message and I can point U in the right direction to a good Chinese buffet seafood or no seafood  But please do not rate this place as 5 stars because a 2 star is generous  I gave them 2 cause the service is good and they keep the place pretty clean and neat  I think I am too generous already.

3002,1,Why I haven't written a review for Windsor earlier I'm not sure as I've been going there since it first opened but it's a good one so I guess better late than neverThe owners of Postino just can't go wrong I'm convinced I'm a long time fan of both locations and was super excited when they opened up Windsor as they have a full bar and different numerous options for food Let's start with the interior love it Modern with some natural elements very laid back with an awesome patio that I've actually yet to sit on as I'm usually at the bar or one of the comfy booths as soon as you walk inThe staff is always on point and friendly without being too in your face which I really love being that I am a server and I don't really need the follow up every 4 minutes I most recently sat at the bar solo on Wednesday or Thursday and I didn't get the bartender's name but he was really nice without being overbearing Food wise Omnomnom is all I have to say No the Backyard burger is awesome I've only gotten it Classic style but it's delicious The meat is flavorful and the portion is generous to say the least I'm also a big fan of their fondue and the Brown Bag () Chicken sandwich Everything tastes fresh and you can't go wrong with Churn next door for the dessertbest Butter Pecan I've ever hadThis area has some solid restaurants and Windsor is no different Definitely a great spot for lunch during the day or a date at night Check it out.
2216,0,this review is for the Blonde bartender: Dont plan on her remembering who you are even if you come in frequently my main gripe is: Happy hour actually starts 500 minutes PAST 4pm and Ends a good 10 minutes BEFORE 7pm I know this cuz Blonde charged full draft price on my first drink when I sat down at 3:59 (seriously thats what my cell phone time said) Also another visit I show up at 6:50 still get charged full priceso lets review a few minutes of difference and you end up spending about $905 more depending on how many pints you orderI mean that could have been decent tip money for her I'll continue to go however if she keeps pulling this shit I'll just stop tipping her completely.

4047,0,Disappointed  This place is a half step up from a Subway  I sure it's ok for those who have not had the experience of a true New York Deli  The confusion of where to place an order was the first thing I noticed as well as the next three unlucky customer's  A deli that does not serve fries what's up with that Sorry Jason's Deli you flunked the test.
18,1,For the past year and a half I've had Whitey's service my car whenever something wasn't under the Infiniti warrantee  And I'm nearly giddy that my warrantee is up so that I can have only JP's eyes and hands on my precious carWhitey's has fit me in whether I was calling the day before or two weeks prior  This isn't for a lack of business (actually the place nearly always seems super busy) but because they genuinely want to make their customers happyI trust that I'm getting honest opinions thorough work and a fair price  Each time JP explains what work he did what work will need to be performed in the near/distant future and the pricing for it all so that I can be prepared for what I'll spend (and avoid finance-induced heart complications)Certainly I could go into greater detail about my various experiences at Whitey's but there's no point when they've all be stellar  Bottom line  They're awesome in all the ways that matter and even some that don't.

1986,1,Amazing service from a family owned and operated business Their attention to detail is unrivaled We had to put a sick cat down this week Because of his problems he was urinating all over the house Scott and Chris Dial brought our house back to 100% in a couple of hours at a shockingly reasonable price Their enthusiasm for their craft is visible We won't use anyone else.

4546,0,I purchased two groupons for this place as it sounded very much like Chipotle which I love  My friends and I went in there last night for two salads  The salad bowls are half the size of Chipotle the meat is cut so small that it looks like hamburger  I asked for brown rice and the guy tried to give me pinto beans (I told him 3 times that is not rice - those are beans)  Brown rice is not even available  They pride themselves on a peri peri marinade but the meat had zero flavor actually everything was bland no flavor  The cook was busy tossing chips (supposed to be in a bowl) but they landed all over the floor and he just looked at them  The cashier was nice friendly and seemed to be the only one of the two employees working  He dished up the food rung people up replaced forks etc while the cook was on his cell phone complaining about other employees / managers  The bar area had a decent sized TV but it was turned off  The restaurant has a bar area that would be great to sit and surf the net on WiFi but it is not available  The cook's laptop and newspapers were spread all over the counter leaving no room for customersThe whole time we were there maybe 10 people came in  Several came in and leftThe music was ok but a bit loud for concrete floors and high ceilings as it echoed and seemed much louder  I don't want to return there let alone use my other groupon  I'll contact Groupon to see if that can be refunded.

4763,0,A group of us stopped in here on a Friday night because we had heard it was finally open and wanted to see what it was all about We all love retro type places and things so the idea of a new tiki bar was kind of exciting Alasit just wasn't a very good experience even though our server was trying really hard to make it right I would give him personally 5 stars for that But it was just boring I wanted it to be different I guess I know that the owners have worked really hard and I can appreciate that very much A lot of time and thought went into the decor and it shows if you like the watered down idea of tiki (I liked the artwork) There was just nosoul When I think of tiki I see over the top It just seemed like another bland contemporary place to drink Maybe if I was a young hipster I would have enjoyed it better I asked for a daiquiri but they apparently don't do blended drinks At a TIKI bar they don't I was amazed Then they couldn't get my other drink choice right so the bartender sent a mystery drink over but didn't tell me or the server what it was I didn't like it and I didn't really appreciate just being thrown something randomly I always carry the recipe for my drink with me and even with that the bartender couldn't get it right Also the water we were served tasted terrible and had floaty things in it I have very specific taste and I do know this but I was really hoping for something better None of us wanted to come back.
2585,1,Ditto all the other positive reviews  So I'm just going to get right to it and just say you have to just go and experience LUSH for yourself  Let them know you are a first timer and they will take you for a tour through have they have  My favorite is the Love Lettuce Mask Reminds me that I need to go get more.
2612,0,"I went to this place because the front of their takeout menu said ""NY Style Chinese Restaurant""  It was anything but  I'm from New York and my favorite Chinese dish is Szechuan Beef  And in New York all Chinese restaurants make it the same way: dry shredded beef with carrots celery and scallions cut into matchsticks and bits of chili peppers  I don't know what they were thinking by calling the stuff they gave me Szechuan Beef  It was slices of beef (not dry-fried shredded) it was in a tomato-ey sauce with hunks of peppers onions celery mushrooms water chestnuts and everything else they probably had leftover lying around It wasn't spicy (even though it said spicy on the menu) Their hot and sour soup wasn't hot or sour It wasn't the rich brown fragrant soup I remember from NY it was slightly gelatinous light amber and had barely any flavor It looked and tasted like doctored-up chicken soupI also got an order of pork fried-rice  The pork was ok but the rice was BRIGHT ORANGE and had no flavor Since when is fried rice supposed to be orange  Didn't have the bits of egg either It's as if they started with bland leftovers and tried to ""spice"" (I use that term with great sarcasm) it up with food coloring to try to pass it off as flavorful Well it fell flatI would recommend Panda Express over this sham of a chinese restaurant I'm angry I wasted $12."
2090,1,Friend took me here when I was visiting and didn't have any idea what I wanted to eatjust that I needed some foodand a beer sounded good too  This place is great  Cool atmosphere and good brewsI got the Tap Room Tenderloin and a Hefeweizen to wash it all down  Both were very good  Also got to sample a piece of their tasty quesadilla  All good and I look forward to sampling more of the menu in the future.
4218,0,This place is a joke There is nothing resort like about it The organization has been pathetic the rooms  are less than impressive and you are by nothing interesting Don't waste your time Save your money up and go to your local holidays inn cause it is no different Anybody that even for a second considers buying a time share here is off their rocker.
1733,1,What a wonderful experience We actually were told about this local gem by a waiter at another restaurant Then we found out that they had also been featured on one of my favorite shows Diners and Drive Ins so I figured if it got raves from Guy I couldn't pass up a chance to visit too From the first friendly hello when you enter the door you are treated as if you are an old friend even if  you're a first time visitor like I was  The food is amazing Homemade pasta is so yummy Be advised portions are very generous-so share or be prepared to take home leftovers which is not a bad thing Everything from appetizers to deserts can be shared and you will still leave feeling very satisfied and very happy that you have been to Giuseppe's on 28th.

2846,1,This is the nicest city pool in the whole east valley It is more like a small water park A huge lap pool a seperate pool with a large kiddie play area 2 water slides spray pad whirlpool lazy river Cheap fun for the whole family Hours vary so go to their website for summer hours They do get VERY busy in the summer and are often to capacity by 1pm so go when they open or later in the afternoon around 2 or 3 and you should be fine.
1723,1,This dennys has changed a lot in the past 2 months It appears a new manager or corporate finally came to visit and cleaned the place up No more mad waitresses or 50 minute waits for 1 plate of food Way to go.
4069,0,My experience here was great until about 45 minutes after I ate I devoured a golden brown waffle two crispy and moist pieces of fried chicken and still had room for a few bites of buttery grits On the way back to Mesa in the car though it all went wrong I got super sick from Lo-Lo's chicken and was holed up in bed for two days on my vacation with all the signs of food poisoning (i'll save you the gory details) I will never go back here and recommend staying away from this place despite the great reviews  It might be awhile before I can stomach any fried chicken again.
4332,0,Star CarWash definitely has better drying system My front and back windows with really bad job when you buy ANY of the washes Good vacuums hoses Good and nice shade for you to dry your car There is a tiny tiny zinc to wash your hands I guess They sell microfiber rag for $2 because this place doesn't include a rag with any of your washes Over all I recommend to go to StarWash cCar Wash if you are picky and just drive away with out drying your car yourself CLEANFREAK you must get off and dry the windows yourself I would love to see a place where you can wash your mats with a hose and brush This place offers wonderful monthly packages but their poor job didn't convince me to get on They have packs for $358 bucks Get the $5 cause $8 pack doesn't seem to have any difference I bought one at Star CarWash but expired and I was very pleased Employees here are very helpful and professional For an emergency this place is ok.
3162,0,Doesn't seem very clean staff is rude waited 30 mins for a burrito thatwasn't what I ordered Food was ok.
716,1,Went here the other night and I ordered the chopped salad the pimientos and some red sangria The pimientos which are cooked peppers were SOOOOO good There were a few spicy peppers in there which made this appetizer flavorful The chopped salad was the usual deliciousness I got it without cheese and with the lime dressing instead of the creamy chipotle dressing they put on it In the past I have had it with the chipotle dressing and it's reallllllly goodThe red sangria was good a little sweet but the fruit was plentiful and it was refreshing I like sweet though so it's all good.
3652,0,**WARNING** do not eat here  Had a birthday dinner here last nightTerrible experienceI will be balanced hereif you want to sit on the patio with friends people watch and have drinks this is a good choiceThe wine list is good with reasonable prices no extreme markup  Now the badService What service Our server was beyond clueless  Their corn bread was mushy and coldwhen we pointed it out to the server said she knows everyone complains about it  When asked for just plain bread she brings out a basket with 3 pieces for 4 people  When we point this out we never get anymore bread I am not joking hereI would have left if I could but as we were out with another couple for the wifes birthday I had to gut it out  They also keep their wine downstairs somewhere(swing for a wine fridge will you) and we picked the one bottle they couldn't find  You say talk to a managerwell we sure did Mr Robert Rogers came over to say how sorry he was and how things would be great from then on Yet another empty promise as water glasses go unfilled and coffee wasn't even offered as the server just brought the check  I saw other guests getting french pressed coffee why not us I guess you don't even get a choice about desert and coffee anymore The room acoustics are terribleA DJ  why Is it a club or a place to eat  It is very loud & there is no dance floor Bathrooms are disgusting(the ladies had to tell Robert Rogers the manager there was no toilet paper UGH) This place tries really hard to be cool and fails in a big wayFred Unger please close this mistake down asapI expected much more from Unger who was responsible for Lon's and Royal Palms but then again Lon's was always hit and miss  revolving chefs and menus Again DO NOT EAT HERE Go else where.
2408,1,I went here with my husband on a Saturday nightwe had just walked out of The  Blue Hound Bar after receiving terrible service& this place was a breathe of fresh air- we ordered their special at the time- a vegetarian lavosh flatbread and it was A-MAZING Also had a few of their specialty drinks among which the Rhode Island Iced Tea was a standout This place has a charming atmosphere and great servicewe will definitely be returning when we are in the area.
2386,1,Awesome decor great service hidden gem in Scottsdale Delicious and unique menu The lamb fondue was so great the trout salads and chicken Interesting bread basket with an assortment of muffins and breads and a diverse dessert menu They need something a bit more chocolate on it )Great place  One of the best restaurants I have been to in Scottsdale.
3497,0,Bottom line Danny's Family Carousel Car Wash is NOT worth your business Save your time and money Your car will not properly be tended to and the staff especially the Management (Oscar and Martin) couldn't be anymore unprofessional or empathetic If you care about actually having your car washed this is NOT the place to go I have been a faithful customer to this specific location for 3 years since moving into the Biltmore I used to get my gas oil-changes and vehicles washed here but time and time again (chance after chance) my car was left to air dry rims never cleaned or towel dried forgotten about the air freshener etc I've even had to ask on multiple occasions to have the window writing wiped off before I drove off It is clearly the most unorganized group of employees I have every witnessed at a car wash facility I'm a reasonable guy but when you see a vehicle that happens to be a newer make or model take Presidence over yours (even though you paid the same) it is NOT okay An on-sight employee gave me Heather's (Danny's Daughter) number in the Corporate office that I ended up leaving 3 messages for requesting a call back to bring the latter to her attention A week later I received a call back from the receptionist saying that she is TOO busy to return my calls A week after that call a random number called my phone 602-694-2244 and a man (Brian) informed me that Danny does not want my business anymore I was appalled and tad confused Brian had no knowledge of my ongoing experiences I am to this moment embarrassed for him that he would even be instructed to make such a ridiculous  call This is a lot to read but if it helps you to make a more informed decision and avoid some serious frustration let alone having to get your car re-washed then great If anyone would like photos (clearly showing the facility my vehicle  and its neglect please let me know) I also have a video showing a Mercedes that was hand washed after mine (the guys spent an extra 3 minutes and 23 seconds on a vehicle twice as small as mine)  Regards Chad B.
1231,1,Branching more into unknown territories of International foods Burmese has been on my radar since reading about a wonderful place in San Francisco So when I heard that there was a Burmese place here in the valley well I got excitedThe place is awesome Crossed somewhere between Asian style and Indian style we were all very surprised on how well the food is prepared We ordered about 13 dishes with our friend (plenty of leftovers) ranging from coconut rice to beef short rib curry The flavors were great and very unexpected in terms of simple preparation of high quality ingredients Standouts were the ginger salad (mixed table side) pork belly curry and the coconut rice Not only was everything just incredibly tasty but also well priced Add another tasty mom and pop owned restaurant to the valley its a real winner.
2674,1,My trip to the Nordstrom Cafe was like everyone else'sI did not know what to expectWalking in I thought it was a restaurant where you get seated but figure out the stand in line cafeteria style type which did not bug me at allI found it kinda cool actuallyWalking down the line there were soooo many different food options and each one looked amazingly goodKudos for the displays the let people see what the dish looks like and how big the portions areI opted for the cranberry turkey sandwich and a soda as well as a Snickerdoodle cookieAfter paying you then get seated by a server and your food gets delivered to youOur server Salvadore was tremendousThe service from him was impeccableHe was super niceMy cranberry turkey sandwich was really really good(I am not exaggerating)It also came with some plain potato chips which were greatMy Dr Pepper was always filled and my cookie was heavenlyThis cafe really blew my mind expecially because it's located in the Nordstrom in the mallI will for sure return to the Nordstrom cafe and I am anxious to try the tomato soup.
762,0,We ordered a steak sandwich and the raspberry chipotle boneless wings everybody was raving about  The steak in the sandwich had no flavor I've had better steak at a chinese buffet  The bread was kind of nasty  almost stale but I think its just how it comes  The tots were the thing we liked but how do you screw that up  The wings were shrivelled - kind of like chinese food in a way where they batter and fry up chicken pieces that are sliced thin and then cover with sauce  The ends were dried up chicken and batter that were more like jerky than wings  The sauce was creative but definitely not the next ranch or honey mustard  Maybe a little more of a spicy kick would make it betterAll in all won't go back  Mostly because we don't live in the area so the next time we're there we'll try something else  If it was in my neighborhood I might go back for happy hour  Their drinks looked pretty cheap and I wouldn't feel so bad about the wings if I'm paying half price and drunk.
515,1,"This is a great little shop I went in for recommendations on a pool pump after having a less than great experience at another outfit (let's just say they rhyme with ""schmezlies"") These people really know how to take care of their customers Their staff showed me an assortment of options for my broken pool pump had reasonable prices on the best replacements and even went the extra mile to help fix other issues with my cleaning system Their pool tech (the guy who comes to install the equipment) was also knowledgeable and friendly and was patient to explain what was going on with the current and future setups Overall a great experience and now I can enjoy my pool the way it was meant to be enjoyed."
2168,1,Ordering looks like a challenge at first bit it's not  Highly recommend the JENRED pork it's like sweet and sour pork but with a spicy twist  Portions are good and they serve your meal with a snickerdoodle or chocolate chip homemade cookie  It's a hole in the wall with super awesome food.
131,1,The customer service here is wonderful The employees are always energetic and happy to help out even if it's 5 AM Of the two options for Starbucks this one is by far my favorite choice because of the quick service amiable employees and cool interior Most Starbucks stores have busy bodies as employees but this store's employees are attentive to the customers and are happy to help and converse with them as needed The drinks are fantastic and I have never had them make a mistake on my order they are wonderful I really like to go in and see one of their employees Allie because she is always bright-eyed and cheery and ready to help out anyone that walks into the store The full crew is energetic and I wouldn't suggest getting coffee from anywhere but this store.
4243,0,"This company is horrible They have the ""small business feel"" of three people that seem inconvenienced when you want to rent a truck from them They like to claim things are fraud that actual successful businesses do everyday They have horrible customer service skills and even work business practice/ethics Thanks to them i'll never use another budget truck rental again - our company used them often I will pay extra money for adequate service theirs wasn't even that."
2413,0,I recently had a terrible experience trying to sell clothes here I waited in the store for 20 minutes with my items (which were good brands like Splendid Lush Forever 21 etc) and they ended up taking NONE of my items Keep in mind that the store had just opened and there was no one in the store but me and two other customers To wait twenty minutes just to be rudely and quickly rejected was humiliating Also I have no idea why it took 20 minutes The young woman deciding which clothes to take kept leaving the counter for whatever reason It seemed very unprofessional to me She offered me a $5 off coupon for my troubles but that $5 is not worth 20 minutes of my time especially when I have no intention of coming back here I threw the coupon in the trash Buffalo Exchange was not exciting a few years ago and it's certainly not worth anyone's time now If you want to sell clothes take them somewhere less picky like Plato's Closet or more classy like My Sister's Closet.
4016,0,"I went shopping at the Michael's located at 16239 N Scottsdale Rdin Scottsdale Arizona this morning I was looking for a specific craft for my geriatric aunt I walked into the store and thought I had lucked out right away when I saw an associate a few feet away from me I said ""excuse me could I ask for your help"" her response was a BIG sigh with ""ugh"" noise an annoyed look and an extremely sarcastic ""SUUUUURE of COURSE"" and made an overly dramatic show of putting down the items she was holding as if I were bothering her horribly I was totally appalled at her behavior I apologized to her saying I wasn't trying to interrupt her activities but I needed some help finding a specific craft She responded by ROLLING HER EYES at me and asking for the item description At this point I was just trying to get through my interaction with her so I could find the item but her body language and behavior were so hostile I had to stop and I asked her why she was being so rude to me in response she started listing how busy she was I cut her off saying I would find someone else to help me since she was taken with other duties I found a manager (I believe her name was Jen or Jenny) and relayed my difficulties with the previous associate She was somewhat polite but was obviously eager to get the convo over with She was nice enough to listen to my item description and show close examples of what was in stock to me But I was still extremely dissatisfied with the lack of skill when it came to addressing the previous associate's HORRIBLE customer service Jen simply offered an ""I'm sorry"" about the associate's behavior I have been a loyal shopper of Michael's for years and have never had such horrible service I doubt I will be back to this location anytime soon Joann's anyone."

1050,1,"I had never heard of this place but after following my friend to Charlie's one night this foodie friend of mine mentioned that a well-known local chef said this was one of his favorite places to go  With his stamp of approval I immediately jaywalked from the lightrail stop at 7th Ave over to this goofy looking van with a ""CARNE ASADA"" sign in the window  Don't worry - the food is not actually served out of this van of which I had accidentally given my mother the impression There was a small line but the small assembly line of taco-makers are very speedy so the whole experience only took about 15 minutes  We ordered the carne asada tacos which were $1 a piece with everything on them (salsa cabbage and sour cream)  I am always skeptical of hole-in-the-wall Mexican joints as I got deathly ill after (my one and only) trip to Filiberto's but I truly enjoyed these tacos (and my stomach did not reject them yay)  I think they are only open Thursday through Saturday but I am not positive  My boyfriend and I live down the street and went back the other night and had another great experience  There are a couple picnic benches for customers to eat at but as we were not in the mood for this type of atmosphere we took the tacos to-go and they were just as yummy to go."
4323,0,I went to Z PIzza out of convenience It is within walking distance from the ER and the person who was in the ER was irrationally hungry At 6:30 on Sunday night I walked to Z Pizza to get 4 slices of pizza because it was faster than ordering a full pizza The slices were awful They were old They cost $13 They were only barely warmed in the pizza oven If you don't see the pizzas come out of the oven then don't expect them to be good Lesson learned.
3510,0,I have to say after seeing all these positive reviews it makes me even more disappointed that I had just an unpleasant experience My friends and I came here yesterday to grab a quick bite to eat and a few drinks  We came around 3 or 4 in the afternoon so it was very quite  It was our first time so when we walked in we were not sure if it was open seating or what so after being ignored for a few minutes we just decided to have a seat  When we sat down again no one came to greet us or give us menus so we politely asked what appeared to be a host for some menus  This woman was soo rude she didn't even say one word to us all she did was glare back (how dare we bother her for a menu the nerve) until another employee offered to get us some menus and waters  After that my friends and I were already feeling very unwelcomed but still took a look at the menu  Again the same woman walked by our table looked directly at us rolled her eyes shook her head and then darted into some back room (SERIOUSLY is that a joke)  Now at this point I was so upset and our server also  hadn't been back to check on us after several minutes( I'm not exaggerating there was one othe so we just got up and left all together  I can honestly say they have lost my business forever and I will NEVER recommend this place to any of my friends or family Super disappointing  What ever happened to good customer service.

2055,0,Wow So I work at a prison and I've had inmate meals occasionally so there is a certain standard of food and taste that I have developed It's really not that hard to please me with food especially after having prison food but Sam's cafe really questioned whether or not I was an inmate that night I ordered one of their specials which was the pork enchiladas When I got the tray I initially thought they had mistaken the dish for a three rolled tacos with mole-like sauce First I had to decipher if it was fried which was later confirmed Then the sauce on top was definitely something that you cannot label It had a sweet mole yet bitter taste with sour cream that was light and fluffy and made it look like whip cream I know    strange you say The pork was dried out and even the two of us could not finish this one meal that was split The beans tasted hallow if that's even possible and the rice was extra dry I am sorry to give this such a harsh review but it's the truth and sometimes the truth hurts I have to say they do have great margaritas and the best part was the complimentary white chocolate pecan thing they gave at the end Sorry Sam's but this will be my first and last time.
3504,0,"Their website states they are open on weekends pretty much all day So my husband called to get us a reservation because for some absurd reason you need a reservation to use their groupon They didn't answer so he thought they were busy and called back Eventually someone picked up and made him a reservationWe showed up on time and the first thing out of the waitstaff's mouth was ""So are you the guy who called 17 times"" Um I don't think it was 17 times but yeah sure guilty The thing was that the asshole was relentless Embarrassing us in front of the other customers We tried to explain that the website AND the voice mail gave us incorrect information but the guy Paolo still ended up blaming us by saying ""you should have left a voice mail"" and ""Everyone was sleeping and finally someone woke up to answer roe you"" He didn't even apologize and definitely made us feel like we were at fault If he would have taken ownership of the issue it would have been a lot different I could take the first snide comment and let it roll but he wouldn't come off it nor apologize Then we thought hey if they are mad that we woke the cooks up then maybe they'll mess with our food or somethingWe felt so embarrassed and ridiculed and everyone was staring at us so we just left I work hard for my money I'm not going to spend it on assholes when there are so many other delicious restaurants to choose from."
1661,1,This is a wonderful independent establishment in a sea of corporate-bland food  The food is very fresh and quite reasonably priced   I almost always order the pho but the steak salad is just as good on a hot day  Like all great soup bowls you are encouraged to add as much spice basil and lime as you like  Don't let the small size throw you off this place is GREAT.
4204,0,I am honestly shocked by the amazing reviews for this restaurant We read them and went with such high expectations of amazing food and atmosphere Maybe it was our fault we were so let down but we won't make the mistake of going here ever again We walked in to find that it was a complete dive Flies were buzzing about and servers were standing around bored It just seemed so dirty and unkempt Ok maybe the food would blow us awayWe read reviews on the fabulous fresh baked bread so we knew we had to order sandwiches My sandwich was mostly dry shredded iceberg with a blob of mayo dry turkey that looked like it met its fate under a lawnmower Thank god I paid extra for avocado and bacon because those were the only things I could taste at all The bread was so BLAND and plasticky It was just not good And it was beyond expensive for what we got If you have a palate more sophisticated than that of a 4 year old this is not the place for you.

216,1,Don't you just like people that are happy about what they're doing  It's probably because they eat there  If you find your self shopping at the Rack in Chandler this is an excellent meal stop  Order the delicious standards of Pad Thai Pineapple Fried Rice and Satay medium to slightly hot you'll still taste all the wonderful food and that winter cold will just wanna leave :)  Live long and prosper Thai Cafe.
1307,0,I was very disappointed in the customer service that I received from Jiffy Lube  I went in with a coupon for a 2999 oil change and walked out pay $80 for services that were not discussed beforehand  When dealing with mechanic's I've always been skeptical and this place did not change my mind  I am in need of an honest mechanic that isn't required by their employeer to upcharge the customer  I will never return to this place again.
3088,0,The cookies are about the only good thing about this place The service is outrageously bad A friend and I ordered lunch- just some sandwhiches and it took over 30 mins After telling the waitress that we needed to rush things with the check she took even longer forcing us to go to the front of the restaurant to payThe manager is always courteous and thoughtful but his staff is always terrible On the few other occasions I have eaten there my order is always incorrect Huge waste of time if you are looking for a speedy lunch.

4764,0,Had a Reuben Not a Reuben Cole slaw instead of sauerkraut Very little thousand island dressing Marble bread not a strong rye flavor Corned beef was bland too Very very bland I'm from Omaha NE born and raised where the Reuben was invented I'm also Irish This is more of what's called a Rachel Reuben except it sticks with the slightly corned beef instead of pastrami or turkey A Reuben should have a sour and tang stink a bit Disappointed Why they ruined such a beautiful creation is beyond me.
1408,0,Very rude lady on the phone I cannot review how well they repair due to the bad customer service I was never able to schedule an appointment I called to get a quote and she refused unless I had a diagnostic even though I already had one and just needed to know if they have the part and how much it would be to install When I was trying to explain to her my situation she said thank you and hung up on me before I could ask any questions It was so mean and frustrating I figured she could be a little sympathetic to my situation seeing as how my house is 107 degrees and my air has been off for a week but I guess not She did not even ask if I wanted to schedule an appointment.
532,0,I placed a to-go order on a Tuesday night while barley anybody was there & waited 35 minutes to get my food  This was my first time eating their sushi so I was pretty excited and didn't care about the wait  Unfortunately the sushi was oddly warm and the tuna was slimy  For the price I paid (including a 10% gratuity fee for take-out) I expected way better  I felt sick for days even just thinking about how un-fresh the sushi and fish products were  I can't see myself going back just stick to RAor hell even Whole Foods sushi is delicious.

1420,1,A dozen or so cohorts and I gathered for last week's Vikings/Packers game and the service was spectacular We arrived 15 minutes before kickoff and as you can imagine the place was being overun with purple jerseys To accomodate our large party the manager opened up the previously roped off back room and gave us free rein of the joint It seems like the obvious play but you'd be surprised how many bar managers don't see the value in going the extra mile for bigger parties Our table shared a plate of nachos (A-) cheese bread (B+) and soft pretzels (A+) before diving into beer breads (A++) and burgers (B) It's not high brow fare but it is bar food done right As a Minnesotan I'm probably totally biased when it comes to reviewing a Vikings bar but I truly believe that the beer bread and Hop Knot are elite regardless of where you're from Wisconsin goofs included.
138,1,Rather than kitchy this place had pizzaz It has the updated 60's vib down pat Cocktails food and service all thumbs up.
4460,0,The crossroads of bad food and worse service Some of the food was so bad that one taste made you spit it out The rest of the food was cold The server was never to be found We had to get up and search through the restaurant four different times when we needed our server Don't waste your time or money here Your better off eating fast food.
3557,0,Nice customer service but that's it Worst fish and chips I have ever had And their Pete's sauce sucks hard Seriously please don't ever eat here I have stomach ache.
485,1,I LOVE this place I've been here numerous times over the last 7 years and it's great every time.
1035,1,I'm a fan  Saw this place after eating at the restaurant next door  We took some samples but we were stuffed and promised ourselves to come backGlad we did  Everything tastes the way it says  Double Chocolate Brownie  It tastes like chocolate with brownie not overpowering and those little chunks are yummy  Strawberry Cheesecake  Tastes like cheesecake ice cream with swirls of graham cracker crust and chunks of strawberries again so yummy  Mango Orange Coconut Key Lime Pie  it goes on an onThe possiblities are endless and although it seems like a small cup it's the perfect portion size  The price is reasonable for the quality and the serviceWe keep coming back and experimenting with mixing the flavors  A must try.

949,1,We stumbled into this place after finding the doors at The Grind lockedwhat a fantastic surprise Organic and local ingredients a great craft beer selection and an owner/chef who was a delight to chat with We just moved to the neighborhood and having a place like this with some healthy options is a huge plus for us.
4876,0,My fiance and I were out running errands around town this past weekend and passed by this place  I mentioned wanting to try it sometime and that I had been to a place with the same concept many years ago in Tempe and thought it was really cool  After we were done running errands we were headed back the same direction and came up to Ghenghis and he pulled in the parking lot and suggested we go ahead and try it  We walk in and wait to be seated like the sign says right off the bat I notice several employees walk by without even acknowledging us  Then this male employee walks over with a bewildered look on his face like he clearly is not used to seating people  I thought he'd figure it out since it's not exactly a large restaurant  We should have just grabbed a seat at their bar  He told us someone would be right with us and a girl came over and sat usright next to the server station  Whatever I was starving and didn't really care at that time  Neither one of us had been there so our waitress who sat us rapidly explained the process she went thru it so fast I just decided we should fill out their form and have them make our bowls for us  When she got back to us for our order we ordered drinks I got a coke and he ordered a beer  We proceeded to sit there for about 20 minutes meanwhile at the table next to us some people sat down after us and were brought their meals and were almost done  Our waitress comes over and says our food should be out any minute not long after that another woman comes over ( I assume the manager since she wasn't wearing a server uniform) and says that they are out of two of the seafood items that my fiance had ordered  He changed his order and we continued to wait all the while thinking why the hell didn't they tell us that in the first place  Then as we waited and waited some more I started wondering why our waitress said our food should be out soon when they clearly hadn't even started cooking it yet if they didn't even possess the food to cook it  By this point I was extremely hungry and irritated I had half a coke left his beer was empty and the waitress comes by and drops off a fresh coke that I felt like she did only to try and make up for our wait  But maybe she should have thought of asking if my fiance wanted another beer since his was empty  She did stop to ask if they had told us they were out of his order and said she would take our bowls off whatever that meant  We continued to wait a few more minutes until I just couldn't wait any longer  We got up to leave and walked passed the manager lady sitting at a bar table who said thanks for comingya thanks for NOTHING  They weren't even what I would call busy  I have never had to walk out on service like that  I was looking forward to a cool new experience and ended up being extremely disappointed  I will never go there again.
1430,1,If you don't love this place you have problems It's a dive It's delicious The prices are pretty decent It's unique It's delicious It's fun It's delicious Portions are big And it's pretty delicious You can sample a lot of their food before making a selection It's delicious.
3764,0,An adequate downtown motel  Access and proximity are both good  The location appeared to be clean and well-kept  However I'm now reading that they allow pets in guest's rooms making it no more than a fancy kennel  Unless they spray for fleas daily  (they don't) I'm not feeling good about this  Parking is atrocious and the Raddison parking garage (a half-block away) must be used  Service at the front desk was eager to help but only Briana seemed to be able to operate their computer system at check-in  There is only a $9 breakfast buffet here but plenty of nearby places to eat  Elevators are fast in this eight (ten) floor motel  Both water pressure and hot water were extremely good on the 3rd floor sometimes it was impossible to get COLD water  My coworker on the 4th floor had the same observation  Their WiFi (free) never failed but was very slow (below dial-up speeds)  My coworker wisely travels with a CAT5 LAN cable I'll do the same next time  The heating/cooling system does not appear to be aligned with the wall thermostat room temperatures were never right  Although the big screen televisions in each room are low-grade channel selection is extremely good  Our business rate was $13999 ($15857 with taxes) and that is reasonable for this motel  I would come back for a few days at a time when business dictates but this motel wouldn't be my first choice for a week-long stay.

1064,1,C&R Tire is an amazing shop with friendly professional peopleLast night I noticed a screw in my tire I managed to limp home on my donut but knew it would not be safe to drive down the highway to work this morningI found C&R online and noticed they opened at 7 At 6:45 I called and Tracy picked up helping me to find the shop From the get-go she was extremely friendly and I felt like I would be in good handsWhen I arrived they quickly got me up and running in about half an hour The friendly people at C&R even put my donut back in the car and secured all of my parts that I had out when I jacked the car up last night These are great people doing a great job I will be back every time I need work done with the car.
4122,0,"This garish dated murky old place was an absolute ripoff Was looking for a relaxing day and went in fofr a much-overpriced facial Ended up with a treatment you could not PAY me to do I have lost an entire pair of contact lenses from this cuckoo rubbing ""exfoliant"" and two other creams into my eyes had hair ripped out as she gave a ""scalp massage"" with plastic gloves on had ""lip treatment"" jammed into my teeth and then I could not get the woman to leave the room to allow me to dress having had to end the treatment early to avoid the next - and much-dreaded - ""eye treatment"" (She was busy trying to sell me the products) Additionally the ""amenities"" are a gym (which I have a membership elsewhere and nicer) a sauna and a dirty whirlpool I wouldn't soak my feet in let alone my body The bathroom stalls have water damage and it's a good thing they provide flipflops because I wouldn't step foot in the showers without them When I mentioned the facial experience (or lack thereof) to the woman at the desk on the way out she offered me a coupon dor ""half off"" another treatment - which means it would still be only REALLY overpriced Avoid this place Even one of the cheapie chain massage/facial places exceeds this resort - and would be reasonably priced."
4771,0,So bad  Service is always so slow inside  It's like they only care about the drive through and they usually screw that up too I know it's Wendy's so my expectations aren't high but this place still manages to consistently disappoint  Seems like poor managers  Once I had a really nice cashier that was trying hard and even asked for help from other employees when she got backed up but she was told to stop complaining and just go slower  I looked around and saw two other employees flirting with a group of teenagers pretending to clean tables  I could go on with more stories like this but the general trend is slooow bad service with managers who are mean and don't care about customers.
3156,0,Went there recently  have not been to one in AZ  Was mildly surprised by it not being very good  We frequented Applebees a lot in CO because it was close to work  I ordered a chinese chicken salad and it was about a saucer full for nearly 10 dollars My husband had soup and sandwich All you can eat soup came in cup size bowl and sandwich was 1/2  for 8 dollars   Where is the value in that  The waitress was very SLOW to arrive but after that was attentive and very friendly  We both walked out still hungry after an over $2000 check   Wont be going back to Applebees  Would have had a much better lunch at Cheesecake Factory for about the same price.

4498,0,"Please refer to my attached photo for why the Scottsdale Quarter gets ONE star for my review HALF of the entire parking garage was reserved for Valet parking on a Tuesday night at 8:00pm  And all the spots were empty Don't get me wrong I don't mind parking far away and walking or even parking valet but I was just ""stopping in"" to grab some froyo at Menchies The walk to and from my car took longer than it took me to get the Frozen Yogurt  What's the point of having a parking garage if it's completely empty and reserved for valet parking Its no wonder the Oakville Grocery closed there was probably nowhere for the customers to park  I wouldn't be surprised if other businesses close as a result of this horrendous parking situation."

2920,1,This is an update to my previous post  I strayed from Rehab and tried Cold Beer and Cheeseburgers just up the street  MAJOR MISTAKE  It was way over priced crappy food and nothing special as far as ambiance  I actually left Cold Beer and Cheeseburgers and went straight to Rehab for desert I'll never cheat on you again Rehab.
4442,0,I stopped at this KFC/Taco Bell on my way home one time and they were out of most of the KFC menu  The drive-thru cashier was rude and very short with me and offered no options for me when each of the first 3 items I tried to order were already sold out  Not going back.
386,1,Great friendly family owned and operated Always a pleasant experience I like tipping more and often to encourage small business and retar reward great service I love the grilled cheese and rc soda And free refills on same visit.
4726,0,I wish I could give this BBQ place a high grade but I can't  Others have commented on the parking the self-serve experience and the general atmosphere These didn't have an impact on me I was there for good BBQ  When I eat out or at home I expect everything that should be hot (hot with fire not spices) to be HOT and everything that should be cold to be COLD  I ordered pork and beef brisket potato salad cowboy beans  The portions were small but adequate as I am not a big eater  Other might find the portions to small  The potato salad was OK sort of boring The pork was barely warm and the brisket was just warm I should have taken it back to be heated up but didn't The meat tasted OK but nothing to get excited about The cowboy beans were hot and this dish was by far the best cowboy beans I've had in a long time  Doubt I'll go back.

3979,0,"DISHONEST STAFF & TWO SEPARATE BUNGLED HOTEL EXPERIENCESThis was our second visit here as the staff bungled the first visit in July so horribly bad that we were offered to come back and stay again Actually that's not really correct either as when we first stayed there we checked out after only being there for 2 1/2 hours and had paid and not been reimbursed No call back from management They sent an e-mail bot ""how was your stay"" only THEN a manager calls I told him (Robert) my wife wouldn't be interested in returning He pleaded and said that he would personally assure a wonderful experienceWhen I called to book Robert did not return 3 calls that I had made requesting the room Yes 3 calls I then called the front desk asked the gal to book a room with the voucher tells me she has a room with two beds I said that doesn't work for my wife and I She then tells me one king is available but for like $3500 more So yes there was one available they just want to extort some extra $ So I'm thinking ""This place screwed up badly begged us to come back and then wants to nickel and dime me for a king bed"" On that note integrity is very important to me and this hotel has a dishonest staff  If one thing happens well meh 2 things happen its alarming 3 and 4 things happen well I'm pissed off The pool bartender was nice I was given 3 rounds of drinks while seated there and he only charged for 1 Yea I hear folks screaming ""What are you complaining about"" Well it's dishonest and it's stealing I don't like thieves and didn't ask for free drinks nor did I expect them I never walk in to Macy's to buy a shirt and expect the clerk to give me a tie and belt for free do I This experience really sucks because I really really wanted to like this place as I have a liking to mid-century kitschy cool design and this place fits that bill Rooms are retro-eclectic and nice I hurt my back prior to coming here and was rather annoyed that no one told us that there were no elevators so I had to lug luggage up stairs which irritated me I understand it's an older building but staff should have said something prior It is a LONG HAUL  from your room to go get ice I also went to the restaurant to ask for a spoon as my wife had some Ben & Jerrys and the server was rude Otherwise we checked out without incidence - I thought My wife comes to me a couple days later and asks me what the $5000 charge was So I call the hotel to inquire Kristen told me I was charged for a bottle of Belvedere Vodka I assured her that we did not drink it She said it would be refunded I told her I was disturbed that I was charged for this without asking and asked why and she said ""Well obviouslysomebody as in our minibar department went into your room or it was just a mistaken room number or anything could have happened But we'll get it sorted out for you"" I said ""OK Please do"" and guessed that was the end of it  I also wasn't very satisfied with the ""anything could have happened"" explanation To me this is quite sneaky to charge a customer's credit card in this fashion without consent and explanation It's not like they don't have my e-mail and/or phone number to inform me of the charge That's dishonest My guess would also be an integrity issue again with the Hotel Valley Ho staff for missing liquor I was never reimbursed  I call back AGAIN 3 weeks later and Brian said that he would take my name and number and call me back with information The same Brian called me back a half hour later and abruptly asked ""What was the issue"" and in a somewhat curt tone I explained the situation again and told him the charges were supposed to be reversed and weren't He then said in a snarky fashion ""Fine if you didn't take it home with you then I'll reimburse it to your Visa"" At this point I'm really angry as he said it in tone implying that I might be lying about it Nice way to treat your customers Well guess what Yea Brian never reversed the charges Twice they said they would reverse the charges and didn't feels really dishonest at this point It's only $50 bucks but to me it's the principle of the continued dishonesty and then having to spend 20 minutes more on the phone with my bank filing a ""charge dispute"" was time consuming and once again irritating I have much better things to do then waste time with the Hotel Valley Ho's bungling."

3340,0,I have to say I have not been impressed with most of the food I have had at the Biltmore Fashion Park and Stingray Sushi did not disappoint  One of the worst meals and dining experiences I have had at least in regard to sushi  Where do I start  Do I start with the server who helped us at the sushi bar  She took our drink order but unfortunately it never came so we just had water which in the end was a good thing since the food did not have much flavor  I did not think it was that tough to serve up a Coke and a beer but it proved to be a request beyond their ability  From there it went down hill  My two hand rolls were loosely rolled and almost fell apart as I ate them  In addition there was little to no flavor  Then came the 901 roll and that was pretty good though for the money it was not a lot of food  Next my Chilean Sea Bass came and it was definitely overcooked  I could have sent it back but at this point I just wanted to get the meal over with and leave  What followed was the clincher that sealed the deal and allowed me to call this the absolute worst sushi I have ever had  The last roll I had was the spider roll  Anyone who has had a spider roll knows that it is made with soft shell crab  Well my spider roll had plenty of shell but it certainly lacked the crab  I have had lots of soft shell crab made many ways and hands down this was the worst  I could never recommend Stingray Sushi at the Biltmore to anyone unless you have no clue what sushi should be  Eat at your own peril  If you want better sushi than what is served at Stingray just go to your local market  Yes the sushi is that bad there.
1017,0,From the Get go i was depressed when i walked in to the theater first of all its dated and needs some serious upgrading Second when i ordered my pop corn and started to eat it i found it to be cold and stale Then while watching my movie a homeless person snuck into the theater and was annoying First they come in with all their stuff and just throw it al over then they fell asleep and started to snore up a storm When i Told the guest services person they radioed it in and the manager came to wake the person up but they stayed in the theater For the remainder of the movie (15 hrs left) they played with a plastic grocery bag the crinkling noise drove everyone in the theater insane when we told the manager they did nothing about the situation Overall i am deeply saddened that a theater brand I frequent and have come to know as my go to theater has let this theater slip through the cracks.

1695,1,I feel Spanish Fly is one of the best things that has happened in Scottsdale in terms of adult entertainment for quite some time - especially during the hot summer months  In the past if you wanted to go to a pool during the day you would need to get a hotel room at the Valley Ho W etc  Spanish Fly offers: Typically no cover great house music quaint but beautiful grounds and lots of people from all walks of life  just having a good time  I have just as good of a time here at the pool parties as I do at the larger local hotels or Vegas resorts - often even better as it's so convenient  Nights too can be enjoyable but more chill - feels like you're at some small club in the Mediterranean  Can't wait for the summer pool season to start.
4190,0,"After driving by McDowell Mountain Golf Club several times I wanted to play the course It looked fun and like a challenge That and PGA TOUR player Phil Mickelson owns the club I went to book a tee time and their website had tee times listed for $59 I found a tee time on GolfNowcom for $29 so I booked that When I arrived at the course there was no clubhouse That seems to be a trend in Arizona I then asked where the range was and was told I had to pay for practice balls I haven't paid for range balls all year and they wanted $6 for a small bag of balls The range was nice and had nice views but was brown I hoped the course didn't look like this It did The course was in HORRIBLE shape and should not be open I am sure they are getting ready to over seed but if that is the case close the course $10 would be a more acceptable tee time We saw the cart girl before we teed off Didn't see her again all day When we finished and brought that up the guy cleaning clubs said ""Oh yeah she went home"" Apparently she got off at noon because we teed off just before 12:30 I am glad that I played the course but I won't be playing there again The course was in awful shape and the rate was absurd for what we got I would rather play Papago they have green fairways."
4634,0,"Very poor service came during sports hours Staff refused to change it to a station we of our interest They do have 5 TVs  Was actually told ""I am busy""   Beside that the pizza was doughy with a minimal amount of cheese Salad was overpriced and just average and calamari sauce was watery Staff were advised how upset we were after telling them I had a groupon and suddenly tried to be cordial  Left wanting to go to Costco for pizza."
3232,0,"Avoid this location With just one single tux rental I had a plethora of issues Sabrina was the one ""helping"" me with my tux At the time of measurement I was unable to place my deposit because she shut her computer off making me call back 3 times on the three following days just to give my card number for the deposit she lost my measurements had my pickup scheduled an hour away from my original pickup location and after driving all over Arizona I found that she had given the wrong shoe and pant size at pickup I will never be returning to this location and I am skeptical about the local Men's Warehouse locations due to significant lack of both help and any sense of apologetic behavior."

653,1,I went here for a business trip and never wanted to leave It was clean relaxing beautiful Everything I could ever ask for from a hotel.
4666,0,Im going to have to agree Whole heartedly And i informed the manager of it as well I picked this one because it was close to the Airport and the Light Rail The noise from the Airport wasnt to bad But it was the Train Horns all NIGHT LONG and ALL MORNING when your trying to sleep I wouldnt pick this one the neighborhood wasnt bad despite what people say But the Train noise is just unbearable I got it for the Click 6 rate which was reasonable Stay Elsewhere I should of picked one further down that was right off the light rail.
310,0,HORRIBLE My husband and I wanted some good breakfast there were some mixed reviews on this place so we decided to try it I sat down and ordered the Strawberry Waffle and bacon my husband ordered the chopped Steak and eggs My SO-Called strawberry waffle came with NO strawberries and the bacon was thin as paper I asked where my strawberries were to put on the top of my waffle and she said they were inside my waffle MY WAFFLE LOOKED LIKE A BIG STRAWBERRY EGGO BUT FLATTER THAN A PANCAKE To top it off my Husband got his SO-called chop steak and eggsLMAO they brought him a fried HAMBURGER Patty dripping in grease Sent it back left and went to mcdonalds WAFFLE HOUSE MY ASS.
4211,0,"OK so heres the thing These guys got their ""one of the hottest ramen noodle joints in the country yada yada"" nod before they were even open Can you say great marketing team Absolutely and the place is really nice looking but it's NOT good And this is not an ""authentic"" vs not authentic thing as many people have taken one side or the other for I could care less if it was authentic as long as it tasted good which it does not Flavorless greasy over cooked this under cooked that The miso broth pork bowl was the biggest travesty of them all There were 4 of us and there were so many holes in the execution of the dishes that it just felt clumsy andyes had you wishing for a more seasoned team (which may be why many people are screaming for ""authenticity"" by authentic they may just be saying they want something thats goodor at the very least something worth the price tagwhich in this case is a little exorbitant compared to their competition  Base price of most dishes is already on the border and then come the add ons Add Ons which are not add ons in other places that serve ramen Bad form they essentially even charge you extra for flavor Bottom line authentic not authenticI would rather spend my money in a place where the dishes come WITH the flavor included in the price If you can make it down to Ahwatukee Sushi Ken's got some stellar ramen Ramen Republic not too shabby either I would skip this one though There are so many places where you'll be paying for a lot less than an awesome marketing team tells you you should pay for this kind of thing and get a whole lot more."
1285,1,"This place is amazing how have I not been in the entire 6+ years I have lived in the valley This place is very warm and inviting a sharp contrast to the nearby Mill District I went there earlier this week to have dinner with a friend House of Tricks has a great ambiance It's definitely a ""date-night"" sort of place We sat outside on the patio I ordered a Manhatten Iced Tea which ended up not being my cup of tea (no pun intended) but it was a well made drink For an appetizer we ordered the Artisan Cheese & Fruit plate Delicious Fruit and cheese plates always make me feel fancy The presentation was greatit was like a work of art For the main entree I had the Sugar-Spiced Salmon with Chinese Long Beans Mustard Sauce Sweet Soy-Ponzu Sticky Rice and Nori The salmon was probably the best salmon I've ever had It was perfectly seasoned and cooked impeccably The rest of the dish was just as goodoh that sauce It was sweet with just the right amount of spiceOne drawback I have noticed-Thankfully I am now a pescitarian because the vegetarian options are quite limited I'd suggest checking out the website before going :)From the looks of the other reviews I see that the menu is seasonal so I look forward to coming back and trying what else this place has to offer."
3915,0,Very disappointedI had my usual Dirty martini but a friend wanted just a soda since she was drivingDo you know what they charged$400  For a soda  And it was in the smallest glass  Come onWith DUI laws that we have here in Scottsdale and the economy crisis that we are in  $400 for a soda is a bit much when it is cheaper at Target to get a case  ($350) I am not cheap by any stretch but I think it is a bit absurd to over inflate the price of a soda  Don't go to Stone Rose if you are looking for a drink deal.
2432,0,Worst Starbucks I have ever been to FLAT OUT HORRIBLE SERVICE  Took me probably  5-7 just to get a Carmel Frap One person working while the rest were standing around shooting the bullAnd on top of it all I continue to try this place out to see if maybe just one trip here will be quick NOPE The drive thru line is even worse For some reason the customers who go to this particular Starbucks feel like they are special because on top the horrible customer service I have spent countless minutes sitting behind a person who either has the mental capacity of a toddler or who doesn't understand the magical voice contraption to their left(because they take forever to order) THEN these geniuses get up the window they forget to order their favorite little side with their coffee wow SOME OF US DON'T DRIVE A PRIUS Thanks for wasting my gas and time.
1685,0,"I ate here once about a week after it opened and stopped by three other times to sample beer because they had an outrageous tap beer selection for Chandler Service was  how do I put this lets say very unprofessional I met the owner on my second visit and understood why I bet my wife that this place wouldn't last a year She said 13 months to hedge her bet   I have since heard it has shut down and reopened as the ""Watersedge""   Update (1-09)  landlord has locked the doors  Guess the name change didn't help things  Enough said."
4974,0,First off they don't even deliver Wtf Pizza is hands down the worst in surprise Ate there once and that was enough for us Service was horrible Dominos is way better.
1712,1,A drive through that's  open when you're hungry and everything else is closed Score Good food clean facility good service and lots of choices on the menu We eat here a couple times a month and have never been disappointed Love the Carne asada plate and the tortas Yumm.
1892,1,Thuan Kieu is a Vietnamese restaurant that specialize in rice dishes  Although they don't have Pho they do have noodles and vermicelliI think their most famous dish is Broken Rice with (crispy) Bean Curd Skin w/ Shrimp  Needless to say it is very good I ordered a plate with the bean curd shredded pork steam egg and charbroiled meatball and my wife ordered broken rice with grilled pork chop  Both come with nuoc cham dipping sauce  I've never been impressed with other restaurant's shredded pork (too dry) and steam egg (dry & hard) but Thuan Kieu managed to exceed my expectationThe shredded pork is soft same with the steamed egg (without being soggy)  The charbroiled meatball and pork chop are also very goodWe also ordered Nem Nuong Nha Trang  They are spring rolls with charbroiled meatballs crispy eggroll skins and a bunch of veggies  I have to say they are the best in the valley I can just eat these for lunch (they come in a set of four)  If you want better Nem Nuong you will have to go to Brodard in LA Little Saigon I highly recommend this Vietnamese restaurant  Their rice dishes are top notch  Don't forget to bring some cash since they are a cash only restaurant.
2475,1,Love the tea here I come quite often and suggest others do the same :).
963,1,"This place is AMAZINGLesson learned: arrive early  Call ahead and place an order  Get on the mailing listThere is nothing better than getting your meat from and English butcher  I recently read that you should develop a good relationship with your butcher  They know the meat inside and out and can give you the best tips when in comes to preparing or ordering  This is that kind of place  And it's only about 7 minutes from my houseWe left with grass fed ground beef grass fed patties rashers bacon (pork belly bacon yum) 3 tbone steaks and a hunk of beef for roast beefWe didn't find exactly what we were looking for because they were out and it was mid afternoon on a Saturday  Their advice was the above ""lesson learned""This is the only place we'll be getting our meat from now on  What's better than your very own grass fed butcher  I can't think of much :)."
4661,0,This is a nice enough hotel and extremely convenient to a number of bars and restaurants - walking distance for many The rooms are clean and comfortable but the decor is fairly dated There are minimal food/drink options on the property itself but the limited poolside menu wasn't bad However and the reason for the one star is the horde of pre-teen boys staying here for a baseball tournament They pretty much terrorized the place all weekend and their parents/guardians did nothing to contain them We had a room close to the pool and could hear them screaming all afternoon - even inside with the AC on Other friends had a room near a large grassy area and they were playing outside their room all afternoon  more screaming We left and went to Blanco's for a drink While we loved the location not sure we'd come back if this is who they cater to.
1250,1,I've been going to Spring Training games here for close to ten years now and this place is really the closest you can get to a Wrigley experience in the southwest - part sports bar part stadium all fun Make sure you get an Old Style from Mark the Beer Guy (he can usually be found around home plate on the mezzanine) As a rule I avoid the concession stand hot dogs in favor of a Vienna Beef cart serving up Chicago style dogs but we've all had those before So if you're feeling adventurous try the pork tenderloin sandwiches from the trailer behind the left field bleachers Not good for you but good Ridiculously good Perfectly breaded and deep fried A true testament to the greatness that is Iowan porkOh yeah and there's some baseball being played too.
870,1,"I freaking love The Good Egg It's a great straight up no frills breakfast place It almost reminds me of the diners back home in NY You can pretty much get eggs any way you want them along with all sorts of other breakfast goodies (They have inventive/creative options)  In my experience the service has been great and the food is inexpensive I wish there was a place like this in Boston but alas I will just keep pining away for it until I move And the 6th free entree ""Best Thing In Life"" card is sweet."
3888,0,Words cannot even express how much I hate this place It's literally five minutes from my house in Tempe and everybody and their mother loves it here I've been here four times FOUR CHANCES and they blew every single oneVisit 
3763,0,"Once was enough Everyone was raving so we tried it He had breakfast and said ""meh"" and mentioned that he couldn't tell what kind of grease the eggs had been cooked in But no big deal However I had something called that if I recall was a sirloin salad-the name escape me It was advertised as a garden salad tossed with sliced grilled sirloin The waitress tried to warn me against the dressing it comes with offering me a choice of another--I should have taken her up on I think they got the dressing they used in a hunting shop-think something that might attract a bear or something The meat was a far from sirloin as it could have been I couldn't cut it I couldn't chew it I have no idea what it was Never again."
1498,1,After many hours of traveling to get from NYC to Arizona I was exhausted and starving All I had eaten all day was some crackers and it was the equivalent of past dinner time on the East Coast I was so happy when my family suggested we venture over to Sweet TomatoesFor those not familiar with the place this place has the largest salad bar you have ever seen It is literally the length of an entire NYC Avenue I always take 2 plates for the salad bar as I really don't like my food to touch They have excellent pre-made caesar salads asian chicken salads and joans brocoli I even tried a pineapple coconut cole slaw this time which was quite tastyI enjoyed making my own salad of lettuce cucumbers carrots raisins pasta hard boiled eggs and asian noodles They also have the best zesty italian dressing ever Afterwards you have choices of soups potatoes pastas and pizzas I had a sweet potato with honey butter It was the softest sweet potato and so sweet I have no idea how they cook it to such perfection The macaroni and cheese is also nice and creamyFor desert they have soft serve yogurt machines I had vanilla with caramel syrup The wait staff that comes to clear your plates is always super friendly and brings you fresh baked chocolate chip cookies I cant see how anyone could not love this place and I hope to come back at least 1 more time before my trip ends
1824,1,This place is great I have had a few pedicures in my time and this one is the best I'm a stickler for the calf/lower leg massage They added a hot stone to it which made the whole experience I might have to come back on my own terms and not with my wife Great place to go.
455,1,Great wine great ambiance amazing music.
165,1,This was my first trip here after having look around for good southern food I'm a fried catfish fanatic and I came especially to try it out and it was some of the best I've eaten I got the 3 piece catfish with 4 shrimp meal with fried okra I opted for the spicy version and it was just the right amount of spice Not too hot but just enough to taste  Lightly battered with cornmeal and amazingly good The shrimp were good but nothing compared to the fish and okra  Now for the okraOMGlightly battered with great mix of seasoning made this some of the best I've had Portions are largeI had one piece of fish leftover There is also a lot of BBQ dishes and countless other options and sides The guy who took our order which I'm assuming would have been the owner was super friendly and very enthusiastic about food Very reasonable prices with a casual atmosphere A great little find and I will definitely visit here many times in the future.
172,0,"If you don't want to read through my drama just beware to DOUBLE CHECK your order if you come here  The food is fine - like any other MacDonald's - but they have a tendency of getting orders wrong  for me anyway and no I do not ask for any kind of unreasonable custom orderI am putting my grievance here because the managers there just don't seem to care  On several occasions this particular Micky D's has gotten my order wrong  A nuisance at first but I was willing to let it go one time  two times  three times About a month ago I'd already lost track how many times they have gotten our order wrong  I didn't have a receipt but I did call the manager because I wanted to let them know they should work on training employees about reviewing orders  It has happened one too many times for me not to speak up  She was apologetic and even tried to rectify the situation ""Come by next time and I'll still let you get your order for free  Tell them Corrinda said it was ok""  I was like ""Whoa that was awfully generous"" and thanked herA couple of weeks later I had to take my daughter to the ER for a scorpion bite  This Micky D's is barely a block away so I sent the husband to get our dinner  ""They forgot my McNuggets""  Well this stressed out mamma with a screaming baby in the ER with the worst pain that anyone could possibly imagine was not going to take this sitting downI drove back to the Micky D's with our order and receipt and asked to see the manager  I told her about our most recent experience in addition to the missing McNuggets  She was apologetic saying her minimal obligatory apology and sent me on my way  She said something about just starting but that got me even more pissed off that she was defending getting orders wrong  There's no excuse  Don't even get me started on the fact that she hardly spoke English which I believe may have contributed to her reticent behavior  Come on now at the managerial level communication with customers is pretty vital I would thinkI left flabbergasted that my money wasn't refunded - not even that it wasn't refunded but it wasn't even offered -  but I knew I had to take a breather because my daughter needed a mamma who was calm and collected  No point in getting steaming mad  ""You got your nuggets so just let it go"" I told myself  The next day I decided to get our ""free breakfast"" because it was a hellish night before to get up early and make breakfast for everyone  When I dropped Corrinda's name to the cashier and how she was going to comp my next order she asked for a receipt I said I didn't have one and she was going to ask the manager what to do  A minute later she came back and told me they couldn't give me the breakfast for free if there was no receipt  I told her get the manager out here so I can explain  She goes to the back again and comes back out a couple minutes later and says that the manager approved  Again I wonder if this is a training issue because i would have expected for this  manager to come out and talk to meThe restaurant itself is nice and there is a playground  The food is fine - tastes like MacDonald's  I will be coming here as little as possible for the sole fact that my orders have been incorrect on so many occasions that I've lost count  The manager's don't seem to have a good handle on training their employees and the managers themselves don't seem to know how to handle customer issues."
1487,0,Purchased a Groupon deal for Fuego Del Mar while in Phoenix for this weekend but ended up here per the owner's suggestion as Del Mar is closed for a wedding reception The host is pleasant but our server is snooty and the taste of their food do not justify their pricing We're from CA and dined at places that charges this much but tasted way better than this We were in Albuquerque (El Pinto) and Santa Fe (Taberna La Boca) the weekend before and had excellent food but didn't pay this much.
1434,1,"Came for the amazing brunchWhat I love about their brunch is the options  For $33 you can get their buffet brunch which includes the better than usual goodies: omelet station crab legs already peeled shrimp lox fresh fruit warm breads various salads waffles grilled veggies and a dessert bar  Now to mix it up they also offer delicious items off their menu  These dishes range from $10 - $15 a plate but are fantastic and large  However if you want to then add the brunch buffet to your menu selection you can pay an additional $23  So in essence you can get the $10 pancakes and the $23 buffet and pay the same price as getting the stand alone buffet  I got the banana-pecan French toast off the menu  OMG it was perfect - especially with the warm ""real"" maple syrup  Service there is great and very attention driven  Even my napkin would be neatly folded by the time I returned to my seatWe came for a birthday and they had inscribed a nice note on top of the piece of dessert  A very nice touchI also love the ambiance and the grounds of the Royal Palms property  It's gorgeous there."
1566,0,"I don't get these reviews For $816 I got two nice-sized cupcakes made from cake mixes For that price I expect to get home-made cakes from quality ""scratch"" ingredients For $816 I could buy a couple of cake mixes and frosting ingredients and make about 30 cupcakes And don't say buttercream frosting when it's made from crisco (sweetex) Yuck Where have all the tastebuds gone."
2013,0,The service was appalling They left us on the back patio and forgot about us  When something was said they didn't seem to care  We left and went to Phoenix City Grill.
503,1,OMG seriously the best Carne Asada burrito I have ever ordered at a neighborhood Mexican food drive thru style restaurant  The meat is tender and not fatty and the burrito is not greasy and heavy  The portions are more than enough  The breakfast burritos are also awesome  In all honesty a $400 breakfast burrito will feed my husband and I  So if you are not big eater you can definitely share.
2507,1,"I love the pizzas here The crust is positively delicious I never get that nasty crash I do from other pizzas The Superbiotic on skinny crust is my favorite The staff here is always friendly and they have me coming back atleast 2-3 times a week I've had delivery too and they're always prompt Like they say when they answer the phone ""It's a great day to get Naked""."
863,0,"So I'd like to start by first saying that I did NOT use Safelite but was so appalled on the phone that I would never even think about it I called the main number on their Web site to get information and I was connected to some inbound call representative Firstly they wouldn't give me a quote until they asked me a lot of questions many of which had nothing to do with what the chip repair would cost Secondly they tried to say it would cost $10100 for a chip repair I was so shocked because I once replaced an entire windshield for $11000 so I would never spend that much for a repair I told her that it was outrageous and nevermind then she said ""Ok I can do $7500"" I told her too high and no thank you so then I had to hear a lecture about how their apoxy is clear and such great quality and on and on I called a few other companies and am very happy that I can go with Guardian Auto Glass who will come to my house for $4495 + tax."

4090,0,"I was looking for a good idea for breakfast in my South Scottsdale neighborhood and just could not pass by the 27 good reviews of US Egg in good conscience without relaying my very different experience - one of the worst restaurant experiences I've ever had I usually like US Egg but had never been to this location until about 6-8 weeks ago A friend and I were running around doing errands and decided to stop for a quick bite what turned out to be about 13 minutes before closing We asked if they were still serving the answer from the host was yes of course and were shown to our table I made a quick run to the ladies' room while my friend ordered coffee and got menus And it was when I returned to the table that things began their nose-dive  Evidently our waitress had dropped off the menus and told my friend that we needed to hurry and order and actually expressed annoyance that I was in the ladies room Hmm At this point I gave US Egg the benefit of the doubt People don't actually say things like that But when the waitress came to take our order she was clearly annoyed So much so I asked if it was too late to get a meal told her we'd asked at the door when we arrived She said we'd have to hurry but they were still open I chalked it up to her being tired at the end of her work day We ordered immediately and breakfast arrived quickly The food was a disaster: coffee was cold the eggs were not cooked the veggies were not edible the hollandaise was out of a can or other container and had been microwaved or something still retaining the shape of the container (read not warmed enough) Just thinking about it now makes me shudder Honestly I could not eat it I tried We were hungry While we ""ate"" someone came over to our area and mopped the floor with some very strong smelling cleaning solution OMG There was no one else sitting around us We did not get coffee refills The waitress left the building And we had to flag someone else down who was clearly annoyed to have to bring coffee and the bill She saw that we had not eaten and offered a container but we declined A good opportunity to point out the raw broccoli and jellied hollandaise and said we did not want to take it with us it was not a good meal at all and we'd wished that they had simply told us no they could not serve us at the door She shrugged  The host/manager sat at a table near the door reading one of the free newspapers from the rack near the door appearing to be killing time waiting to close unaware of what was happening We did not complain The problem was with multiple personnel including him No one - host two waitresses cook(s) and floor clean-up guy took any pride in their work or showed any sign of ""welcoming"" us into their establishment Instead of being so rude and wasting our time and thiers they should have politely asked us to come back another time when we came in the door That would have been fine  We could not wait to get out of there I left a minimal tip (I was not going to let them decide my response to their bad behavior) I paused at the door looking back at our table I was amazed to see that there were at least 3 other tables of people eating so we were certainly not the last lingering guests The manager never even looked up from his reading and we walked right by him On the way to the car I swore to myself that I'd find and write a letter to the *owner* but never did More wasted time We were just never going back Ugh This was one of the most ""inhospitable"" hospitality experiences I've ever had I fully expected the restaurant to be closed by now And instead I see positive reviews Bewildering."
2293,1,I have been coming to Olive & Ivy for almost two years now I bring family and friends here from out of town The food is consistently fantastic and you can't beat that free bread with the pesto I took my mom brother grandma and 2yr old daughter yesterday for lunch We started with the Tuna Tar Tar Tacos My mother and brother LOVED them My daughter ate at least two big pieces of bread and tore up the pesto How many 2yr olds are eating pesto really The general consensus was that they loved the food and wished I would've brought them when they first got into town I ordered my favorite chicken panini w/fries It's just too good to get anything else Don't get me wrong I still take a taste of everyone else's food so I know what to recommend to my future guests That panini with the cheese zucchini roasted tomatoes roasted chickenmmmmmmmmmso good They also have great fries sorry to say but second to Gordon Biersch Brewery'sOlive & Ivy never lets me down Great location great seating whether inside or outside Can't wait to go back.
2030,0,Hmmm Bait and switch Got a flier from a representative from this place and they won't honor their advertisement It's says that you get a custom pizza and salad made from scratch all at a respectful price of 775 I thought that was a great deal until I called and the guy who answered said it was either or not for both Sucks because I heard that their pizza is not bad but I'm not going to spend my hard earned money at a place that won't honor their mistakes Good luck Fired Pie.
2995,0,DISLIKENormally I fly southwest - for some odd reason US airways this past time was the better deal NEVER AGAINI like to consider myself not much of a complainer (see other reviews) but my flight out of PHX to LAS VEGAS was horrendousAllow me to clarify Not the flight itself but the plane I might as well have been on a private jet I think if I stretched my body from fingertips to toes I would make up the width of the plane I'm 5'1 Another down side was that they charge for checked baggage - needless to say I was not going to pay the extra fee and thus consolidated all my belongings into a small 'approved' suitcase only to come to find out that it wouldn't fit in the overhead storage Again - terrible Again - reference to the size.
3998,0,First of all i would never ever  travel with grey hound never again because the buses are never clean There always trash on the bus its disgusting I was on my to Perris CA to visit my dad taking the bus on the way there was horrible the  diver was a jerk  Then on the way back to Phoenix AZ very bad experience so i pay for my daughter ticket for her own seat because she 6 years old this bus was pack some people had all there seats the diver did not said nothing but this one guy move his stuff out the way but it was only one seat so my daughter had to sit on my lap i was very mad i did not pay for my child to sit on my lap now we are all most there to Az thats when the bus diver finally did something there was a heelchiar on the bus diver he tough he can pull out some seat justva little bit ugh it was a very tight squeeze never never again then what make things worse their customers service is really ridiculous i told them i want my money back they told me they can only give me two options you can credit to your next trip or $25 cash back hell no like i said never again.
4578,0,"As much as I am a lover of all W's due to the trendy scene the touch of details and the unique style to a hotel stay I have to say that the W Scottsdale does provide all of this BUT the rudeness of the staff takes away from all the positives I stayed there in May this past year and had a bad experience with staff- I recall saying to myself ""Well never going back there again"" Well like any loyal person I gave it a go again when they were having their Phoenix Suns GalaI encountered the same rude staff and they even seemed to get more rude I will always be a fan of W's but I will never return to this one."
3767,0,Unfortunately I have to update my review to one star Since our last experience we have tried to come back to Epiq on more than one occasion to no avail They are now charging $20 on Fridays AND Saturdays even to womenThe last time I talked to the bouncers was the final attempt I'd ever make It was 12:45am on a Friday night and they refused to drop the cover charge You want each one of my girlfriends (7 of us total) to pay $20 for only one hour of entertainment I even asked them to reduce it to $10 and they said noSo I vowed not to ever go back and went to Dollhouse instead The lovely VIP host comped us a bottle and a round of shots so that's where my 5 stars my girls and my money are going.

465,1,We went to Daily Dose on a Saturday June 23 about 10am  when we got there the line seemed endless but the hostess told us it would be a 15 minute wait and she was right on We sat at the bar which was great service Food is amazing I had the chorizo eggs Benedict while my husband had the meat omelet with smoked Gouda both were amazingly tasty  have a mimosa make it a double and it's a perfect breakfast   Hostess also took the time to come talk and see how we were doing Really enjoyed it We will definitely be back to try lunch or dinner next time.
306,1,I can't say enough about this storage center I was moving from Arizona to Eugene Oregon with my sons We had so much to do in a short amount of timeWe needed to store some items while we emptied out our house The manager Priscilla was wonderful to work with She helped us in every way she could Five stars for Five star service from start to finish If you need storage this is the place to go.
2427,1,My husband and I love to go to family owned places So we stopped in and we were greeted right away The staff is very friendly and attentive The food is great so needless to say we dine her at least once a week Food is very good nice vereity to pick from the menu and wines.
1341,0,"If I could rate zero stars I would This is the first time Yelp has failed us dearly Awful service (the headchef sat us) and the menu isn't even close to what is actually served When we finally got our appetizer ""heirloom tomatoes"" really meant hothouse tomatoes When the soup showed up about 30 minutes later it good the salad was not Fast forward another 45 minutes when dinner arrives: what I expected to be something along the lines of chicken scampi arrives as chicken parmesan on a bed of spaghetti and tasted like cardboard smothered in tomato paste I'm not one to rate low by any means but both Yelp and Verona failed us this evening The only thing worth coming for was the wine I hope Sunday brunch is better but after this scouting event chances are I'm not going to find out."
2266,1,i always forget about this place when we do a party they carry costumes and party gear year roundeven halloween stuff stopped in today to look for a flintstones costume but they had no Fred's and the wilma they had for 50 bucks we bought on-line for 30 bucks i had an online coupon for 15 bucks so i only bought house decor for halloween but if you need any kind of prop for a costume/theme party bike pub ride or just feel like dressing up this place is perfect.
4103,0,Never written a review on yelp and this is my first Absolutely the worst experience I've ever had at an auto establishment I go to the Fletchers off Lake Pleasant and Happy valley frequently This is the first time I've gone to this Fletchers I cannot express to you strongly enough to stay as far away it from this place as you can Rude inconsiderate and unprofessional.
2109,1,Thank you Ocean Air came highly recommended and now I know why Excellent fast friendly service Reasonably price AC maintenance and FAST response if there is a problem.
4860,0,"This was by far the worst experience I've ever had at a restaurant in my entire life I wish I could say I am exaggerating but this really topped every bad experience I've ever had in the past The entire experience was bad from beginning to end We came in for a Thanksgiving meal and the hour we endured ruined the entire holidayThe service here was beyond terrible We were 1 of 3 tables being served so it wasn't busy at all - but we were treated like they had a full house and a line of people waiting out the door It all began when we weren't greeted The woman hurriedly walked up to us and looked at us as if we came in to ask a question I said ""two please"" and she replied ""two what"" I repeated myself ""Two for here please"" And then the fun beganIt took us about 10 minutes to even be acknowledged by the waiter/owner When we asked for a coke and diet coke he angrily took our teacups away and returned with our sodas about 10 minutes later I'm not sure what we did to tick him off but he sure was upset that we came inWhen we inquired about the price of crab he told us ""Ummmm ummmmmmmmm $4500 Some are bigger some are smaller"" and very quickly walked away said something to the lady working there and walked in the back Finally he came back and took our order We ordered in Chinese he confirmed it in EnglishThe food certainly didn't take long to arrive - so much so that the paper wrapped chicken was still partially raw in the center and the peppered beef was uncooked halfway through The dishes themselves were presentable but very very small and pricey for a typical Chinese joint We never complained about the raw food The owner added an additional dish about 5 minutes after we began to eat He became very upset with us when we told them we didn't order it and asked him to take it back We weren't rude about the mistake with the additional dish but he quickly got an attitude with us and began to argue with us about the dish and wanted us to take responsibility for it He refused to serve us the for remainder of the meal and had the other lady working there give us our check We certainly won't be returning and I hope that anyone else who braves this establishment has a better experience than we did."
3670,0,"The food here might be good I don't know we weren't allowed to stay I showed up with my family of 5 at 8:30 We walked to the counter where the girl informed us they were only serving orders to go I said ""the sign says you're open 'till 9"" She said that yes they were but once our food came out it would only leave us about 5 minutes to eat So wait let me get this straightFirst it takes 25 mins to make a few teriyaki bowlsSecond as far as I know if we enter an establishment during hours of operation we should be able to sit down and eatThird you want me to take my family of 5 including a 3 year old and a baby outside to eat in the car so you can close your doors at 9 on the dotGive me a break."
1612,1,The look and feel of this place is amazing you have yo check it out With good prices on drinks and a hot friendly staff how can you go wrong.
1201,1,We don't like to repeat restaurants on vacation but we visited this restaurant on our spring training vacation this year and last year Their small burgers are great size so u can have 2 and experience more flavors Sweet tots and smothered tots are great and we haven't found a bad sandwich Wild boar wagu chicken quinoa and the pb&j are all our favorites I cannot believe how delicious the pb&j is Highly recommend trying different burger types in one visit hereAll sides are a la cart and sandwiches are smaller but if you're looking for something unique and different this is a sure stop  Prices may be considered high but when you try the food it's understandable  Happy Hour is early if you want the cheaper prices.
506,1,Stephanie is amazing She is my go to person in Arizona Her skills and attention to detail amaze me On top of it she is very friendly and down to earth Very knowledgeable in her field Plus if you have ANY questions about application etc she is so helping at teaching and explaining I cannot stress enough how much I have enjoyed having Stephanie do my makeup I will definitely continue to use her every chance I get.
1076,0,Ordered the Carnitas burrito as well as the steak burrito I also ordrered the cheese quesadillas with chickenThe pork was WAY TOO SALTY  I couldn't finish it without drinking a tonFigured that it was a fluke from a heavy-handed cook with that one particular burrito so dug into the steak and found it to be just as as salty What a disappointmentThe quesadillas were not badHowever with how salty the two  burritos were I can not recommend Desert Springs.
3500,0,"I have been craving Boba since I had an avocado one last month in Berkeley (it sounds disgusting but for some reason that I can't quite figure out it is delicious)  Anyways I remembered that there was a Boba place on Mill when I got back into town  The first time that I tried to go there the rude ""cooler than you"" crusty punk girl behind the counter shut me down  They were out of boba and it seemed like she wanted to shoo me out the door since I had inadvertently cut her smoke break short I left and came back a couple days later only to find out that they had closed early  A few days after that I came back again and the same annoying crusty punk girl seemed put off that when she had to actually get up and make a drink for me  The drink was delicious  I figured that I could put up with the attitude of what apparently is this shop's only employee  Once again I went there and dealt with the same standoffish crusty  Once again the drink was delicious although she apparently didn't want to spend the time to blend it fully so there were huge chunks of ice in the bottom of the cup  Anyway this place sucks and it sucks bad except for the drinks  I really don't want to support this place ever again but I might be forced to if a cannot find another equally delicious boba drink."
1313,1,We love this place The food is very good with large portions and the prices reasonable We go there at least once a week The taco salad is great My husband says the tacos are very good and the cheese crisp was the best he's ever had.
4102,0,"Really if I could I would give this place zero stars because it is a disgrace If you need an emergency vet in the Scottsdale/Paradise Valley area go to Sonora Veterinary Specialists on Cactus/40th St(http://wwwsonoraveterinaryspecialistscom/) It's also 24/7 but unlike VCA PVEAH it is a truly valuable legitimate facility and it''s staffed by engaged committed deeply caring and extremely knowledgeable and skilled personnel At SVS you and your pet are treated well and what you pay is fair and justifiedVCA is the opposite of SVS in every single way VCA is in fact the WORST of corporate animal service providers The space is small cheap cramped and the staff are indifferent at best and don't convey any genuine love of or concern about animals in pain or distress All they want is your money They do NOTHING for the $9975 they charge for an ""emergency exam"" We essentially paid that amount just to be given an astronomical estimate literally nothing more--our dog was the exact same bloody traumatized mess we gave to them when they gave him back--after making us wait nearly an hour without ANY communication)  Furthermore they tack on bogus surcharges ($525 for a ""biohazard waste fee"") that are irrelevant to the ""service"" provided and their drug prices are absurd--$8 for a single Tramadol tablet anyoneConversely our (and our dog's) experience at Sonora Veterinary Specialists was wonderful (even in the context of an emergency) and the cost was ultimately significantly lessVCA is a money-grubbing depressing sham."

677,0,"Great place to go in a stressful situation if you'd like to blow a couple grand and still not get a diagnosisI took my then 14-year old cat to this clinic last year on a Sunday with uncontrollable vomiting  She's an indoor cat with no history of ingesting foreign bodies  The initial vet I spoke to x-rayed her and performed blood tests which came up negative  She was admitted for ""overnight observation"" on a Sunday morning as her vet was not available until Monday  I was awakened by a 4 am phone call from another vet advising she needed ""emergency"" surgery that would cost $3500  Why  He didn't know but stated since her vomiting was not responding well to medication it was best to do the exploratory to look for this mysterious foreign body  I insisted she at least wait a few hours until she could get an ultrasound at the adjacent clinic when they opened  The ultrasound showed no indication of a foreign body or any other internal problemsLater that morning my own vet examined her and made an instant diagnosis of an allergic reaction to her new thyroid medication   And yes I had advised the emergency clinic of the medication the dosage and the length of time the cat had taken it when I arrived  She made a full recovery once back in the care of her regular doctor  Had I not trusted my own instincts I might have been influenced by the ""expert"" recommending this geriatric cat be operated on with no clinical indications However don't be concerned about unauthorized medical treatment  You are expected to pay for every test and treatment BEFORE they will do it  I do give this clinic one star as the cat did manage to survive."
1259,1,This is the pizza that California Pizza Kitchen wishes it could be like:  Organic natural and free-range products that are fresh flavorful and are balanced perfectly with the other ingredients on your pizza  The crust is just right-perfectly crispy  I tried a Margherita pizza and the chicken artichoke  The chicken artichoke was delicious with lots of toppings huge chunks of artichoke and very flavorful chicken  Since they use free-range chicken you can definitely tell the difference in taste vs a regular mass-farmed chicken  Service was excellent as well  Despite being very busy our drinks were constantly attended to and refilled as needed  I will definitely be going here again for more pizza and to try out some wingsPS  If you get an appetizer I highly recommend the brie and roasted garlic plate  So delicious.
406,0,I got food here twice  I rarely eat fast food but have a soft spot for egg mcmuffins they don't seem THAT bad for you and are filling  The first time the English muffin part of it was just about burnt to a crisp and inedible (leaving me hungry until lunch)  The second time it was barely toasted and the cheese was cold (giving it a much much much less desirable flavor)  This mixed with kinda rude staff (for those I've dealt with) on both occasions and I'm not going to make the same mistake a third time.
1037,1,I will keep this simple the food is good and the price is rightI eat here to often and have probably shortened my life expectancy (it isn't the healthiest choice in town).
2112,1,Secretos is our favorite to come to when we're here in Phoenix The food is amazing We love the booths and the service and hospitality  are first class.
2953,1,Always forget about this place cuz its so far from the food court  Great food atmosphere & fast service  If you want to relax with your $10 salad away from the food court chaos come here  Also Ron Goldman's dad with the mustache from the OJ trial works in the men's suit dept just leave him aloneunless you want to buy a nice suit of course.
2562,1,This is as good as it gets when it comes to hot and cold sandwhiches Chips a toasted sandwhich and your set to run out the door If you're ever downtown check this out Only m-f though.
1288,1,I eat here weekly  At this pace I will be as big as five guysBut I can't help it  Big juicy burger double stacked topped just the way I like it and served with enough cajun fries for three guys this place makes the food I like  It's a man meal fit for a trucker   It'd take five guys just to keep me out of this joint.
2780,1,Added bonus: Get the scones early (before 7am) and they are still warm Yummm.
1934,0,My review is not kind the doctors are fine however the cost issue for me has been a nightmare I only have a 1000 dollar a month social security check with no other income and no insurance at this time I am a cancer patience in remission always in need of follow up xrays however I am doing reasonabley well However it was discovered that I have a heart issue and require a ct scan I bearly could scrape up the 10000 dollar co-pay for the surgeon For this ct scan it requires 29000 dollars that I could not come up with I offered the DMG services half and ask if I could pay the other half when I received my next check For the second time a clerk simply told me that if I could not come up with the money I could not have the test I requested to talk with a supervisor and was denied and was told the policy will simply hold I brought to the attention of this clerk my health issues and the concern of the heart surgeon she said it simply does not matter  To make things worse DMG services has missed billed me more than once I paid them last time 15000 dollars for a service and have the receipt and they could not account as to where it went The same clerk finally had to conceid and correct the bill for the second time I have on file eight times where I made a co-payment to doctors and was sent a bill wanting me to pay for it again Just two days ago I went through the same thing over to bills I sent copies of my receipts for them to correct the issuesI am 63 years old no other income not married and I have a clerk making a decision about my life with no accountability I can only assume that Maricopa county has a kill zone I noticed they have a refugee area those individuals seem to be doing quite well of coarse younger I would like to apply for refugee status.
340,0,Was with a group of 9 slow serviceit was croweded and the waitress hardly saw our table  People just ordered mutlipe drinks at a time anticipating slow serviceOrdered the most expensive thing on the menu the rib-eye  Worst piece of meat I've ever had  One half was cooked rare the other half was mediumwith more fat on it then meat  Waitress asked me to be honest about how it was and I said ok and that was the end of itthanks  Never again.
410,0,The service level and attitude of the staff was diabolical they demonstrated absolutely no interest in our business Ever since moving to the new premises things have sucked I shall not be wasting any more of my time or money here.
1242,1,As someone who loves sushi rice but not the raw fish that usually accompanies it this place is perfect When we came in the manager described it as the Chipotle of sushi and with the affordable prices of PeiWei While I thought it was kind of strange to describe this place in terms of nearby restaurants it really is an accurate description  The rolls are a decent size and quite filling I'm a big guy but two rolls filled me up easily  I got a brown rice mango cucumber and asparagus roll and a white rice avocado spinach and tofu skin roll Both were delicious and only $4 each for 10 pieces  This place is my new favorite place in all of Phoenix Can't wait to go back.
3866,0,Oh Upper Deck Let me count the ways in which you are lame:- You have a $25 minimum for credit cards Ayesha assures me that this is a standard thing yet I've lived in the quintessential college town for 15 years and I've never even heard of anything so egregious I mean we drank well over $25 but still lame- A server never even looked at us Not once- Your clever little 'Balls to the Wall' mural has a hockey puck in it  Puck not ball- Your food appears to be from large industrial size bags that sit frozen until the need to deep fry/microwave them arises  Keep in mind I have almost zero standards for food- And honestly I drug my girlfriend here because it is supposedly a 'Michigan' bar and we were going to watch Michigan basketball  I was willing to overlook just about anything - I just wanted to watch them play with like minded fans  But seriously its 2009 and you DON'T HAVE HD You are a sports bar  HD was practically created for you  OK Michigan won and they played the fight song over the speakers in the bar that was cool and I was happy for it being so far from home that's worth one star But under normal circumstances why anyone would ever come here to watch sports is completely beyond me.
3624,0,Much to our chagrin this location is now CLOSED Drove from SE Gilbert for chili omelette so disappointedAt least the other locations are apparently staying open Guess we'll have to go to Tempe next time we have a craving.
864,0,I took my father here for dinner because I had heard so many good things about it The restaurant was relatively slow when we arrived We were sat by a very friendly hostess and waters were promptly delivered Then we sat at our table for over 15 minutes without receiving any further service I had to ask the hostess to find our waitress for us  Once they finally came over and took our order they hardly seemed apologetic for the neglect In addition to having to wait so long to even place our order they forgot my order when the food finally arrived I will not take anything away from the quality of their food but the service is less than up to standard Id recommend getting take out.
4735,0,Please don't waste your time or money Ate here twice years apart and got food poisoning both times Horrible just horrible Save yourself.
4819,0,it is ok it is pretty much the only place around here where you can have pupusas my biggest complain is that i went to their website and try to use their coupons but when i called to verify my order they told me that the prices changed how about change your website with the new higher prices and stop the false advertisement .
3593,0,I made the mistake of going to this branch on a Friday at 4:30 pm They had 2 teller windows open and I counted 23 people in line with 4 greeters I had a simple check deposit and I didn't require a receipt I asked 2 of the greeters if they could handle the deposit for me as greeters do at their other branches but was told I would need to stand in line I will not make the same mistake twice and won't be returning to this branch.
4529,0,"The nicest things that I can say are overpriced lousy salt lick  If you like paying top dollar for lousy service dirty tables greasy silverware overly salty flavorless food then this is the place for you   Even the ""world famous"" pie was terrible  Save your money and buy a Marie Calendar's pie at the market and if you really want to make it taste like Rock Springs sprinkle a few packets of sugar on it  So much salt and sugar in this restaurant that only bovines should be dining there Nasty shameful If I could give it zero stars I would."

3710,0,"Extremely disappointed during my last visit here I came in during the evening and was immediately bombarded by rap music playing over the stereo system with every other lyric using the N-wordNow I regularly listen to songs like this on my own time and I'm pretty sure the owner does not know his employees are playing their music with this kind of offensive profanityTo be specific the song I heard playing was ""My Nigga"" by YGIn addition the service was slow I was waiting at the counter 5 minutes before I even saw an employee He told me he would be just a moment more Instead of waiting for him to do the more important thing (probably switching the song to ""Boss Ass Bitch"") I went elsewhere."
476,1,"My wife's tire popped a days ago and I was like great that's gonna be another 150 bucks to replace So I called them and asked how much is it to repair a tire and they said ""if I can fix it it won't cost a thing"" I was shocked So I brought it down and explained that I didn't have the money to buy a new so they gave me a used tire for free And told me to come on down when i get paid again to buy a new tire and im gonna do exactly that These people really care about they're customers and ensure the best service I found my new tire shop."
4342,0,Do not go here for fingerprint services I went to this location to have my fingerprints done for a fingerprint clearance card for school This store advertised this service for $20 so I chose this store to have my fingerprints done When I arrived at the store and told the clerk what I needed she handed me a small square ink pad and told me to roll my fingers on the ink pad and then on the paper She then charged me $20 and I was on my way I know nothing about fingerprinting I assumed they did 3 weeks later my card was returned to me because of the poor job I did Well big surprise I lost critical time for this time sensitve document Who advertises this service but does not actually provide the CORRECT service I went to the police department to have this done and it came out much darker and clearer and was obviously done properly by a trained professional Please stop offering this service since you are not trained on how to do fingerprintsI called the store to let them know of the situation and the clerk seemed way too busy to really listen to me didn't seem like he cared much and told me to bring my receipt in and have it redone Oh yeah that's what I want to do lose another 3 weeks of time on my time sensitive document Not a happy camper over here with this store.

3540,0,This is my least favorite sushi place in the valley  I think gas station sushi would have tasted better  The edamame wasn't cooked properly and had too much salt the tuna in the Alaskan roll tasted like it came straight out of a can and the soda was flat  The only thing that tasted okay was the water.
4702,0,FOOD- DECENTCUSTOMER SERVICE- HORRENDOUSThe worst restaurant experience we've ever had We've been to Rainforest Cafe before We did'nt think the service was going to be this deplorable We ordered an appetizer that never came until we finally flagged down the floor manager 50 minutes later That's after he passed by our table several times as we sat with empty plates no food and with two hungry chilldren We were told the appetizers were never entered into the system The manager removed the appetizer from our billAfter staring at empty glasses for an addtional 30 minutes the waitress finaly arrived and asked if we were ready for dessert We asked for the bill After finaly filling up my wife's iced tea upon request she then spilled the entire glass into my wife's expensive purse(purchased just 1 month ago) She then began wiping off my son's comic bookinstead of the purse as my wife pulled out her cell phone which was completely submerged in iced tea She said sorry and then gave my wife her rag so she could try and dry off her own purse We were then given the bill which we paid and left in disgust We immediately tried the phone and discovered it was ruined and not operational We went back and explained the situtaion to the manager who returned our money and reffered us to the district manager He in turn reffered us to corporate 3 days later we finally recieved a phone call from Emily who stated we had to send them the old phone and they would only reimburse us for its original value We explained the phone is discontinued as cell phones typicaly are in a matter of months and we could replace it for much cheaper as she was due for an upgrade through our carrier Emily insisted the new phone was not her concern only the replacement of the original phone It was also not a concern to her we were not seeking to have the purse replaced or cleaned just the phone One of the worst customer service experiences we've ever had Very minimal attempts to rectify a bad situation brought upon their own staff.

331,1,Love this place only wish I could convince the wife to go more often  My first experience with L & L was not in Phoenix but in Hawaii  Sister in law picked us up took us out to L & L in Hawaii Kai and took the food and ate on the beach with the waves rolling in  Of course it was excellent food  And of course once I returned home and saw the L & L up at Happy Valley I had to try to recreate that moment  And normally when you associate food with a very nice memory like that the next time you have it the food won't compare  Well guess what  The food at the Happy Valley L & L tastes just as good as what I had on the island sitting on the beach  That is a winner for me anytimeIncidentally I normally get the BBQ Mix plate (2 mac 1 rice no cabbage) which is the perfect amount of food to feed me for two mealsif I'm able to show enough restraint during the first meal to not reach the 'point of no return' (where you don't have enough food left for the second leftover meal)  Five stars for the tasty grub friendly service and clean store  Also kudos for the cherry cola in the soda fountain.
3812,0,"I have been to  Boston's twice - once on a weekday afternoon and a Friday during happy hour - and both times have I been grievously disappointed I am not especially picky about my eateries so long as they serve good food the place can look as dumpy as is permissable for satisfactory health inspection I am readily forgiving of flummoxed trainees the occasional forgotten condiment and the typical slowness of service during peak hours I respect people in positions to cater to my incessant hunger and possible alcoholism and I show this by accepting them for their occasional shortcomingsThat being said: Boston's is not forgiven The first time I came here upon the recommendation of a trusted friend we experienced downright sluggish service It was a Tuesday afternoon with nary a soul in the house save our two-person party and our rough-looking server couldn't be bothered to take our order in a timely fashion She argued with my friend and overcharged him for his beer then refused to pay us any mind after our food had been delivered Another seemingly more pleasant server noticed we'd been biding our time drinkless and fetched us our refills We overheard a catty exchange between the two women as Server of the Year swept past which told us right away that this lack of hospitality was not atypical of this potential ex-con that had taken our orderFlash forward to last Friday: despite having been underwhelmed by my maiden voyage to Boston's I ventured in again - this time in a party of three - only to wait awkwardly in the entryway for an upward of five minutes until someone emerged to seat us This 'someone' was exactly that - a seemingly random untagged man who could just as easily have been the general manager as some drunk at the bar  We were not given a choice of where to sit - a huge faux pas for any joint serious about its service Instead we were escorted into the bar/lounge area and instructed to sit at the awkward high table just around the corner from the bar When asked if we could be relocated to a booth we were refused the opportunityAt a spritely 5'2"" I don't fare well in chairs that sit over half my height off the ground and the space behind me was an uncomfortable flurry of movement to-and-from the kitchen Even at our easily accessible high-traffic location we were not offered so much as a glass of water We waited twenty minutes to be acknowledged in a near-empty bar well into the range of happy hour before abandoning our table and walking out As an added insult the entire exit was blocked by the man who'd seated us and a few identifiable employees We brushed passed effectively interrupting their conversation and the guy - more than likely the actual manager as opposed to an inebriated managerial impersonator - said nonchalantly ""Oh hey guys everything all right""""Yeah"" I muttered as I followed my stoic companions outside Apparently he had wax in his ears because he poked his little head out after us and asked again a bit sternly ""Guys Everything all right""I snapped ""Yes"" - the tone of which translated to: ""No jackass everything isn't all right"" But it wasn't worth arguing: we were parched hungry and too irate to be rational I've heard great things about Boston's but have yet to experience one I can chalk up a few mistakes to human error and the nature of the restaurant industry but the inattentiveness and general lack of hospitality demonstrated by the largely uncaring staff is too blatantly disrepectful to warrant a third shot."

2783,1,3 years ago Chef Johnny Chu set out to bring a hot pot restaurant to the Valley of the Sun If you're unfamiliar with Chef Chu he's the proprietor of the hip and popular downtown Phoenix Asian tapas joint Sens Now his dream is realized with the opening of Tien Wong Hot Pot Surprisingly his new restaurant isn't even located in downtown Phoenix but in the city of Chandler After talking with Chef Chu on my last visit he explained to me that this location was selected to prove out his concept in an Asian neighborhood Low rent and a discerning customer base he can make all the necessary tweaks for success and will hopefully bring Tien Wong to downtown in the futureFor many the whole hot pot experience might be foreign since many of us are used to having our food cooked for us forget that The idea of hot pot while romantic and interactive is all about you cooking various meats and vegetables in hot pots filled with flavored broths Each table is equipped with a high powered induction burner where you hot pot is placed and then you order as many different raw meats seafood vegetables and noodles as you desire Once our order started showing up I become overwhelmed and confused where do you start What are the cooking times What do I do Before allowing my head to explode I simply took a breather and one of the helpful staff to my aid In my calamity I didn't notice the helpful hints on the welcome card However it goes something like this the broth boils you drop in the thinly sliced meats pull out dip into one of 2 sauces sesame and soy then eat easy After only a few minutes of practice it all came together into a well crafted experience that's designed for socializing romance and lingering If you have difficulty choosing your broth opt for the Ying Yang Broth ($595) which includes both the house original herbal broth and the house spicy broth with the later being the most complex of the flavors I've tried Starting with pork stock the addition of dried dates ginseng Schezuan peppercorns and dried chiles give the base heat and depth Over the course of your evening the broth evaporates with cooking which adds to the intensity and enjoymentNot to be confused with the tips of peas Pea Tips ($4) actually are the leaves and stems surrounding the pea itself The tips cook fast and have both crunchy and tender qualities that taste so good either cooked or raw By contrast the Korean Pumpkin ($3) takes longer to cook but the payoff is so tender you can even eat the thin skinNoodles include springy Udon ($3) as well as a Flat Rice Noodle ($3) which resemble chewy flat pieces of rice than a noodle in the traditional sense Both cook up in a hurry and their absorbent properties are capable for taking in so much flavor Sliced Wagyu Beef ($8) comes from one of the best breeds of cattle in the world So its no surprise that the meat was flavorful and tender Add an order of Lobster ($9) if available for a surf and turf combo Names aren't always accurate descriptions take Sliced Black Pork ($4) which isn't black at all the name refers to the pigs breed since it has black hair and skin It's super tender and flavorful only taking a few seconds to cook thanks to expert slicing Desserts feature 2 different kind of cheesecake Strawberry ($6) and Green Tea ($6) both were light and satisfying the perfect ending to Chef Chu's dream.

4738,0,"Mulligans I am disappointed in you  This has previously been one of my favorite go to spots on the weekend and I used to think of it as the perfect place to end the night  However it has gone downhill over the past few months and after several horrible customer service experiences I do not think I will be frequenting this establishment again  Let me be specificIf you mess with my money - and do so consistently and without apologythen I will not return and I will be sure to tell as many people as I can regardless of how ""fun"" your bar might beA few months ago I went to Mulligans and when ordering my drink I asked them to just leave a tab open and handed them my card  I ended up ordering one more beer and then closed my $9 tab at the end of the night  The next day after checking my bank account I was astonished to see a $50 hold on my account from Mulligans  I immediately called them to inform them of the error but was told pretty rudely that it was standard procedure for them to hold $50 for any opened tab and that it would just ""fall off"" in a few days at my banknothing else they could do   They did tell me that there was a small sign on the bar that mentioned this policy and that I should have read it first (because that's apparently what people look for or notice when they go to the bar)  Furiously I waited for 5 business days for the funds to become available againA month or so later I went in again  Same situation same low dollar bill same $50 holdalthough this time I just kicked myself for not remembering it the first time  I did call the manager to ask if there was a way to avoid this other than paying cash (which I never carry) and was told that if I had closed my account after each drink rather than keep an open tab I would just be charged for the actual dollar amount owed each time  Good to know (although also a huge pain in the butt)Flash foward to last week  I went to Mulligans again this time for St Patricks Day  Based on my previous conversation with the manager I was confident that if I just closed out my tab each time I would be fine  I ordered one beer (specialty for $3 dollars) and closed out  Later that night I went back and ordered two more beers (total $6) and closed out  The next day I checked my accountand found that there were TWO holds on my account from Mulligans for $25 eachI immediately called again and explained the situation  The person on the phone immediately started in on their ""policy"" to hold funds when there is an open tab   I told him that I had been aware of that  and that is why I closed out each timeSo why I was being ""held"" $50 for a total of $9 was a mystery to me (and I was seriously regretting the tip at this point)  He stated ""well  the best I can tell you is to just wait for it to drop off there's nothing we can do""  I told him that was not an acceptable solution to me and he interrupted to say sarcastically ""you really need to take this up with someone elseI'm just the barback""  So I asked him to take down my phone number and have the manager call me that night  He took on an incredibly rude and sarcastic tone and said (overenthusiastically)   ""absolUTELY   I would LOVE to do that for you""  I ignored the tone and gave him my phone number anyway and again requested that the manager call me that night  He replied ""ABSOLUTELY"" again in his rediculous tone and then hung up on me  I never heard from the managerThis is incredibly poor customer service a poor way to handle your customer's money and a really EASY way to lose business  By the way it's 4 days later and the funds are still being held  This is a recession people I go places with cheap beer for a reason  And I can guarantee you there are a million other places to go in Scottsdale that serve $3 beers and don't do it while stealing from your pocketbook (even if it IS supposedly temporary)  I suggest staying away from this place unless you like to have your money taken and you enjoy rudeness."

4341,0,It was my birthday and I went here with my family We were seated and waited about 10 minutes A server told us she would be right with us We waited about another 10 minutes She brought bread to the table didn't say a word and left us again She didn't bring us water drinks or take our order After waiting about 25 minutes we got up and left We go to this Cheesecake factory a few times a month and usually have good service but because of this service it is highly unlikely we will ever return There were many other servers that we could see were not busy and not one of them came up when they could clearly see we had been waiting a long time We then went across the street and received great service from True Food as expected Extremely disappointed in our experience at the Cheesecake Factory.
2560,1,The doughnuts are fantasticOrdered a giant birthday doughnut and my car smelt like sugar the whole way home it was perfect  Customer Service was friendly  I'd go out of my way to stop here it's that yummy.
3933,0,This Walmart has the worst customer service ever They never have enough lanes open and don't open additional lanes even though the lines go through the middle aisle of the store Horrible I will absolutely pay more and shop elsewhere.
4015,0,OK so what if it's an authentic 1950s ice cream parlor The stuff they're scooping up is boring major brand-name label ice cream full of air and the toppings are nothing special And the wallpaper is dirty and faded And the carnival-esque decor is kinda creepy unfortunately like some of the elderly clientele who sit here staring sadly off into space as their ice cream sodas melt away You can almost imagine the opening scenes of a tear-jerker Lifetime movie set here That's not good.

1152,1,My new favorite spot Thanks Yelp We ordered the molcajete  with diablo sauce - be warned it really is spicy Not called diablo for nothing The flavor was still there and I love spicy but next time I'll try the tomatillo Bit too painful for me ( I ordered a horchata to try and help numb my swollen tongue)I really love the side of beanssalad and rice Beans are perfectly seasoned salad is tangy and refreshing and the rice has texture Not the pink puffy rice with minimal flavor that is served at so many mexican restaurantsThey also have strong margaritas and huge mugs of draft beerJust seeing the pictures makes me want to go there now.
2324,1,service is greatcomplimentary coffee and tea deliver to the roomI really like the setting of the suite and a very nice size patio facing the swimming poolit's a quiet little complex next to the Phoenician if you are looking for something a bit quiet this is the placeToo bad I came here when the weather is too cold to swimwill be back again next year.
1202,1,Came here to test out food for our company celebration it was great We booked and then had a really good time Nice beer selection.
1449,0,"I sadly had a similar experience to Kelly G  I have purchased several pairs of shoes from this store in the past and have referred friends as well as patients of mine here  I visited Suburban Sole on a Saturday and there were several ""snow birds"" in the store  I asked a clerk for help and she just told me to look at the front of the store for what I was looking for and went on to ask one of the other customers if she needed help  I am a small business owner and do my best to support other local businesses but have taken my business to the Shoe Mill in Tempe."
4106,0,I had lunch at the Scottsdale location this week  I was carrying a Contigo water bottle  The hostess who seated me asked what was in the water bottle  DUH - water  Odd- never had that happen before   I was seated right away but it took 1005 minutes for the person to take the order  Food came out very quickly  Chicken breast was lukewarm tough and not very tasty  KFC has better chicken for less money  Waffle was ok but the maple syrup had no maple flavor  Paid with a credit card and had to show a driver's license  Odd again -- can't recall that happening in a long time   There are many places to eat where the food is better and your water bottle is not treated with suspicion  Skip this place.
1590,1,Came here because of a bad experience at florindinos ( I should have known better) the food here is always amazing  The staff is very attentive and the place was packed (it's almost 2pm on a Wednesday) my server was busy with larger parties but my drink was never empty (Araceli) I've never had a bad experience here.
1385,1,The Pita Jungle first opened in Tempe in 1994 I don't remember when exactly I first visited this location but it was probably that same year or in 1995 Since then I have probably visited this particular location somewhere between 50 to 100 times I'm really a big fan of this place because they were the first to introduce me to Mediterranean food Beforehand I was not familiar with words such as hummus baba ganoosh taboule or tsatziki Ever since I've been a big fan of Mediterranean food because of it's distinct flavors and healthy optionsThe Pita Jungle in Tempe has evolved physically from the restaurant I remember when I was younger It use to be only half as big as it is today Right around 2005 they purchased the store next door and demolished the wall that divided them thus increasing their space to accomodate their large patronage The parking lot they share with the small plaza they occupy however has not grown Beware the limited parking available during lunch hours on weekdays Pita Jungle can get really packedThe interior of the restaurant is decorated with various pieces of artwork from local artists on the walls which changes every so often The ceiling is decked with exposed ducts which give the location a kind of industrial feel to it Also the servers pretty much wear everyday clothing In all I kinda  get a California somewhat Bohemian-feel for the environment Although it's probably lost some of that in the past couple of years every since it's grownI've tried all sorts of dishes at Pita Jungle but my all-time favorite at this location is the Glazed Chicken Lavosh Pizza When I use to work in Tempe I frequently chose this dish I really like all the other dishes I've tried at Pita Jungle I guess it's just a matter of what you're in the mood for My other recommendations if you are eating in are the Wood-fired Fresh Salmon Spicy Mango Shrimp and Chicken Del Sol I might point out that the Chicken Del Sol is a protein-rich dish containing chicken and beans It's a pretty healthy serving for the low price of 6 to 8 bucks I don't frequent this particular location like I use to Furthermore I've only had one bad experience at this location but why let one bad experience put a damper on my overall long patronage I'm kinda tempted to give it 4 stars because my tastes have differed over the years but I don't really have anything critically negative to say about this Pita Jungle so I would be willing to give it 5 stars.

2485,1,Love happy hour at Roy's It is our favorite date night spot $6 apps and signature drinks I crave the original Hawaiian martini and the spicy tuna roll Sliders with sweet potato fries are delish Have dined here for supper on our anniversary and everything was excellant The Szechaun pork ribs were amazing Surf and turf was great and the pineapple upside down cake with coconut ice cream was so tasty They even brought out a mini desert sampler and had a special menu insert with our names on it wishing us a happy anniversary.
620,0,I have been on Phoenix for over 30 years  I always loved Bill Johnson's In the last few years they have gone to hell in a hand basket    Their beef ribs were very large with huge chunks of meet on them  Tender and full of flavor  They have been cutting back and back   I went last night for ribs  They were burned black and hard no flavor   I mentioned that the entire menu has no lighter fare on it  The new menu still does  The waitresses are not carrying 67 guns  (Too expensive) not  The condiments have disappeared from the tables  I I am sure the veges are from cans  They surely need a make over  Back to good BBQ lighter fare reasonable pricing and tell the public they are back to the old ways  Otherwise go chew and old retread.
2431,1,i love this place best tom kah gai (coconut milk soup) ever EVER i have tried plenty of thai places and not a single one comes close to being as fantastic as malee's soup i moved out of state recently and every time i visit malee's is one of my first stops i will cry if they ever go out of business.

308,0,Sooooo overrated  I've been here three times now and this last time will be my last  I don't mind a wait if the food and experience are worth it but when you finally get seated at a teeny table with  not enough room for the plate coffee cup and flatware and then the menu is limited to Denny's fare and just a hair above their qualitywell just go to Denny's  I haven't been to Denny's in ten years it will be longer than that before I go back to Matt's Big Breakfast  Not a fan of greasy food.
3610,0,I was given a prepaid detail as a gift I made my appointment took my White truck to be detailed They called me a few hours later and said it was ready to be picked up I inspected my truck when I got home I only live a mile from this location my truck looked horrible Wheel wells-not cleaned(still had dirt in them) bed of the truck-not clean(still had dirt in it) tires-looked terrible due to whatever the slime was that they sprayed on them interior- don't even think it got vacuumed(found a peanut and white dog hair I have a black dog that I do not let ride in my truck) they left spots on my floormats from where they cleaned one spot(didn't clean the entire mat) my dash was covered in that nasty slime & my rearview mirror and visor mirror still had fingerprints on them All that isn't the worst part the thing that made this a horrible place to get a detail is that they had actually managed to Swirl a WHITE truck How do you swirl a white truck I would hate to see what they would have done had I taken in a dark colored vehicle I even found bugs on the front of my truck I only live a mile away I couldn't have gotten that many bugs from the drive home I won't even go back for a carwash I'm not sure how much was paid for my detail but I do know that the person that paid for it got robbed.
4068,0,I won't ever go back The food wasn't very good nor was the service But the worst part about my experience was how dirty the place is I had to ask my server to remove the sugar packets holder from the table because of how dirty it was The salt & pepper shakers same thing Totally gross The floors haven't been cleaned in some time as well I'm not usually skeeved out too easily but ICK Shame on them.

3104,0,so i walked by this place a few weeks ago and noticed a sign 'closed temporarily due to family illness' okcool whatever  Yesterday walked by again and saw an eviction notice on the door a cowrker and I decided to be nosey and looked in the windows the whole place had been gutted out I guess the family illness was no customers.

3094,0,"My boyfriend and I grew up on Serrano's living in Tempe It had been years since we have been so we figured we would stop in for happy hour I cant believe how badly this place has gone down hill Though there was only a few tables of people in the whole place we decided to sit at the bar in hopes of faster service Upon sitting down there was dirty dishes left on the bar that looked like they had been there awhile The buser quickly came over and cleaned up and brought us chips and dips (he was probably the most attentive person in this place) We had to flag the bar tender down to get drinks (mind you there was only 2 other people at the bar) The drinks were horrible No Tabasco on hand for a bloody Mary and no oranges for the blue moon they have on tap really you have Blue Moon on tap and no oranges I had to ask the bartender 3 times for a water the last time she said ""ya sure"" then walked in back for 5 minutes The fourth time my boyfriend finally asked her for my water and had her remake me something to drink as the bloody Mary was unbearable We then had to ask for menus and also had to ask her to take our order I mean what is your job if I as the customer am doing all the work The manager brought our plate out it was cold The food was mediocre at best what a disappointment especially for the price My boyfriend asked the bartender for silverware which she said ""oh yeah sure"" then walked off and did something else I told him not to even remind her and see if she will ever bring it Nope we ended up sharing silverware We spoke with the manager when we left about how poor the service was he didn't seem to care much just staring at us with a blank expression So that is if for us we will not be back So sad that we use to love this place and it has gone down the drain so much."
945,0,Think of the name of the restaurant as an oxymoron and you're on the right trackDisgusting food cheap ingredients unfriendly staff and pathetic dining area  I lived on this food when I was broke 2 years ago and I regret it I'd have rather gone into debt.
932,1,Last Saturday my friend and I said what else is there to do on a Saturday afternoon except eat drink and hang out  We definitely went to the right place to do this  The new NoRTH in Arcadia Sam Fox's latest creation met our every need  I started off with a Stray Dog to drink  I'm not sure what was in it but it looked pretty and tasted good so I guess that's all that matters  My friend tasted it and ordered that as her second drink since it was so good   For an appetizer we ordered the bread & cheese  I had no idea what to expect because it said it came with tomato jam  What is tomato jam  I'm still not sure I know but I know I would go back to specifically order this  The garlic bread came with warm melted Italian cheese almost like fondue in a little skillet  The bread with the cheese and the tomato jam was the perfect biteMmmm   Next we ordered a pizza to split  Verdure was the name of it  It was topped with brussels sprouts butternut squash caramelized onions hazelnuts and ricotta salata  Need I say more  Delish  My friend and I even told the valet guy on our way out to make sure he tried the pizza with the butternut squash  Next we split a pasta which was a recommendation from our waiter  (Obviouslyhow could someone not recommend this)  This was definitely my favorite  The Agnolotti (definitely homemade)  was filled with ricotta mascarpone pecorino grana padano and topped with herb butter  The sauce was so light that it allowed you to eat every single bite and we both did without being too rich  I don't usually eat pasta but I will definitely be eating this again soon  It really was so delectable  Next we split the Scottish salmon salad  How come I would never think to put marcona almonds and figs in my salmon salad with white balsamic  It was so tasty and flavorful  The food being served at tables near us definitely kept catching my eye  Everything looked so unique and appetizing  Besides the food the atmosphere was also very fun and chill  We were just enjoying our afternoon hanging out and eating amazing food  Oh wait I forgot my second drink  I got the Red Rooster which was like a fancy version of a Bloody Mary  It came with a little skewer of a caprese on it - really it came with little tomatoes and mozzarella on top of it  So awesome  We also ordered affogato for dessert but I was too full to eat it  My friend said it was orgasmic  Guess that explains that  All of the waiters were very attentive  Service is not always good at a new restaurant although here it was exceptional  It was fun to check out (no pun intended) all their different plaid and checked shirts too  Boring uniforms at a Fox Restaurantnever  I even told my friend and one of our waiters that this is the best Fox Restaurant yet  I don't live as close to this restaurant as a lot of other Fox Restaurants but I will definitely be back and cannot wait to try more yummy food.

240,1,After having a SCAM like experience with the ATLAS Locksmith (foreign network inside the US) and nearly being burned by their dubious operations I turned to Avid Locksmith  Did some online research and noted Zach's stellar rating  He lived up to the ratings and feedback  He quoted me for the service call re-keying a front security door and provide 4 keys  His rate was what ATLAS Locksmith originally quoted me however ATLAS Locksmith did not live up to their word instead tried to raise the price during their service call  Are you kidding  No I am not  Zach was a professional and consistent thru the entire process and took my credit card over the phone  He even emailed me a copy of the paid invoice after the work was completed just like he said he would  Zach at AVID Locksmith is the real deal folks  He has been enlisted as one our trusted vendors  Thank you Zach.
1825,1,My favorite dog park in the valley Lots of great owners and dogs Let's start with just getting to the park I've never seen the parking lot full even on the busiest of weekends when softball games are going So great parking The park has 3 different areas 1 area is always closed to regrow grass which is nice There is an active area and a passive area Entrances are double gated and also have separate gates for if you are leaving or coming inside Once you are inside the grounds are maintained pretty well I've seen a few times that mud puddles have started from over watering but that is very very rare Each area has its own little play area One has a small selection of agility training objects 1 has a series of tubes that your dog can jump up and go through the tubes and the last area has a series of boulders to jump on Dog owners are attentive and pick up after their pets Although you will see the occasional poop in the grass So watch your step Also on the active side I've been happy to see some knowledgeable dog owners who know the difference between play fighting and an actual dog fight My dog is the most playful dog I've ever seen and enjoys doggy boxing leading to a game of chase The only negative thing about the park is the water fountain Water pressure is horrible and also there is only 1 fountain in each area On nights and weekends when it is super busy there is a giant crowd of dogs trying to get some water.

1296,1,"No dings on this one Always a great time and the food is terrific Service is friendly and personal Drinks are generous Perfect up scale dinner house light level - makes everyone look good I can't think of anything I would change The house rotisserie chickens are featured in a showcase on the south side of the buildingI'm sure just to get you salivating (Also check out their ""Flying Chicken"" - under the radar takeout via the back door Very Cute) Not a huge menu but lots of comfort items great variety and consistently excellent all the way Deviled eggs cornbread gets a big thumbs up and I'm a big fan of the Macho Salad I could eat that everyday Can't wait to go again Soon."
4713,0,This was a very bizarre land of contradiction It really seemed unclear as to whether this was supposed to be a bar that served food and had bands a restaurant that had douches and band a venue that also had food etc They then told us we could sit at the only table there or not They were still serving food no they weren't yes they were Maybe it was our bad for going for dinner but what was the cover for The alleged entertainment certainly didn't earn it   Food was ok i suppose as long  the other choice was Chef Boyardee The staff was oblivious over loaded and disorganized The whole experience reminded me why I was skeptical to begin with.
1282,0,This might be okay for young 20-somethings out to get smashed on $3 Happy Hour beers before heading over to the next mall bar across the parking lot but it's no good for elderly 30-year-olds intent on dinner conversation If you're satisfied to eat @ one of the bar tables you're set but if you're looking for old fashioned floor level seating good luck  After a 2 hour wait (and our party had actually arrived before we joined them) we two stepped over to a restaurant where we could actually sit down  And where we could hear each other w/o having to fight some blaring obnoxious pop musicCan't comment on the food because we never got any  Happy hour beers WERE cheap but $19 for two Happy Hour Absolut and Red Bulls is highway robbery if you ask me Server was nice enough  Mildly entertaining watching wasted floozies get flung from the mechanical bull  Could have done w/o the bloody boxing match on TVWheelchair accessible but only if you can get one of those aforementioned elusive tables otherwise you'll be at the perfect height to rest your head on the table while everyone towers above youPretty sure I'm never going back here  Not really my scene  Perfect if you want to rev up your man date w/ your bull riding skills before some hot drunken anonymous weekend sex though.
4614,0,I had Vday dinner here last night and was not happy at all  The food was cold and under expectation  The service was disappointing the food was cold and the wine selections were poor  20% tip was included which is ok except the service was terrible  However why should the service be exceptional when it is an automatic add on  Since there was an automatic tip add on the staff should step it up and justify that their tip was well derserved  Between my bf and I we each try an option on their pre-fixed menu  Our first course was salad and soup which was ok  Secound course was fancy rice w brocolli (which is rice) and my bf had pork-belly (which is two slices of lard) eat it if you want to clog up your artery (both dishes were served cold and we waited at least 30 minutes per plate)  Third was pan seared scallops which smelled fishy and served cold after 40 minute wait time  Then there was new york steak which is not served hot not tender and filled with chewy sections  Fourth was the dessert which i have to eat a lot of because I was still hungry forcing myself to eat all the terrible courses listed above  To point out why it was a bad experience the place wanted to charged customers each $60 for a four course and an automatic 20% tip on top of your total bill  The fact that I am complaining about the price is because the food selection was not up to par nothing was fresh or served in its appropriate temperature  We had to wait for our replacement of forks and knieves between courses even after they brought out luke warm  Nothing about our experience was impressive perhap The House at Secret Garden should focus on excellent service best selected produce & poultry before charging so much for mediocre quality in food and terrible service  This experience definitely ruined my V day and will never come back  I literally was robbed feel that the wait for service and food was not worth it  Cafe Monarch Mastro at Ocean Club are better options  True Food would have done better then The House at Secret Garden  In addition wine selection was crap  We paid $210 and know for a fact that we will never ever return  Dislike this place so much I spend my wed morning to inform people who has higher expectation to avaoid such tragic.
1753,1,The Tempe location got a nice bit of redoing and is now a lot bigger but the southern half of the place is still hilariously and charmingly small I love sitting so close to the cooksTip: they half bake pasties for the next day late at night so if you order one then it's noticeably different The super fresh 11pm cajun pasty I got after (during) my bachelor party may be the most delicious thing I've eaten The bar's got wonderfully cheap car bombs and they leave a nice note on the receipt when you get one.
4869,0,"Sometimes in life you winSometimes you looseToday I lostReluctant to go in shady strip mall uninviting exterior  But asked a few people coming out if the food was any good and they said ""Excellent"" ""Been eating here for 10 years""  So we thought sure that is a great endorsement from strangersWhat were they smokingWalked into a empty Restaurant at noon only to find a very modern decor and thought OK it is clean and I like the stainless steel table topsAnd that is when what I liked came to an end:Started with the most boring lukewarm soup in the World the Wonton Noodle soup bland is the motto here  And I like my soup hot by the way WTFNext came the lunch not-so-specials:1) Wife: had the sweet and sour special boring  But worst of all it appeared undercooked so we told the very nice lady and she assured us that it is cooked twice once before customer orders and once after and again I say WTF  That doesn't sound good  They brought her a new order but wife insists the chickens had a strange McNugget texture to it2) Me: the bland and uninspiring House Special Chicken bland boring fried rice no carrots or peas or egg in it just boring fried rice  And the egg roll is a spring roll and I hate spring rolls  My chicken was cooked but it wasn't very good  Drowned in garlic and some dull brown sauceAnd the worst of all: the bill (for lunch brau)$2799 (before tip) for 2 teas 2 not-so-lunch-specials and the worst soup known to manShame actually if they put as much effort into their dull food as they do the interior then it could be goodWon't be back  Rule of thumb if a Restaurant is empty at Prime lunch hour it is for a reason."
4683,0,I have given this place a few chances over the last month or so (twice with my man and once with the girls) The female servers we had are so RUDE It's like we are interrupting their day I don't get it Maybe they want a different kind of clientele(olderfamiliesboring) We aren't demanding and tip well They would rather stand by the bar and talk with each other and the manager What a joke The drinks (when we could get service) and ambiance are pretty good We have had three different servers and they all seemed to not really care Too bad so sad Next.
4565,0,"While I have absolutely no complaints about the food this review is for the service receivedThe first time I received disrespectful service when I went with my best friend I spoke to the manager about it and let it go Now that this has happened again I'm letting fellow Yelpers know I went in with my boyfriend on a Monday around 2pm it was not busy yet there was no one there to greet us nor sit us down at a table After standing there and seeing the other servers look at us my boyfriend had to walk up to the bar and ask for help It was only then that a guy came out from behind the bar to sit us down at a table As he returned to the bar it took another few minutes before a girl came around to bring us two glasses of water and walk away That was it no greeting whatsoever When we finally were able to order our food the girl asked my boyfriend what kind of bread he wanted As it was his first time there he didn't know what the options were and what the difference was between the breads Instead of explaining it to him when he asked the girl simply stared at him like he was stupid and asked again if he wanted chiabata or focaccia So I had to explain it to him instead TALK ABOUT BEING RUDE & DISRESPECTFUL The rest of the time we were there the only time we had any ""help"" from the servers was when they brought our food or refilled our water glasses Not once did anyone say anything to us or ask if we needed anything I wanted to ordered a drink but decided not to if they didn't even care to askNote: I've never had an issue with the male staff/servers but the females are (excuse my language) b****es They seriously need to hire female servers who are friendly and provide good customer service to EVERYONE."
162,1,Brigetts is a great neighborhood bar It has a lot of variety Excellent Happy Hour along with some type of entertainment  Trivia Karaoke and even comedy once a week It's good bar food along with breakfast served all day Bar staff and servers were fine and would chat with you if they weren't busy Not many places can you get a HH draw of beer for a Buck.
4956,0,Makes the olive garden look five star Despite their claims they most certainly are not using all fresh ingredients and the food is bland bland bland with a metric ton of garlic The pizza is awful and overpriced When I complained they comped me $25( which is nearly twice the price of a pizzeria bianco's pizza) at which point I gave them another try The lasagna was so bland the salad was absolutety Spartan All the way around avoid this place You'd enjoy Italian from fuzzolis better.
3726,0,"You can't really criticize BWW for the mediocre food served in paper boats and dressing packets for salads  They are a national company that seems to be doing something right considering their success  However you'd think such success would translate to some kind of service standard  I can tell from other reviews that I am not the only one that received remarkably bad service at this place  It was the ASU v UofA football game and the place was overflowing  According to our server the shortage of bartenders justified our second round of drinks taking more than an hour MORE THAN AN HOUR  Unfortunately for him the lack of bartenders could not be blamed for the food taking even longer  At one point after checking three times to see if a runner had brought our drinks someone got up from the table to ask him if they were ever going to come  His response ""You didn't order more drinks""  Let me say that again  He checked back with us three times to see if we had gotten a round of drinks that according to him we never ordered  Confused  So were we If they keep this up they won't last much longer than Six Shooters."
483,1,We found everything to be wonderful  The brie platter for the appetizer was tasty and gone in short order  One of us ordered the fillet and the other the pork loin  Cooked perfectly and enough that we each took half home  The special tartes was pumpkinthere was none of that left over It was a great idea to use our groupon on Halloween nightonly a few tables through the entire meal  Server was attentive and chatted with us when we asked about their upcoming move in 2014.
101,1,Nice local neighborhood place to come and enjoy  Excellent food  Nightly happy hours and weekend entertainment  I recommend the Swedish sliders.
1485,0,Terrible Terrible  TerribleThe food here is absolutely horribleI wouldn't feed it to my worst enemyIt made me feel sick --   I definitely won't be back.
272,1,They are getting more Big flat screens Is that possible Just wanted to get a shout out about the amazing sound system and open concept of 360 degrees of football $4 bloody Mary's yesterday - man were they good with all the fixins Love this classy place.
997,1,I like good Pho and I cannot lie  You brothers and sistas can't deny  When the broth is steamin and the sides are fresh you get sprung  You wanna pull up a chair cuz you know it's stuffed with noodles deep in that bowl their servin'  I'm hooked cause I can't stop eating  Oh baby I wanna take some home along with some spring rolls  My homeboy tried to warn me but that Pho's got mememe so hungry - Enjoy.
2680,1,I definitely enjoyed staying at The Clarendon This was a quick stop on our road trip but it didn't feel like we missed anything because this hotel seems to be a hot spot in town Lots of locals at the pool and fun people at the bar Definitely an enjoyable and comfortable stay.
4915,0,I recently accompanied my friend several times to the Fred Meyers Jewelry store located in Fry's Marketplace Her and her fiancee previously purchased their wedding bands from them and she wanted to get them engaged with their wedding date as a surprise to him When we dropped them off she asked would their be a problem with them being engraved and she was informed no their wouldn't be We looked around the store some more and discussed making another purchase My initial thought after this visit was that it was a very casual and a little unprofessional for my liking in a jewelry store The following week we returned to pick up the bands The engraving on her 14K gold band was clear and done well Her fiancee's band however appeared to be barely legible She asked why that is and she was informed that the person the bands were sent to outsourced to someone else because of the titanium material made him nervous She asked why no one called her and informed her it would be a problem or told her initially The saleswoman then became confused and said she could ask if they could engrave it again My friend pointed out to her that she just said because of the material it was already difficult to engrave She said she would ask if it could be done again The manager then took notice of the disagreement and he came over He mentioned with his loop he could see the engraving He then discussed with the jeweler and confirmed it couldn't be done My friend asked if his staff is aware of that He said yes and she informed him that that wasn't the case and that she is dissatisfied with her experience Here is where things took a turn The manager got defensive and then asked my friend why she didn't ask   This is when I  interjected that he was out of line and she isn't the expert his staff is suppose to be I also pointed out that an engraving shouldn't take a loop like he pointed out to see It defeats the entire reason for having an engraving If no one was able to read it what was the point And his not communicating has unnecessarily devalued the ring It was her decision to make not their's His blaming the customer approach is horrendous service and why I will never make a purchase there He then informed my friend that he would only charge her for one engraving We immediately left The thing that bothers me beyond the lack of his staff being informed or that he took no accountability is that it was their wedding bands They have blemished their experience  unnecessarily with this horrific service If you have an option I encourage you to seek out another jewelry store.
3242,0,Not Impressed  Music way to loud - server was an order taker People smoking on the patio (Gross) after waiting for 10 minutes for the Ice Tea we ordered having smoke drift into my lunges and then struggling to hear the person I was sitting with -- we got up and left  Yes it looks charming BUT there is something off about this place  We wont be back.
2911,0,This is a super belated review for this café (more than a year old) but I have a grudge that I need to voice During finals week one semester I ordered a coffee It was super hot which is normally a good thing but after more than 10 minutes of waiting I really wanted to drink it There were about three people in line and since I still had 15 minutes before my exam I got back in line and waited to ask for some iceInstead of bringing me a small cup of ice an employee came from behind the counter with a scoop of it Instead of waiting for me to set my cup down the employee proceeded to dump the ice in my cup while I was still holding it spilling hot coffee all over my hand and the floor Did I get a sorry Nah He stared me down like it was my fault and then stalked off without even bothering to cleaning it up I left for class about ten minutes after the incident and there was still coffee all over the floor You couldn't pay me to reconsider this place.
1377,1,This place rocks  Great food  great price  great serviceThey are busy but we usually can get a seat within ten minutes And the food comes out in seven minutesThey have it down to a science.
735,1,I'm trying to cut down on the number of places that I give five stars to and only give that if a business really really deserves it but I have to give five stars to Pho Avina  They have the best Vietnamese food that I've found in the valley and I've tried the majority of the Vietnamese restaurants in the heavily Asian part of Chandler (Cyclo Pho Van Anise etc)  The pho here is absolutely terrific and is really packed full of flavor  The other dishes I've tried have also all been fantastic and everyone I've taken here has absolutely loved it  Seriously nobody has had a bad dish or a bad experience  The staff is extremely friendly and if you have questions about anything they'll spend as much time as you need helping you out even though it might be in slightly broken English  Add on to all of this that you can get a huge bowl of pho for $7 and there's really nothing bad that can be said about this placeGuess what else  They have boba tea  I was concerned that when I was living in North Phoenix for a few weeks I wouldn't be able to get boba tea as easily as I could in Chandler but Pho Avina once again saves the day  Their boba is a little bit softer than I prefer but it's still good and definitely worth gettingFinally if you're feeling really adventurous Pho Avina has both durian boba tea and durian ice cream  I haven't checked but they may even be able to bring you a small plate of durian if you ask nicely  For those who don't know durian is a fruit that grows in Southeast Asia and is known for having one of the most foul odors of anything in the world  Durians smell so bad that some Asian countries have banned them from subways and other public places similar to smoking bans  People either love them or hate them - I personally think durian tastes like a mix of rotten onions and garlic so I'm not a big fan  A friend of mine thinks they taste like a mix of feet and death and actually instantly threw up the first time he bit into a piece of the fruit  Still though some people absolutely love durian and it's definitely something worth trying once in your lifeThis place has it all and although I'm moving out of Phoenix in just a few days I'm going to make damn sure that I visit Pho Avina every time I come back.
3520,0,Had sod installed by them At first they were very prompt but soon after the work was scheduled there was always a scheduling issue After the sod was finally installed late I might add there were problems with the sprinkler system that they just replaced all the heads on as they were crooked and not high enough I was told when they came to look at the sprinklers that I was keeping the grass too long They have attempted to remedy the sprinkler issues twice now with no luck but the problem is that they used too short of a sprinkler Previously my sprinklers were 4 inches tall this allows them to be placed further in the ground but yet extend higher above ground but Green ServPro removed all of them and put in 2 inch sprinklers which is what is causing all the sprinkler problems Tyring to cut the grass shorter was a joke because when they laid the sod the yard was either not smoothed out well enough or they didn't roll the sod properly because when you try to cut it some parts of the lawn end up scalped because of the uneveness of the lawnI never had issues with the sprinklers or the uneveness of the lawn before Green ServPro removed the old lawn and resodded it I decided to give Green ServPro one last chance and have them overseed my lawn for winter grass as they sent me an offer in my email After attempting to contact them twice in regards to this I have yet to hear anything from them and believe that they hope I will just go awayDealing with the office staff is no better as the lack of communication is laughable with this company How places like this stay in business is beyond me.
2753,1,Relatively unknown but everything there is amazing Everyone that works there is so friendly too Try the cinnamon and sugar bagel Awesome.
2826,0,Switch was recommended to me so we went there for dinner on a very slow weekday night when there were no more than three other tables Two of our party received their food in relatively short order My plate didn't show up until over 30 minutes later at which point the rest of the table was finished eating and needed to leave That situation wouldn't have happened if our waiter had been checking on us periodically or even been visible so I could have stopped him to have him check (Having had to leave the table prior to ordering just to locate him and put in our order should have been my clue that this was off to a bad start)I am very accommodating and understand when a restaurant is busy that this can happen but I felt there was no excuse for the delay I was very disappointed and have better places to spend my money and time I'd recommend looking elsewhere.
1022,1,My friend and I when here one day for lunch and we were both very impressed Both of our dishes were beyond delish We also had kiddos with us and though they didn't have a kids menu they still catered to them and had no problem they were with us (of course they were very well behaved) I took a look at their dinner menu and though it is a little pricy I really want to go back and give it a try I love all of the seafood options Service and atmosphere were both very nice as well.
4228,0,I have to agree with the other reviewers on their views of this pizza hut It's a real shame because a real pizza hut where that you can actually sit down and enjoy a pizza with your family is becoming a rare thing indeed Many of them have converted to the take out/delivery only format I was thrilled to see a sit down pizza hut in Casa Grande Unfortunately the service quickly tamed any excitement I was feeling over the location and style of the restaurant Every time we eat here we are greeted by consistant rude and unprofessional service My wife is a huge fan of pizza hut so we deal with the terrible service because we have toit's the only pizza hut in town If it was up to me we would stick to T and M pizza all the time and ignore this establishment entirely.
328,1,I tried out this restaurant a few weeks ago when it just opened  I think I got the pan friend noodle entree with beef  It was delicious I also had a taste of my friend's noodle soup and it was light but fulfilling  I did not get food coma after I left this place which I think is a good thing  I am Vietnamese and I heard Cambodian cuisine is similar to Vietnamese food or at the least it got it influence from Vietnamese cuisine  Though I cannot critique Cambodian food with much authority I've eaten homecooked Cambodian food at my friend's house before so I can say Sekong by Night's is comparable to homecooked food :)  Give it a try I'm sure you won't be disappointed.
3071,1,This place is quite amazing I cannot believe I never knew it was here beforeMy girlfriend is crazy over growing our own food However we live in the city not the country so we really cannot do it She is certain that we can and willSo when we came back from Italy last time I bought 5 fruit treesThe AZ type of fruit lemon orange cumquat etcI ended up by taking back the grapefruit tree because I had no where to plant itWe ran out of spaceThen we found this place wonderful trees of all sorts Now she is on a roll we have to move or fill our entire land with trees I am guessing we have to move I think we have no room for more trees at the moment but when we do this is where we will be going for sureIf nothing else this place is educational Lychee trees evenI think she wants an avacado treeit reminds her of living in Hawaii.
1593,1,I've rented from this Uhaul 3 times It is fast and affordable and they don't try and upsel you a bunch of crap you don't need Mike has been here a long time and he is very helpful and friendly.
3365,0,Whenever I get my food- it's cold I don't know why I ever go there I keep hoping it'll turn around- like the others This is expressly a Frosties Only location for me.
1894,1,Haven't been to a Vietnamese restaurant since I left Colorado almost three years ago But for what it's worth this is the best most authentic Vietnamese cuisine I've had so far =).
4602,0,I purchased a gift certificate from LocalDines for this place as it is close to home so I thought we'd give it a try  Upon arriving we presented it to our waitress who informed us that the manager no longer accepts them even though I only bought it a week ago  Now I have to try to get a refund on the certificate since they won't honor the deal that they made  We were also informed that they no longer do 1/2 off bottle of wine night on Friday's (even though their website STILL says they do)  They did give us a discount for the trouble but that doesn't make up for their bait and switch on the gift certificate (which was $10 for a $30 gift cert) and the false advertising on their own website  The waitress was very nice about it so we decided to stay since we were already thereThe food was typical to above average for a bar drink prices were nothing special even at happy hour  I had the Chicken Cesar Focaccia which was a little dry and not really as tasty as what I'm accustomed to at Zipps  My wife liked her salad and soup generous for a 1/2 salad  They did not make a good first impression so I don't anticipate going back  If they're not willing to do what's right based on their promotions and own advertising then I'm not going waste my time with them in the future  Just not good business.
3921,0,"We used to come here a lot but then not long ago had a very poor experience  That coupled with their ever increasing already ridiculously high prices has made us not returnSo the last time we were there for 2 adults with beverages and tax it was around $30  Really   I can go to a much nicer place get just as full and have decent table service for less  The salad is ok though the selection in good  The soups are average and the bread is mediocre at bestSo on the night in question my wife and 2 kids and me went for dinner which came to $48  A short while after I started eating I began to not feel well  NOT (let me be clear) in any way related to the food but because of other issues  I was not able to eat and had eaten less than half of the salad on my plate  I asked a server if I could take the rest with me as I was not feeling well  She said she didn't know and walked away  A moment later a new person came to the tabel who I assumed was a manager though she did not introduce herself  She told me that I could not take my food home with me unless I paid for a ""to-go"" meal  I got a bit annoyed and told her that was not acceptable  She disappeared and a few minutes later the store manager came out  He explained that I would be charged a separate to-go charge if I took my food with me which was about the same price as the meal  I told him that I had already paid for this particular food I didn't want anything else and only wantedto take what was on my plate and have it later  He again stated that it was store policy to charge me a to go charge  I said ""so what you're telling me is that it is ok for you to take the plate and dump it in the trash but I can't take MY food that I have alreay PAID FOR home and eat it later""  What BS is this I was a bit upset and we ended up leaving without my uneaten salad  What really was the final straw was the manager saying ""Thank you come again"" when I was leaving in a very snotty toneI filed a complaint with corporate which remains ignored  I will instead go to Souper Salad across the street and have better food and service and my wife and I can eat for $15 for both of us."
4434,0,C and R used to provide good service but I can't say that anymore They messed up on changing my bettery never tightened the bolts and I almost stalled in traffic I finally did stall and they told me something else was wrong with the car til it was towed to the shop and they realized it was their mistake Also our rear window was broken and they checked the fuses and charged me $100 to rip apart our back door Onlt to tell me that the mechanism is broken and it'll be $850 to replaceoddly enough my husband fiddled with the wires and its as good as newDo NOT give them your businesshorrible in everyway.
2300,1,I was so excited when I was their store sign go up I usually get my flavored oils and vinegars while driving thru Cottonwood once a year I'm so glad i can now purchase them locally I love that you can taste the flavors before purchasing The owners local Laveen residents are friendly and love talking about how to cook with the oils/vinegars I have purchased four flavors and use them for making salad dressing for dipping bread and as extra flavoring for grilling veggies I also bought a dessert vinegar that I like to pour over fruit Yum I saw the owners at a local event Second Friday Laveen Art Walk and they mention that they now offer  their space for events and small parties Great for a girls night out wedding shower etc You can byob  You got to check them out.
1945,1,Very reasonable priced service was nice and friendly family oriented  WiFi is free go on in and set up you can enjoy a meal and get work done at the same time.

3675,0,On December 19 2012 we took a prescription into CVS for Fluconazole  The tech advised us that for 60 tablets the price would be way over $200 and also advised that if we took the Rx to Fry's it would be much cheaper  Thinking the savings would be negligible we went ahead with 30 tablets at a cost of $10699  Requiring a refill we had the Rx moved to the Fry's store close to our home at the recommendation of the physician's nurse and were absolutely mortified when we got 60 tablets January 11 2013 for $16  Possibly we're talking the price difference between brand name and generic but then why didn't CVS offer us generic  What a total ripoff by a large chain that we thought we could trust - you can rest assured that will be the last Rx we ever take into a CVS store  Now we know why so many people take their prescriptions to Fry's.
2871,1,This place has everything  Even the old type double edge razors  They also have the straight edge ones with disposable blades for $15 and $17  I paid $79 for the same type of razor in San Francisco at one of those fancy stores that also sells tobacco  The lady in the store was great too  Very friendly and helpful I have to say that she should be a model for shampoo  I almost asked her for hair dye that would be her color  Anyway great little store if they don't have something they will get it for you.
1427,1,Tops is hands down the best beer/liquor/wine store  The employees are always helpful with suggestions and they all know their stuff They usually have great sales on spirits or beers they are looking to clear from their inventory The only negative of this place is that their wine is overpriced.
4656,0,Have been to  El Chorro's many times in the past but always outdoors or at the bar Went with good friends on Xmas Eve and had some of the worst service ever It's not like they don't know what to expect on a holiday Everyone had a reservation and the menu was fixed Nevertheless the service was painfully slow (we were there over 3 hours) They made numerous mistakes They couldn't keep our wine or water glasses full They even claimed to have run out of potatoes ReallyYou're a Phoenix icon not a fly by night franchise Get it together.
2553,1,Great burgers and good prices  Their shakes are legit  You can combine flavors (oreo-coffee is my favorite)  Also they have fresh squeezed lemonade which is quite refreshing with your burger and fries.
636,0,"I went into this store several years ago when it first opened and remembered it being okay  So when I decided to sell a wedding/engagement ring set I thought I would come here first for a quote  When I walked in I noticed they have completely remodeled it and it looks something between a check cashing store a jewelry store and a goodwill  An older man who was walking behind one of the booths saw me and decided it wouldn't be too much of a bother to help me  (basically he seemed totally put out)  I had a box and some international money as well in my hand  The first thing he says is ""We don't do money here""  So I was immediately put off and said I'd go ahead and leave  He kind of backtracked and stumbled on his words and told me he'd look at what I had (Which is a 1ct solitaire diamond ring and 2 14k bands)  So reluctantly I gave them to him to look at  After some kind of joke method he said he'd offer me $200 for all 3 $200 I asked him why he thought that was reasonable and that the diamond alone is worth 10 times that  He said he didn't include the diamond (whatever that means what the hell did he think I was there for) and that there is a more complicated process for that but I could expect a ""little"" increase in value  A little I then pulled out an appraisal for the diamond alone from 1991 stating a value of $2400 and told him to have a terrible day  Oh and this guy's tag said something like ""Store Manager in Training""So basically if you want to get a joke of an offer (JOKE) and/or totally ripped off and robbedthis is your place  Meanwhile I'll search for a more reputable dealer."
2746,1,We are big fans of OTFMWe had been going to the Phoenix Downtown Market on Saturdays for a year + now & love it It's just a bit of a hike for us We also participated in Maya's Farm's CSA the last go around & have been missing our market visitsWell we've been going religiously to OTFM now for some time & pretty much cannot miss itIt just continues to get better & better (and more & more crowded)McClendon Farms has a big spread there & the produce is awesome They have enough variety that we don't even have to supplement produce purchases with supermarket visits at allMy other favorite thing about OTFM is that they have GREAT foodHighlights for me:-Payton Curry is typically there (some representative of Digestif always is) & has killer dishes We've had awesome chili wonderful frittatas & even fresh hand pulled mozzarella with bagna cauda (which is probably our new favorite find of the past several months)-Tracey Dempsey (desert genius of assorted Kasperski spots) is there & has wonderful creations She typically has a great offering from Cowboy Ciao as well-Chrysa Kaufman & Rancho Pinot are there showcasing McClendon produce Whatever they have flat out rocks I've had amazing sandwiches there every time unbelievable bean & sausage soup & about 50 glasses of meyer lemonade (the kids help)The other absolute must for us is the bread by the Phoenician folks They have a chocolate cherry sourdough which is insane Pairs wonderfully with red wine & coffee (so it's easy to do twice in a day) Their other breads are awesome tooThat's enough for me to already be a win I absolutely love that the chefs of some of the great local independent spots were there chatting & interacting with the community Makes me doubly want to patronize their restaurants It seems as if the chefs are pairing up with local farms as wellOther faves: -The tamale folks from Downtown Market are there with their excellent product Unfortunately they don't focus much on food sales on the spot but more on frozen packets for home  We love their tamales (especially their chicken/mole)-There is a hot dog stand using Vienna Beef & doing Chicago style dogs with sport peppers celery salt & all Food is good but be prepared to wait-There is also an interesting looking huge BBQ smoker which I need to try Heard it was great from some folks we talked to-Maya's Farm is there Produce looked great-There was an interesting vegan desert stall which was quite yummy that we'll be checking out more closely as well (dairy/egg allergic kids)-Several artisan bread stallsAnd throughout the day they also have live music which gives it a nice vibeWas bummed Tortillas Rosario isn't there any longer Hopefully they'll return as they were there early on Excited that Seacat Gardens will also be coming back soonHave also heard Sweet Republic will have a presence soon which we'll be totall psyched forFresh eggs are scarce We've been too late but have heard that Maya & the goat lady have eggs Definitely something that they need more ofThey also do the write your order down on a card & go pay at a central location type thing like Downtown Phoenix Market as well but there are a couple vendors who only take cashIf you need it there is an ATM just north of 1st street on Brown (west side of the street) - I needed itAnyway for us it's by far our favorite farmers market in town.
294,1,i stayed here on business a few weeks ago my employer didn't make reservations for a me and a couple of my co-workers so on the day we were supposed to stay the front desk agent who took our reservation was accommodating and helped us reserve our rooms when we checked in the agent was also very nice she explained breakfast and checked us into rooms near each other this spring hill suites is very nice and well kept it's quiet and located in a great area (close to arizona mills) the only thing that was unpleasant was the light shining in my room all night while i tried to sleep this is entirely my fault because i did not check to see if the curtains were black out curtains wish i would have known would have gotten way better sleep hahahaha.
1060,0,"I have very little faith in chain restaurantsPanda Express lunch was really badNoodles - overcooked choppy wasted flavorlessI chose a ""Grilled Chicken"" which was 70% chicken fat bits with a few pieces of some kind of breast or muscle like tissue  Grilled steak something with some vegetable was leatherIts just not goodFact is there ain't nothing good to eat in 85027 unfortunately."
3836,0,Horrible  Dirty run down the employees didn't know their butt fromwell you know  The taco meat had NO flavor I told the kid behind the counter and he just looked at us with his mouth hanging open and shrugged his shoulders  There were flies everywhere The floors were dirty  Both restrooms were filthy ( and for my husband to say a men's bathroom is bad it has to be bad) Never ever have I had such an icky taco bell experience  Will go back to stoping at Carl's jr or jack in the box on the way thru town  Icky Just icky.
2155,1,Scale of 100 (multiple visits):n/a Food10 **Drinks**10 Service9 Atmosphere7 ValueThis new bar spot was just opened by the owners of the next-door Breadfruit restaurant (Jamaican food)  Same as their restaurant everything here is amazing qualityThey also punched a walkway into the wall between the two places so you can order Breadfruit food over in the RumBar as wellVerdict: over 70 quality rums (working up to 108) = YES**NOTE: Their grand opening isn't until Jan 27th  Until then they are still playing with hours & drink recipes so during this time all drinks are only $6**.
3133,0,"I was actually really disappointed I grew up going to D&B in Texas when I'd visit my family there and absolutely loved the place but the locale at Tempe Marketplace would kind of a let down I definitely wouldn't grade their food an A it was decent but I mean it's 'playground' for kids and big kids alike I suppose so you're not necessarily going for the foodBut the cleanliness was horrible I walked into the womans bathroom and almost every stall was clogged/or cluttered as if it had been TP'd by a bunch of childrenOur waiter was a great help and super nice but when I approached someone on the management staff in regards to the untidy bathroom the mans response was ""Don't worry about it we have someone on it""  I was seriously a bit taken back at his response and it rubbed me the wrong way Don't think I'll be making another trip back anytime soon."
2208,1,The Boulders is the premiere resort in the Scottsdale area  The Latilla Room offers wonderful food with human sized portions - a rarity in Cowboy land  Also the wine list is extraordinary & offers good value.
2644,1,Who doesn't love a good dive bar The Rusty Spur is awesome If you haven't been here you need to go ASAP This place always has live music and they take suggestions from the crowd which is fun It's tiny in there but I think it adds to the atmosphere There's all sorts of fun things all over the walls that are cool to look at and the drinks are cheap I would be really shocked if you didn't have a good time here even if you aren't that into country music It's just very western/old school Arizona feeling and a fun change from the rest of the bars in Old Town (it's also sort of away from the rest of the bars) When I graduated from college my dad my stepmom and I all went to Saba's bought boots put them on and walked over to Rusty Spur to get our drink on I highly suggest you do the same ).
482,0,Loved this place when it first opened Ate there several times a week Last time it looked  and tasted like cafeteria or airplane food Won't be returning.
2001,1,Love it  Have been going here for years and they have never disappointed  YUM.
2416,0,Very dissappointed Had the Loca la vida the salsa that came with it was the most disgusting thing I have ever tasted I mentioned it to the waitress and she said that others had made the same comment Well maybe you shouldn't serve it then Hello OJ was good but Expensive $295 for a lrge OJ.
1532,0,This food is NOT MEXICAN everything is grease and nasty with no flavor This place is only good for drinking beer.
2448,1,If you are looking for top-notch produce and organic goodies then NGD is the best Pricing can't be beat and it's delivered as well Always great quality and a large selection Easy ordering process and awesome customer service One of the reasons I am sad not to live in Scottsdale anymore.
603,1,Coconut shrimp are awesome scallop potatoes great Steaks are great too Salads too Large portions Great ambiance like a classy mountain lodge Great staff I was impressed all of the food coming out of the open grill kitchen looked awesome.
3446,0,Horrible stay Decided to stay here after surgery to recover and relax Awful beds I slept worse here than in the hospital Upgraded to a nicer room upon check in but I reaped zero benefits from that Called the front desk multiple times to get reg coffee for the coffee maker and they told me that I needed to go to the restaurant if I wanted that They never replaced the toilet paper in the room so i resorted to using kleenex The hotel claims to be a 4 star establishment but in actuality it is just a spoofed up motel I will never stay here again and I am beyond disappointed by this establishment and the staff.
4995,0,"The food was meh at best the service was deplorable I ordered the chicken fried steak breakfast First the biscuits came out when they served my fiancé his dinner Then came the steak and part of the eggs The remain egg and hash browns came out By the time I was served my fiancé was nearly finished  Our waitress left us sitting there long after we had finished eating When I asked for a to go box she took my plate and didn't return for quite a while When she came back she asked if I wanted a box for my biscuits I asked where the rest of my meal was and could see immediately on her face she had thrown it away She then said ""I thought you only wanted a box for the biscuits"" which made no sense She then left hurriedly and said she would adjust the bill but I would have gladly paid the extra $6 to leave Both she and the manager said that they hadn't scheduled a cook and 2 waiters The waitress said she was triple booked at her station  I don't see this as the waitresses issue but it seemed more like a lot of bad management decisions What kind of manager has an all you can eat fish fry on a Friday night and doesn't have all of his staff working This was our fist and last visit to BBD."
3651,0,The repair man said i needed a new unit I told him I wanted the same kind They hung it then he said oh your Key pad outside  Does't want to work with your new unit Its 7000 more for the key pad OK fine Then at night when i went out to get into the car there was no lights and the belt is hanging and they rod bends when it closesI called and let them know and she told me that was extra for the sensor  and when I told the Women on the phone that I wanted it done today she got very rude with meand Hung up on me  I have to wait another week beucz I work I see at least 150 people in my place of business and I will NEvER refer themAnd I will make sure i tell every client about them.
1541,1,Oh Cowboy Ciaohow I miss thee It doesn't better than a Stetson Chopped and a glass of wine Oh and the mushroom pan fry and desserts aren't bad either.
3351,0,They didn't fully honor the oil change coupon discount told me I needed a lot of stuff that I didn't need which I declined They didn't seem trustworthy the next day I found a screw in the driver's side tire - coincidence I was getting my oil changed at Cobblestone before and will not deviate again.
972,1,I am a member of all Village Clubs and when I can't make it to Gainey I'll occasionally drop in here since I have the multi-club membership This club is immaculate Love that they have two restaurants equipment is gorgeous/new and it's relatively Centrally located in Phoenix IMHO I think there are a couple of minor issues to this club but I think it's probably due to my lack of experience here and I need to adjust to this particular locations specifics The cardio area can become very busy and you might have to wait for a machine because this location doesn't have as many machines as Gainey The men's locker is gorgeous but I feel like I need a map or GPS because it is so sprawling and I often have gotten lost Bonus for the full bar you can consume all the calories you burnt off at the full bar Besides my slight criticism this gym is awesome Group activities often that are free yoga etc Love The Village.
1471,0,Drinking water cause they got the pepsi  Food came out uncooked  slow service Server tried to tell me thats how it is  really you serve mexican food with cheese that isn't melted  No visit from a manager or anything this is a place in need of a visit from restaurant impossible  I won't be going back.
2839,1,We come here a lot for lunch Such reasonable prices (usually around $16 total with drinks) and delicious healthy vegetarian choices  Love the injira bread and all the choices We haven't tried the raw food menu much but hope to in the future Their falafel salad is great.
3140,0,This McDonalds is one of the worst I have ever been to There are always transients outside begging for money Many of them approach you at your car or follow you out of the building The food is decent but the line is always long The staff has little common sense They refuse to give you a drink cup after you have paid and make you wait until your food is ready This is especially inconvenient because of the terrible drink station layout with no where to put your food Also don't bother asking for a free cup of water They give you a cup which is smaller than what you get in a kids meal Avoid this McDonald's at every opportunity.
3350,0,Went for a free poker tournament and was quite disappointed (and disgusted) in the place  I literally STUCK to the floor  It was gross  Their carpet is nasty  The bathroom wasn't much better  I mean don't get me wrong I don't expect a lot from a sports bars but I also don't expect to stick to the floor  The waitress I had was great and the drinks were cheap and strong - but not enough so to bring me back in the future 2 thumbs down.
3682,0,Dropped my car off at 11am for a regular oil change 6 hours later not even touched They blamed it on their oil guy calling in sick So I guess their other mechanics can't change oil on cars This will probably be the last time I use Fletcher's.
4007,0,The location is terrible The building is attached to a auto mechanic shop and it's on Van Buren and 2nd Ave There is no parking so good luck with walk to and from the venue If you are over the age of 22 this is not the place for you The place is full of loud mouthed young kids and is not at a place to relax and listen to music I don't recommend the venue for adults and professionals however if you are 18 and loud mouthed this is your place Adults and professionals stick with Scottsdale Also a warning to professionals there was a heavy marijuana presence so if you need to avoid this don't attend.
3442,0,How do you go through life and try to win over new business when the first word is always NO It says bank on the outside but try to get change to break a couple twenties for coinage and was asked if I had an account there You're a BANK  Where is your customer service Great way to run of new business.
2875,1,Five star the place is well decorated I was like a kid in a candy store Love it So colorful and full of fun stuff I took a pic with the nerdy glasses The person who helped me and the cashier was very friendly I got the vietnamese coffee sandwich with chocolate chuck cookies and the molasses crisp Yumm.
3891,0,"Bad service 3 times gets you yelped Strike 3 - Recently we changed our address and they are holding a pile of mail  Since we are out of state now my tenant goes over there to retrieve the mail they are holding (3 weeks now) and they replied ""I'm not going in there now to sort through it it will be mailed to them next week"" - OH I see it takes a month for you to do it Should have taken 5 daysStrike 2 - They changed our mailbox key and gave us the wrong key  Nobody would help us until my husband had to pull the attitude card JeeshStrike 1 - I received a gift in the mail box was too big for the mailbox so they kept it at the post office no note no drop off nuthin'  I had to go track it down there it was sitting there waiting for someone to deliver it  A week they had it."
1729,1,Great food Nice Lighting Attractive bartenders Amazingly concocted martinis Love this place.
2793,1,I seriously feel guilty that I like Yogurtini so much I decided at the beginning of the summer to make it my mission to try as many froyo places as possible because I wanted to prove my never ending love for Yogurtology then I discovered Yogurtini  Now I kinda just feel like I'm cheatingNot only is Yogurtini's froyo super smooth and perfectly flavored they have angel food cake flavor  The topping bar at Yogurtini is outrageous and the atmosphere is great  Yogutini has enough seating to host large groups and they advertise free wifi which makes makes me feel like I should grab my laptop and make myself at homeYogurtini is a must try.
1722,1,Yum yum yum  My friend and I accidentally happened upon this place for lunch and we were pleasantly surprised that the food was so good  I'm not a big fan of Italian restaurants but I will definitely be heading back to this place  They have lunch combo specials where you can get pasta and a salad or pizza and a salad for $9  I had the Sicilian pizza and the Misto salad and my friend had the Pasta Rustica and the Misto salad  Everything was delicious  The crust on the pizza was delish and the sauce used in the Rustica was very fresh  They also bring out some fresh warm doughy bread with olive oil and balsamic before your meal  We also learned that every Monday and Tuesday they serve spaghetti and meatballs for only $5 -- dine-in or take out  We've already planned another trip back during happy hour so we can test out their drink selection :).
3988,0,I went to this hotel and I will NEVER stay here The female/male who was working the desk was a total bitch Plus over charge for stuff snacks Friend was staying here and she didn't like the person who was working the desk Not a welcome feeling at this hotel.
1764,0,"Oh boy  My husband needed prgressive lenses  The girl who helped () us told me we should get the ""premium"" progressive as opposed to the standard  I asked what the difference in price was and she WOULDNT TELL ME  She figured it all out nd showed my like a car salesman on a computer a price of $171  With insurance  When I said that was a lot she said we should get insurance on the glasses for another $30  Good luck with that sister   I later found out the standard progressive is $75 with our insurance We walked and ordered the same glasses online from zinni for a grand total of $61 without using insurrance  Hold on to the wallet here folks."
4319,0,Today I called the office about my AC It wasn't working at all And it took them 5hrs to respond But they just came and fixed the AC but they didn't changed the filters So I called the office for some filters and the management told me they ran out of it but I have to get my own Not so good And last week our bathroom was flooded and they didn't know where the water came from However if your rent is short for only 23cents they will charged you a $100 after a week All I can say is the management don't know how to treat people DO NOT MOVE HERE.
3137,0,Hey we know what we're getting with Filiberto's cheap Mexican grub in large quantities Some Filiberto's are clean and somewhat nice this location definitely isn't one of them  The dining room was dark grimey and dingy the tables are too high for the bench seats and whats with only turning on a single light in the entire space  The restaurant had a weird odor ( I probably don't want to know what it was) and our food was all extremely over cooked probanly spending an entire day under the warming lights because most people have abandoned this location  Every single thing in the restaurant was worn out and dirty Time to spend a few bucks on a rehab or close this dump down What a waste of a meal.
3109,0,Water is shut off at first monthly then biweekly now weekly and off for hours No notice is given Pools look terrible green with algae never are the two pools open at the same time Over this past summer the pools were closed on a weekly basis One may be open for a few days and then locked up again for another few days to a week The washer/dryers on each floor has at least one of them broken or one of each broken Management in the office never seem to know what's going on but one of the ladies she is a sweetheart Maintenance NEVER come by when they say they are your lucky if it's the same week you called Elevators are always broken or need repairs guests are always stuck in them for an hour to hours long Fire department has been called a few times to open/help the ones stuck in them Our AC was shut off for 1 1/2 days during 110° days If yours want to live here it's at your own risk the hassle is not worth the headache.
361,1,On average I go here MINIMUM 1X a weekalready been there 2X in the last 3 days so that tells you what a regular I am  Have met the owner multiple times and he's super friendly and always remembers us  They change flavors regularly and the flavors are SOOO yummy  You can even get ones with no sugar in them that are delicious (chocolate dipped strawberrieshad it tonightgreat)  Their website has all of the weight watchers points too which is kind of nice  Their toppings are the best - fresh fruits AND some of your standard stuff (M&M's cookie dough sprinkles etc)  Great ambience and the teenagers that work there are always friendly  Glad to have Yo Love in our neighborhood.
3462,0,Absolutely terrible The staff was unfriendly the whole experience was awkward and the food WAS TERRIBLE Both mine and my friend'sThere was one girl there at lunch timeAll the food was cold and was NOT FRESH at all Plus it was WAY too expensive for what you got Can't say terrible enough I feel nausea coming on just thinking about it Sorry PachucaI know business is tough and bad reviews suck but you need to step it up big time The place is pretty inside and COULD be awesome.
2331,1,"Went here last night for happy hour (M-F 5-7)  They have a bunch of alcohol specials but we stuck to wine  It was 1/2 off all their glasses  They have some decent selections with nothing to crazy or expensive  I recommend their ""keg"" size pours which are 9 ounces versus the regular 6  3 of those equals a bottle FYIFor food they don't really have anything special on their happy hour menu so we ordered off the regular bar menu*seared tuna = excellent*sliders = very good*sirloin Caesar  = pretty good but I think it is over priced at $15I also had like 2 bowls of those chips  OMFG they are so goodThe service was surprising fast and friendly  I'm used to happy hours where it takes forever to get food and drinks and waitstaff that are flusteredI will be back but I do think they need some better selections on their happy hour menu food wise  It also wouldn't hurt to have a normal martini or other vodka based drink on the happy hour menu."
980,1,My husband works close to the area and we are scouting out a move to the area so I've really been happy to see what they are doing here It's reminiscent of outdoor shopping centers like Desert Ridge It seems like about 1/2 the shops seems to be open and that new things are opening each week The nice thing is that the stores here don't seem expansive and huge just because they have the space As such it's decently close to us (although there are other places to shop that are closer) but it has a nice mix of shops and such that I think I'll be making the drive a bit more often.
4795,0,Taste like trashy Unbelieve when I ate tamales and found excessive salt not fresh and oily I refuse to come to this lousy restaurant again.
1686,1,This review update is for the food only  I ordered the short rib since I had not eaten a thing all day so a hardy dish was what I was craving  OMG  I never would have imagined how good it would be  The short rib melted in your mouth  The Parmesan bread pudding was wonderful  A little on the salty side but I LOVE salt.
950,1,Very spacious and clean They have two train that ride around the park I think I like riding on it even more than my daughter They also have a carousel two playgrounds and two snack shops I rate this the number 1 park in Phoenix.
2189,1,I've been in Arizona since 1984 and have never found a cheesesteak or hoagie as authentic as Philly's famous  I'm here at least once a month Megan and her family always make me feel welcomed and truly appreciate their customers Went to a new place in mesa today and it was supposedly authentic and I was not impressed  Didn't even have sweet peppers I'll keep making the drive to get a real cheesesteak or hoagie.
1742,0,Absolutely horrid We ordered here because of a flier on our door and they deliver The main dishes were ok it's hard to mess up sweet and sour and teriyaki The fried rice was the worst I've ever had I can't believe they even choose to send this out The crab puffs were hard and soggy at the same time and the filling was just Philadelphia cream cheese alone The eggs rolls had a tolerable texture but were almost bitter in taste After waiting for over an hour for delivery this meal was terribly disappointing We will never order here again.
943,1,"Weather & Coffee is now closed They locked the doors last week without any warning I've heard a few things but don't know what's what so I won't say anything But here's the official line from their website:""Weather & Coffee has served the best coffee tea smoothies & pastries for almost three years We are proud of our products and services and have enjoyed serving our customers Sadly we have had to close down our Bell Road location The rigors of being open 7 days a week is one of the many factors in our decision But now we will have more time to devote to our family and elderly parents""It's a shame to see another small business owner go out of business Support Local Buy Local."
2305,1,"""When do you need the shirts by""""How soon can you make 'em We got a game tonight at 9""Concerned look on Shane's face ""I'm pretty sure I can do that""He did I needed five shirts for my league team with a big logo on the back and different numbers on the front I went into the shop around 4:30 PM and got a call around 8 PM saying the shirts would be ready by 8:30 I cut it close but the man delivered Shane was very friendly and helpful I got a 10% discount for ordering a ""quantity""I brought the tees to my team and they all loved the shirts They dug the design the PE Shirt style material and the fit Oh and by the way we won all three games of our match that night I'll be going back to Brand X."
2943,1,Why did I give this place 5 stars  Cuz of the 50 cent Coronas Delicious.
2814,1,Famous Dave's serves up the best barbeque in town without a doubt The staff are friendly the ribs are to die for and the desserts (if you make it that far) are simply awesome The feasts on the clean trashcan lid are good value if you have a large number of people in your party and offer you a sampling of some of the best items on the menu If in doubt though try the St Louis ribs I've had them often and have never been disappointed.
1854,0,Don't eat here unless you want to become violently ill  My boyfriend made the mistake of eating the salsa that was sitting out on the table  Now I have the joy of taking care of him because he has a really bad case of food poisoning as a result  Great way to ruin a vacation.
1982,1,Great hidden gem for vegetarians + the best service in town While we veggie folk know that most Asian places will substitute tofu for any dishes in lieu of meat we also know it is hard to find a place where the tofu isn't a crappy tasting substitute that they don't really want to serve  This is not the case at Ling and Louie's The fried tofu in just about everything and in every sauce is delicious I kick it way up the spicy meter with 2 or 3 dishes of chili paste and mix that in with my (off the menu) Evil Jungle Tofu It is so good that I am actually happy that the portions are too large for me to finish I can nosh on this dish all night  well after I've left the restaurant I'm a pretty simple beer and whiskey drinker but I my wife loves the great drinks that they make here They come in blue red purple and green  I don't know what's in them but she loves themThe servers treat you like family and are always extra nice to our little one They don't put a hot plate in front of a 2 year old like most restaurants and have a vast selection of items for the mini me in your life The staff is always quick to grab a high chair a few crayons and a fun kids menu  Every time I've been it's busy  but not uncomfortably so We're always sat quickly and never rushed The decor is cool and it's casual enough for the entire family and nice enough to impress a date Don't miss out on this one A real 5 out of 5 - Jason -.
4367,0,service awful menu changed  They charge for onions and peppers in potatoes there cream of corn is awful there is an herb in it and they do not tell you what it is and they say they do not know  Also there is no bread basket you have to ask for it the food portions like pork chops has no bone it is small and the augratin potatoes is white not baked and awful.
1357,1,Great location quick drive thru and friendly service  This store is BIG and has been renovated  It's a great location to study read have a meeting or just enjoy a cup of coffee and relax  It's on the corner so the location is convenient to get to  If you love starbucks stop by this one for sure.
2125,1,"I love this place  I bought my car used in Phoenix and had it shipped to SF  Arcadia Car Wash took care of the detailing before it was shipped over and when my car arrived it looked brand new  Several of my friends even commented that my car had ""new car"" smell and were shocked when I told them my car was used  If I lived in Phoenix I would be a very regular customer."
4127,0,Wont be coming back Taking some movies back to blockbuster we decided to stop by here for pizza This is a delivery/take out only location so we ordered for takeout I've been doing low-carb diet so I ordered a Buffalo Chicken salad and a pizza for the kids It came up to nearly $40 for take-out for a large pizza and a salad We get the food home and the salad looks like a dinner side salad Mainly iceberg lettuce with a couple tomatoes and a few thick strips of cheddar cheese on top My wife goes back to tell them we ordered a buffalo chicken salad and they send her back home with a few chicken strips No buffalo sauce in sight Not spicy If I wanted to eat iceberg lettuce with some microwave chicken strips I would have done that at home for about $2 instead of paying nearly $13 While waiting for my wife to get back I ate a few slices of the pizza despite my low-carb diet and got indigestion before even finishing threw up by bed time and spent the next day feeling ill at work My daughter and son who ate the pizza are also sick today Will not be going back that's for sure.
2091,1,OMG THE CREAMY RICE I can't get over how delicious it truly is some blend of white rice sour cream grilled onions and magical unicorn horns or something because it is awesome I always get the Chicken Fajita Rice Bowl and it's great every time The chicken is always tender and perfectly cooked the vegetables are greatand now we all know how I feel about the riceI've heard their fish tacos are to-die-for as well but I've never had the opportunity to try them because I'm so loyal to my beloved rice bowl The ambiance is super cute too this is just a great place for a quick bite to eat or for takeout The counter people/runners are always very friendly and helpfulsometimes almost too helpful We had one food runner who loitered near our table the whole meal and kept asking us if we needed anything it got to be a bit much - but that's okay I'd much prefer that to being neglected as customers so often are these daysThe Deluxe/Zen 32 folks have another winner.
2405,1,We went to The Farm today for lunch to enjoy a picnic on such an awesome beautiful day I had the Tuscan sandwich and it was awesome I had expected it to be good but was surprised at just how enjoyable it really was I'm sure sitting outside in beautiful surroundings on a perfect day helped with the experience This is the prefect place for lunch on a beautiful day My date was equally impressed so I'm sure I will be back.
2085,1,I can't say enough about this great spot We were here for drinks and cookies (made next door) Even though this place is always busy it doesn't take us long to check out Everything is 5 star.
3608,0,First warning would be that any rest that is completely empty at 7:30pm on a Thursday means the food is not good The service was great but the food was a miss I paid $19 for the 'short ribs' which actually was 4 tiny slices of overcooked meat The rest of my party's dinner seemed average at best The biggest problem is that my credit card was charged twiceI spoke with Eric the manager once after it happened but to date no credit back I would have been willing to pay for the meal but I don't want to pay for that now either I guess they need to get $ however they can.
3937,0,We recently called from the office for delivery from Flaming Kabob and that was a flaming mistake  The pitas were pita-ful the 'fresh' juices a watery mess and the fries were actually melted into their plastic container  I have no experience of eating inside the restaurant and am unlikely to do so after this disaster.
4910,0,"So a friend of mine went here last Friday and they were double charged  The bartender took advantage of the situation and threw out the receipt to avoid cancelling the $60 amount Which she claims and assumes was her tip (on a $60 bill) ""I get a 100% tips"" ummyeah I think I will skip this place for sure."
1770,1,came to this place after being recommended by my mom and sistersi have had a difficulty time finding a dependable and quality nail salon in scottsdale/tempe area i finally found onethey did a SUPERB gel manicure and pedicure they really take care and time in their work and the customer service is incredible competitive prices as welli will be returning -- best nail salon i've been to by far.
3805,0,"Went in to have my ankle looked at after experiencing a lot of pain and some swelling While I was waiting in the room I could hear the doctor say ""we sure do have some needy patients today don't we"" Somebody needs to learn that those walls aren't sound proof  It took about 20 minutes for the doctor to finally see me and when she did all she did was move my ankle around with her foot and told me there was nothing wrong She didn't even have me remove my shoe to really inspect it I will never go here again."
1353,1,I love shopping at this store I always get great dresses that are comfy and decently priced They also have a great selection of preowned clothes in the back too The acessories and fab as well I love their selection of earrings and someone they work with or know makes these awesome leather cuffs They have paintings incense candles and so much more They ladies that work there are great helpers while shopping and super nice to talk to as well.
969,1,WarningI am not a burger person  I do not love burgers and I do not look for new burger joints to open up  I still haven't been to Five Guys  So when I say this is the best burger I've ever had please take it with a grain of salt  BUTthe Delux is the BEST burger I have ever had  Honestly it had me at gruyère cheese  Everything is perfect on this burger  It's non-traditional and I love it  And can I please get an AMEN on the sweet potato fries  I have tried soo many sweet potato fries at other restaurants hoping they will be as good as these and I have yet to find any  I have no idea what they do with these fries maybe they fry them in sugar oil I have no idea what makes them great but you MUST get an order of themYes they are busy and the place is small and loud  I've always gotten excellent service They have a great beer selectionthey even have my favorite Hoegaarden  And for that reason alone I would give them 5 stars.
79,1,Ted's is one of the few hot dog joints where the hot dogs actually are better than the pricier sausages But don't get me wrong everything they serve is good I first had Ted's when I was 8 years old and it remains my favorite dog in Arizona Every weiner is perfectly charred over coals And the onion rings are battered and wonderful more like an Awesome Blossom than breaded frozen fast food rings.
3092,0,"While the beans are tasty as other reviewers have said (they use lard in them mmm mmm) and the portion sizes generous I just can't recommend you eat here based on the fact I found out they fry their nachos and probably by extension other things using the fryer in hydrogenated oil You can ""feel"" it on the nachos as they have a waxy coating when cooledI know not everyone knows or perhaps cares about the deathly spectre of hydro-oils (most commonly referred to as trans fats) but believe me: they're highly dangerousIt's a damn shame too as most of the offerings at this place seem solid and they even have three-person mariachi bands at the ready to serenade you In my short time in PHX this looked like it was going to be the best Mexican place I had found yet Oh well back to the drawing board."
1138,1,Food was great and service was absolutely awesome  Best ever  Thanks Lauren.
1057,0,"The pizza was absolutely delicious as expected and the mozzarella was dreamy However the treatment we received horrible   We had never been before  so my husband and I ordered a pizza to share  since we are not big eaters It was clearly not enough So get thiswe tried to order another pizza and were told ""no there are too many people waiting"" We were given are check and the table was cleared  I don't care how good your pizza is You can lump it for such rude behavior I would rather get a Dominoe's Death Disk before I would return."
2676,1,Really good food in a cute setting  I like how the restaurant is set up in little rooms  (It is a house after all)  That makes for a more intimate quieter meal  The omakase dinner was not available the night I went so we ordered off the menu  The hamachi with grapefruit was awesome as were the soft shell shrimp & green papaya slaw (great for snacking with a glass of cold beer)  But the star of the night was definitely the pork belly buns  Finally a creative way to eat pork belly  The soft white buns complemented the fat from the pork belly very well  Parking was actually note that bad since the restaurant offers validation for the parking structure next door  Pricing is also reasonable for the quality of food  This is an all-around winner  I can't wait to go back.
1975,1,This place is like half movie theatre half bizzaro museum It's worth going to just for the weird statues and creepy wax figures that stare at you from every corner The movies are only three bucks so you can't beat that The theaters themselves are okay nothing fancy for sure and sometimes the sound quality isn't the best But hey it's three bucksI figure I'm paying $150 for the movie and a $150 for the entertainment of the statuesI just wish Pollack would open up a museum of his whole collection I hear he has a ton of stuff I wanna see it.
3280,0,Not sure how this place has gotten any good reviews on here  Food is bad service is slow and it is on the expensive side for Mexican food  I always go to a restaurant three times before I will post a negative review on here because everyone has off days  This place was the same experience  all three times   I won't be going a fourth time.
4338,0,"BUYER BEWARE  After having this company out to my home to repair a garage door (which due to lack of communication within the company resulted unnecessarily in multiple visits from different technicians to my homeeach technician providing us with different information than the prior as to the extent of repair necessary) we discovered that 3 tactical weapon knives were suddenly missing after the final technician's visit  We immediately notified the business owner  After multiple phone calls to the owner he finally responded that ""you have no proof or evidence that my guys took them""  I notified the owner that I am filing a formal (under perjury of law) police report about this incident and filing complaints with all relevant licensing/consumer agencies BUYER BEWARE."
4525,0,A little late to the party  I was able to convince my father to get out of this house for what looked to be a great time and great food  What a DISASTER  The prior reviews are dead on  We were so excited to savor the tastings of food trucks but obviously so was the entire population of Scottsdale  Lines lasted for hours trucks ran out of food and everyone was grumpy  Not impressed.
1256,0,"Never GO HERE EVER First they robbed me of 150 dollars for a straight year until one day I decided to call after finding the receipt of the shoes I returned in an old bag even after everything my ""check"" got lost in the mail  and never got sent So I had to go out of my way to pick up my money that was suppose to be returned to me one year ago."
1053,1,What a difference a year has made here  Since Landry's has purchased Morton's the menu has grown into many options for you to choose from  The addition of the Mixed Grills The 4 layer Chocolate Cake ( which is homemade) Shredded Steak tacos and a fantastic happy hour how can you go wrong  Service is still top notch and the new music adds to a less stuffy environment  We celebrated a special occasion with some friends and we were greeted with a personalized menu and an unexpected raspberry souffle  Nice touch  We will definitely be back.
1951,1,Had a wonderful time great food got to see friends there this morning and very decent prices :).
988,1,You can't go wrong at this place the burger was great (best burger in town) the fries were delicious the onion rings were ok they even had PBR for $3  Plus there's always a good group of customers and staff inside and the music selection is great.
4126,0,"Had my first and last dining experience at Liberty MarketI agree with another comment I read below cafeteria-style service should include cafeteria-style prices  The food was just ok and I did not appreciate paying lots of cash for what I had for lunch  (A very small salad with thinly sliced deli turkey on top)I also see lots of comments about their ""awesome"" bathroom  Really  Who cares about the bathroomSuggestion:  Go to Joe's BBQ directly across the street or if it's breakfast you are in downtown Gilbert for go next door to The Farmhouse  Hands Down Blows Liberty Market away."
4593,0,We planned ahead to have dinner here and made reservations the for 6:15 PM before going to the 7:30 PM showing of Dreamgirls at the MAC Arrived around 6:20 and was seated immediately The place was crowded and the service seemed to be a bit slow We all ready knew what we wanted so we ordered our meal at 6:30 PM My wife and I sat and conversed over hot Jasmine tea Some time had past and the server came to our table and told us that it would be another 10 minutes before our order would be ready and do we want to wait I looked at the time and it was 7:10 I told him 'NO void our ticket So we got up and left for the theatre If they were on Top Chef I would have told them to 'pack your knives and LEAVE'The food is excellent there but if you can't produce in a timely manner then WHY even openI think their problem is that they possible have one chef and when the restaurant is crowded there is NO WAY they can keep the patrons HAPPYThere was a another table with two ladies and they were able to eat just the appetizerI hope the owners of the restaurant are reading these comments from YELP because they have to open their eyes to see they are above the heads and NEED to hire another CHEF in the kitchenIf there was an option of ZERO stars that's what I would have rated them.
4050,0,worse excuse for beef noodle soup  just disappointingsoup was off-flavor nothing close to Taiwanesenoodles were soggy meat was overcooked like you left it in the broth cooking for awhile.
564,1,It was a pleasant surprise to find that they serve local and organic foods  I ordered the organic grass fed burger and It was great cooked perfect and the service was wonderful  I don't normally order desert but when I saw they had bread pudding I said what the heck  It was by far the best bread pudding I've ever had and I will definitely be back to have it again.
1893,0,Horrible Rude the minute he saw my coupon  Massage didn't even last 2 minutes Not friendly what so ever - go elsewhere.
25,1,great place to go  i was able to get a same-day appt and the doctor was so nice and great  at what he does i'd definitely recommend.
4885,0,Be prepared to be upset it is gone has been for several years now.
3589,0,Stayed here one night went to a seminar and decided to come back  Wasn't terrible for the price  Upon checking back in we realized they didn't change the sheets on the bed because there were some marks on the ones from the previous night that were still there so they were never changed even though we checked out with no intention on coming back  They cut corners here that normally would get missed by customers  This is completely unsanitary and disgusting  We even had to change our own sheets they were delivered to the room from they guy that checked us in the office  There is no housekeeping here.
2289,1,Love hummus falafel gyros and the like Come here You can taste the freshness Pita Jungle is good but this is much much better Come here to get your Greek food fix especially if you live/work nearby in Scottsdale Ranch or by the hospital Despite being hidden in strip mall by Quizno's Starbucks and Chipotle it is a real gem Good service too Support small business in Scottsdale.
4233,0,I love Red Lobster's endless shrimp and delicious biscuits however I'm sitting here writing this review at my table because I've been here for an hour and a half so far and have yet to get my food Drink refills are impossible to obtain because our server can't figure it out In fact he disappears for 20 minutes at a time without resurfacing from behind the kitchen doors I couldn't even leave if I wanted to because I can't get my check I'll update my review with food reviews if our food ever arrives.
1603,1,Was in Arizona this past week and hit up Pho Nhat still AWESOME The 
2613,1,So amazingly delicious  Every time I go there I have to get the of course chicken and waffles  And my boyfriend and I share a side of home fries which are just the potatoes are crisp on the outside and fluffy on the inside and seasoned to perfection  Someday I will branch out and try their other menu items I'm sure you can't go wrong no matter what you order herePro tip:  Make sure you bring your appetite.
2115,1,This is my favorite restaurant  Their chicken mole is SO GOOD  The papa con carne chili relleno and fish tacos are amazing as well  NOTE:  The Taqueria's are not as good as this the original restaurant  The quality of the food is not even close  I recently moved to another state but whenever I come to town to visit family they know that a trip to Tia Rosa will happen  I have to get my chicken mole fix :)  And I love the atmosphere of the restaurant and during the winter we always eat ourside especially at Christmas when it's decorated  Try this place atleast once  Don't get the usual chimichanga or tacos try one of their specialty dishes and you'll enjoy your visit so much more  ENJOY.
1554,1,Awesome paletas you can ask my son lol.
2550,1,French toast - NO BRAINER It's INSANE Tip: get one slice for a $1 more when added to an omelette That's plenty it's like eating dessert for breakfast it's so rich And spend the extra $1 for real maple syrup Five egg white omelette - pleasantly surprised that it was light and fluffyOatmeal with bananas and pecans with a nice selection of toppings Fresh squeezed OJ - a rarityThey have full range a decadently delicious fried french toast and perfectly made egg white omelette.
4031,0,Normally I love this place but today management failed They were understaffed to a criminal degree which is bad for employees and patrons Its not like the Derby came as a surpriseNever coming back for a special event here I did go to the 7th St and Union Hills location for Preakness and had a MUCH better experience Get your act together on 16th St and I could be persuaded to try again.
2310,1,This was a YELP guided breakfast stop on our Spring Training week food tour I trust YELPers to guide me to the best places and they always come through They were right on about the wait Mid week around 9am and there was about a 30 minute wait with lots of people waiting outside the tiny little restaurant Luckily we were just a 2 waiting for a seat as opposed to the party of 9 who would have to be broken up or wait for hours to be seated (HINT HINT not a place for groups 2 is ideal 3-4 is max unless you do not care about sitting together)Having been on day four of greasy high caloric breakfasts I opted for the steel cut oatmeal with the raisins and brown sugar and an OJ SG got standard egg plate with eggs toast ham and rosemary potatoes SG was very happy when his plate arrived The large piece of ham and the delicious rosemary potatoes set this place aside in his mind My oatmeal was very good but my humungous raisins put it over the top The service was great and Matt himself was even there helping out SG said this is how a breakfast place should be done and this is the model he would use for his own breakfast place (that will most likely never happen) The menu is limited but offers the usuals There is special attention paid to those things like the potatoes and the raisins that makes this place special Check it out Expect a wait bring a news paper.
3519,0,So there's no negative stars too bad Tried ordering take out before actually eating there to try it - good thing you couldn't pay me to eat hereThe only thing about the Colossal Cobb salad I ordered was the price $10 and change for lettuce just enough to cover the bottom of the styrofoam with a sprinkle of toppings Where'd they get their chef Chili's What a disappointment All the reviews say ' a lot of food' for who an infantI had also ordered a couple of carmelized cookies as well Didn't know deep fried greasy discs of oatmeal harder than concrete were called 'cookies' Good grief the bakery wasn't even good Had to spit those things out before they took out a filling The only good thing about Chandler Chompie's is Jason's Deli right next door.
3429,0,"Oh  The Jade BarYears ago I was a regular here  I spent many hours sitting at the bar or out on the patio  I grew up in Paradise Valley  Most of my friends still live there or near to there  I found the Jade Bar in 2002 or 2003 and it quickly became my meeting place for friends out of town guests and business associates  Back then we would go there with out a moments notice  The bar was always fully stocked with great Vodkas Great wines and one hell of a beer selection  The bartenders knew how to take care of you  They were quick to make you a drink and had a meaningful conversation while they did itThen it all changed  One day we came in as a group of 8  It was humiliating to say the least  My friends and business associates waited 10  20 minutes for a drink  One of my friends ordered one of their most popular drinks and it came out the wrong color  It wasn't even the right drink - Since that experience we rarely go back A good friend of mine lives at the base of the mountain he frequents the Jade Bar regularly  But even he will admit ""it is only because its the best choice for a nearby drink""  I have gone there with him on a few occasions and I am disgusted by the attitude you receive by the staff  I am disgraced by the lack of concern for their customers  It literally took them at least 10 minutes to get me a beer Honestly I do not know what happened  And it makes me mad  Because I loved that barSo fast forward to end of 2012I struggled with the idea of even going back there But my girl friend insisted that we go  I have to admit that I had a preconceived notion of how it would go  Well I was right  We showed up and found a table sat down and waited  We waited long enough for me to ask my GF twice to leave  The waitress showed up and was quick to ask us what we wanted but then was just as quick to walk away when we didn't know  I eventually got drinks from the bar  Wow  What a mess  One bartender wouldn't even look at me he was knee deep in bottles and other crap  I got a drink for my GF and I had a beer  This cost me about $23  They push this idea that they are so great with their MIXOLOGY but honestly they look like fools  I work from time to time in San Fransisco and I have seen real MIXOLOGY bars  This is not one of themBig deal $23  Not really considering the lack of attention lack of concern and lack of customer service  Back in 2003 I would of had $100 dollar tabs and not cared  I would spend the money and Tip big  I have never written a Yelp Review  As a matter of fact most places I just don't care enough  But this place went from best bar to the worst barMy friend just told me they are renovating the bar to make it bigger  This humors me because the last few times I have been there it was pretty apparent their clientele is slowing down  It used to be packed now it is pretty vacant because they can not make drinks fast enough  So I guess my final thought is this you can have the best location in the world and the best looking bar but a structure is just a structure without good people you are nothing but an illusion."
2842,1,Wow Laura is awesome I read the yelp reviews and then called her to get a lash tint She LOVES what she does and she is spot on at giving you what you want Her prices are reasonable and she is very accommodating with busy schedules I'm sold.
2287,1,I took the pole dance aerobics class last night and man am i feeling it today everyone there was really welcoming and had great advice for me as ive never tried this kind of thing before it's tucked away and at first i had no clue where it was but its worth the search had a blast got a great work out and felt great afterwards im definitely going back for more.
2583,1,The food at this place is so amazing   I can't wait to go back  I had the salmon pasty and it was a real joy to the mouth  There were 6 in our party and all of us were very happy with our food  My pasty was so large I could only eat half YEAH I get to have the other half tomorrow for lunch.
2436,0,BEWARE DO NOT use your credit card here  I have had my personal & business accounts hacked now FOUR TIMES from this business  After the initial incident last year (on 2 separate cards) I was assured security precautions were implemented & systems were updated  My bank recently contacted me a week prior to receiving a letter from Restaurant Depot informing me that my credit information was AGAIN compromised and fraudulent use of my credit had been taking place for a MONTH prior to them notifying me HORRRRRIBLE  I can not respect any legitimate business who composes a letter and fails to respectfully notify 'valued' customers of KNOWN illicit activity for more than 30 days  Lesson learned this business can not be trusted.
1940,1,I came here for the first time with a friend We were really pleased by the great service from our server and the rest of the staff The owner was very welcoming and friendly which made for a great experience The food was just as good as the great service I'm already looking forward to my next visit.

610,1,If you're itching for cheap down-n-dirty quick eats that taste nothing like authentic Mexican fare this is your stopTaco Bell is the bomb - even back in the 80s I mean who can resist those crunchy tacos So delish It is especially good after a wild night out I can honestly say that if you eat Taco Bell when you're intoxicated and you go to bed you'll feel pretty damn good in the AM It makes me laugh when I find shredded cheese and tomato bits on my coffee table in the morning from my 2:30am feeding frenzy Silly wabbit.
4582,0,"HORRIFIC EXPERIENCE  I decided to save a few dollars and go to this Great Clips location for a quick shampoo and trim  As I walked in there was an elderly man in front of me  He was asking how long the wait was and if it was possible to put his name down The Assistant Manager Immanuel was extremely rude to him and told him they don't take appointments and to go on-line to reserve a time Then the manager rudely asked him ""do you want an appointment or not"" and the poor man looked frustrated and said no and walked out  I was next in line and gave him my phone "
615,1,Fantastic Pizza Their cheese is great toppings are good and they have some interesting and tasty combinations (gourmet slices) All fairly priced and the staff are incredibly friendly The calzones are also tasty (and quite large) with a very nice garlicy dough/crust They have some incredible-looking deserts which I have yet to try Overall if you are a fan of mom 'n pop style new york pizza you will enjoy this place.
4105,0,My overall review for this location of Brueggers is 1-star But I must say when you ACTUALLY get what you ordered the food is quite good I prefer Brueggers over Einstein's any day The bagels are softer and I enjoy their flavors better But one can only describe a trip to the Brueggers at 24th and Camelback as either a trip to the Twilight Zone an episode of Candid Camera or a stint on Punk'd (or a combination of all of the above) The employees are friendly enough and it seems to be locally owned and operated but the employees are slow inept and downright stuipd I hate to call anyone stupid but there really is no other explanation You must repeat even the simplest of orders at least three-four times and only order one item or sandwich at a time No matter what type of bagel you ask for they grab a different one and you have to nicely inform them once again of the kind you wanted If you ask for no cheese on the sandwich they put it on any way Ask for bacon You get sausage It's really that badOne trip I ordered two sandwiches Knowing their level of service I ordered SLOWLY and asked for one sandwich at a time The employee asked me three times what type of bagel four times if I wanted it toasted and still got it wrong I seriously felt I was on MTV's Boiling PointsMy last three visits I brought the food home only to find the order was wrongToday I ordered two bagel sandwiches One was correct the other was totally wrong after reminding the employee three times of what I wanted (and after stopping him from grabbing the wrong bagel)I live nearby its a convenient location and the food is good The service SUCKSI typically go on the weekends but I have friends that work in the building and they have had similar experiences during the week and have stopped goingYou have to experience this for yourself Words seriously can't describe.
2443,1,If I have a friend visit me from Seattle(where I grew up) THIS is where I take them Anytime I meet someone new to AZ with the same taste as me in almost anything I bring them here If it were not for this place and only a small handful of others I would be embarrassed when entertaining anyone from a real city that has any culture or class Lost Leaf = 5 HUGE STARS.

3630,0,Eeewww Skip this place The food is gross- no seasoning on anything I got a pasta dish - so bland and pointless to eat My boyfriend got a burger that was way overcooked and the bun was too large to even eat with the meat Garlic bread was way spicy (why I don't know Wouldn't expect that to have a kick but my mouth was on fire) I got house wine to drink which seemed like it had been uncorked for a month so the next glass I upgraded which was a bad idea because I could only take a sip of because it was so gross Never again.
4325,0,"If you like food that reminds you of your 4th grade meal from elementary school then this is the place I hate to give it one star I really do because it seems like a small family business and our waitress was such a sweetheart BUT the food was awful If you like Greek salads be prepared to mix your own dressing with it It does not come mixed with the dressing If you like kalmata olives that you would get on a Greek salad ANYWHERE else be prepared because the olives on this salad are not kalmata The only thing that makes this salad ""Greek"" is the feta Other than that there is nothing special about it Their little bread on the side took me back to 4th grade elementary school where we got little buns on the side of our plates for lunch The spaghetti had a little bit of marinara sauce Wasn't even enough And which for being ""homemade"" had a very 'out-of-the-can' taste There was absolutely nothing special about this place Overpriced I guess if you are there on a hot summer day and your kids are playing in the water and get hungry than they would probably like the pizzas by the slice I saw them offer but for a dinner I highly recommend you go to Gramaldis down the street But the people are SUPER nice I would give this place another try if I saw major improvement and who knows maybe I will since I believe it recently opened up :)."
2512,1,Amazing food and usually it's amazingly crowded to go along with it Might be better since they opened their new location on Shea Blvd  The food is really good and cheap too- it's great to go with a group of friends Share cheesy bread pizza and pizzuki (i can't spell it but its a warm chocolate chip cookie thing with ice cream).
2074,0,i just finished a two year lease at the Heritage honestly the only reason we stayed so long is that we were on the 3rd floor moving was a b---ch the kitchen photo is the same as our units exactly the dishwasher sucks big time the pigeons overtake your balcony toothis place is not built very well they are constantly having blackouts and they do not compensate for lost food or anything (however one time they did put us up at a hotel) there is no bike rack and you cannot leave your bikes chained anywhere outside your apartment the security gates are always stuck open so anyone can come in several of the residents are continual beggars and bummers of cigarettes and coins who loiter around the mail boxeshowever i loved the pool area as hardly anyone ever used it while i was there i did have some great pool parties but there isn't a restroom by the pool so it was a constant hike upstairs for the loo the windows are so thin that you hear each passing wind bird and rattle from your neighbors doors closing shut i would not recommend this place unless you can deal with the blackouts beggars and continual shake of the window if your an east coaster this might be the place for you because you can hear everything your neighbor is doing in their place too.
3990,0,I can't even give this place a one star  The food was digusting  I ordered half of the rack of ribs  They were smeared in bbq sauce which is my fault as I failed to advise that I like my sauce on the side  The rib meat was gross and tasted OLD  I can't believe what I experienced yesterday afternoon  My sides were also terrible  I don't like my beans to taste sweet with bbq sauce  I was expecting more of cowboy bean taste  The potato salad was not my cup of tea and over peppered  I didn't care about the sides as much as those darn ribstasting so old  It appeared all they did was cook the ribs and then throw sauce on themgross and filthy tasting   I have eaten at Honey Bears on Van Buren over the years and loved it each time Sorry but the food at this Tempe Honey Bears location was out right terrible  This location is very nice and new but obviously they don't know how to cook and used expired meatgross  I was so looking forward to great bbq that I always experienced at the restaurant on Van Buren  I will never return.
4570,0,I didn't even want to give one star I don't know what happened to Nypd I placed my order and they had to call me back to tell me they don't make a certain item anymore I read it right off there website they need to update their menu Nypd use to be my favorite place to get pizza not anymore To make matters worse they charged me extra for getting a similar dish and didn't tell me intern the delivery boy didn't get a big enough tip since I was paying with all the cash I had on me I felt so bad Nypd need to clean up their act.
3565,0,If it were only a review for the girl at the front who got got my order perfect we would give it a 5 star rating However the rating was diminished by 4 stars because of the incompetent man in the back He got simple order incorrect 3 times Upon finally getting it right he forgot to put Carmel on the top as requested an payed for After this he gave my sister iced tea without shaking it sweetening it or putting it over ice Really.
1384,1,Delicious Bruschettas Great Wine & Beers and amazing customer service Everyone here is very nice and helpful I love the building and the area out back of the restaurant Although I mostly come here to have drinks after work I have eaten here a few times The Bruschettas are all good and you get to pick 4 different ones I have also been here for brunch Great coffee and the I got the Yogurt fruit and granola It was very good and it's perfect if you're looking for a light breakfast on the weekend Two thumbs up.
801,1,I had never heard of Sweet Republic until a week ago  I knew they were celebrating their birthday by giving away free single scoops of ice cream  I read several reviews and not one of them had anything bad to say about it  I am now one of those reviews  This place is awesome  I had the brownie swirl  Love it  Check this place out  They also have sorbet.
4802,0,"So I returned Wow this winter menu sucks I will not go backTechnical difficulties When I was finished all systems were down and I had to wait to pay It would have been nice if my waiter had told me this during the half hour I sat there agitated and kept asking for the check Before finally manually taking my credit card infoBUT MY HUGEST GRIPE:I had the Farro Risotto (Foraged Winter Mushrooms Stracchino Cheese Green Garlic $16 + Wild Shrimp add on for $5 more) It tasted like how can I accurately describe thisYou know how after you're sick to your stomach and you vomit you get *that* breath You can taste it smell it and it makes you cringe It's vomit breathWell my risotto TASTED like what vomit breath SMELLS like It was pretty much VOMIT BREATH OATMEAL with four delicious tiny shrimp whose taste was miraculously unmarred by the vomit concoction that was my anniversary dinnerHonestly I ate bread to fill myself up I didn't want to send back my food (though I did complain about it but my waiter didn't really even notice anyways) I took over half of my meal home to feed to my roommates as a cruel prank since they were jealous they couldn't go with us to eat at Caffe Boa imagine it ""Yeah it was awesome I brought some leftovers home you want some""One of them actually vomited The other dry heaved for half an hour and lost his appetite And all of my leftovers (minus those two bites) are stinking up my fridgeYeah the roommate torture part was hilarious (they now hate me ha ha ha ha) but Caffe Boa lost a loyal customerActually 4 after you count my roommates boyfriend and myselfAnd there's still enough Risotto left in the fridge to taint at least a dozen more people against the placeThis was Caffe Boa's last chance after my last visit there and it was an epic fail Someday a year or two from now I MAY consider going back but I really doubt itI'll miss it a bit some of the food was amazing But I don't give a place third and fourth chances no matter how good it is on occasion."
3987,0,Stayed here with a friend for a few nights just passing through I managed to forget my laptop charger in the room It is an Apple laptop charger which run about $80 per I immediately called as soon as I realized and was on the road an hour away So i asked that I could please be charged to mail it to California The first girl I spoke to laughed at me on the phone but did say she found it I had 3 different people tell me they had it in their hands I gave all my info and everything and now they said it was never found Call me paranoid but it sounds like somebody got themselves a brand new charger.
2696,1,Epic win My husband and I stumbled into this restaurant wanting to try out something new We were blown away by the large selection the great service and delicious food This place quickly became a favorite and we will definitely be visiting more often After all there are so many more menu items to try.
3161,0,Don't understand why this Walmart higher prices I buy the same stuff at the other Walmart and this is a neighborhood Walmart and the prices are like two times higher what's up with that.
4176,0,First of all I saw this resturaurant on diners drive ins and dives I thought I'd give it a try I ordered the hard shell carne Asada tacos they were awful They tasted like rubber just very bland I think the meat might have been over cooked Needless to say I will not be returning.
1692,1,I love this restaurant I love the atmosphere and I love the food but I have been extremely displeased with this place in one area I love places with primo cards and member cards where you can accumulate points for free money Which Half Moon does which is great BUT the past 2 times I have gone to RECIEVE my ten dollars off my meal my card was restarted and the server said it was used on my last visit I also order the same meal for my boyfriend and myself and I also pay the same price I go there often to receive points so I can enjoy 10 dollars off every so often and the past 2 times I have not received Very displeasing I feel like the servers are going after I pay and adding the ten dollars off and keeping my tip I would hope not-After several confusing incidents with my promotional card the team of half moon really took the time to work things out with me I appreciate it when Customers have an issue and management takes time to address it so I'm changing my 3 stars to a five star.
1973,1,Exactly one year later and I've been to V's all but twice in the past 12 months and only because of scheduling conflictsIf coming from the Supercuts Greatclips etc ad nauseum experience V's will seem different Gone is the spikey uneven hair on top of the head Gone are squared off backs with remaining whiskers below the hairline A licensed barber will provide the shape neck taper straight razor and hot towel experience befitting of the well groomed gent or young manIt pays to look well and this V's location and Darwin in particular get my vote for excellent work.

1732,1,How can you not love Charming Charlies in generalI love that this Tempe Marketplace location exists (now I dont have to drive to fashion Square or CenPho)My only complaint about this location is that if youre here in the afternoon and trying to look at things on the east side of the store the sun will blind youThe staff here is very helpful and thats great cuz lets face it CC can be very overwhelming This is the 1st CC ive been to where I havent encountered an attitude from one of the employees Kudos Keep up the good friendly work.
1388,1,"Nice waiters Great food You really due pay for the atmosphere and the ambiance in my viewits worth it  I dont see to many places with the feel this place has I just was on my way from Portland and was lead to this place unknowinglyand it was just what I neededWaiters are niceOne of the bartenders kind of an ""one uper"" but over all nice people to talk to Soon to be a duke."
2185,1,The Cilantro Jalapeño hummus = heaven in my mouth No seriously- the hummus and the grilled chicken on top is so tasty and surprisingly healthy I was definitely a lil brought back that Pita Jungle came to the food court of the mall but I can say it hasn't lessened the taste or value of the food at all just made it that more convenient to pick up some of their amazing food Anything I've had off the menu ranging from their salads (both leaf and fruit) the hummus and the pita plates it's all great food.
1054,1,I had given up on ever finding great Chinese food in Arizona Chous is not only the greatest in the state but I would venture to say the best I've ever had anywhere  Seriously  Their beef pies are the best every time we go (which is pretty often now) we get beef pies and some kind of eggplant dish-- either the eggplant potato and jalapeno or eggplant in brown sauce Other favorites on the menu are beef friend rice any of the pies or dumplings and beef noodles You can't go wrong with ANYTHING you order even the fish is greatThis place has become our new favorite not just favorite Chinese but one of our all time favorite restaurants.
1909,0,This is about the saddest little kiosk I've ever seen Stranded in PHX three hours on the way to Cabo and four hours back I had enough time to browse four gates of culinary options Although there was one CPK ASAP that actually served pizza there were a few that were downright pathetic so small they only housed a fridge stocked with drinks and salad Isn't serving pizza the whole point Apparently not alwaysMy girlfriend and I did have pizza at the CPKASAP that served pizza There was a bit of a wait the seating area was pretty dinky and the pizza aside from the BBQ chicken toppings tasted to me just a half step up from Pizza Hut which also infests this airport Sure beggars can't be choosers and with limited options CPK may be as good a bet as any But it may do yourself some good to keep your expectations very very low.
2864,1,Unapologetically kitschy and undeniably wonderful  The staff is very friendly and cool  Their deals are great  The menu is delicious-- especially the appetizers (hello crispy coconut shrimp rolls and sweet potato fries with aioli) The Lilikoi margarita is my go-to drink It's just an all around fun place to go especially when it's not too hot and you can enjoy the patio.
3680,0,Ok first time I was here was for lunch I had the cheeseburger and it was one of the best hamburgers I had ever had Noticed the pool darts pinball golden tee and ancient bowling game and thought I would take my friends back there and share this incredible place two days later for dinner and drinks 3 of us went in and saw only one person working on a Friday night She was cooking bartending handling money scratching her head shaking hands cleaning bar tops running dishes etc did I mention she did not wash her hands once during this whole time We ate our dinners disgustedly thinking how an inspector would shut the place down immediately if they saw it She was entertaining all over the place yelling throwing things etc I'm pretty nieve and didn't know until my buddy told me that she was on meth at that time So there we have it a restaurant I thought would be a new favorite with a methead bartender that doesn't observe any food safety laws or regulationsI'll be getting my hepititis c test next week (joking kinda).
2544,0,In the world of cakes there's somehow an unspoken rule that if it's pretty it's okay to be subpar in taste and moistness In my world this does not compute It needs to be as tasty as it is pretty PeriodSo I can only give kudos to the artfulness of a Tammie Coe Cake but nothing more Cakes where you are told to remove the fondant and then eat it that's not right--you should be able to eat it all--and yummily so If you like the taste of fondant you've got to be kidding me--YuckySo take my review or leave it I just think a cake needs to be tasty and moist first and pretty second less of course it's for a wedding than it needs to be both EQUALLY Who has ever said no to an ugly but great tasting cake Not me So I'm putting my foot down and saying I won't eat a cake or cupcake that isn't tasty to meNow I must state that I am more a fan of cake than frosting Frosting is secondary to me So if you are more for frosting than for cake ignore my note and have at all the Tammie Coe's and Sprinkles of the world--and have mine no really go aheadIf there IS frosting--for me and others like me a little bit of frosting goes a long way with one exception: If it's Whipped Cream Frosting then BRING IT ON I like frosting's more subtler relative so if it's a Whipped Cream Iced cake I won't make it a point to get an inside piece or scrape off the icing at all as I would a basic frosted cakeAnyway Tammie Coe's cakes or cupcakes don't do it for me If I have to partake in one of her treats I'd shoot for her pastries or cookies before cake or cupcakeAs for MJ Bread I have no complaints there their breads really impressed I can't remember which CenPho restaurant I had my first taste of MJ bread but I remember being V E R Y impressed.
2003,1,Great pizza nice crispy thin crust great sauce best I have had since moving to the valley  Service was also good will be back for more I highly recommend giving them a try.
3715,0,Absolutely TERRIBLE Hands down the worst massage I have every had They have no clue what they are doing I left after 20 minutes it was that bad Even just that 20 minutes did more harm than good I feel ten times worse now then before I went in there yesterday If you would rather be further injured than this is the place otherwise STAY AWAY I I could give them less than one star I would.
4889,0,"Does it shock you that this place blows Does it really Ok let me back up as I'm assuming that every reader is as horrified with pop culture and the way our world cultivates youth I for one am simply primed for vomiting when viewing the primordial meat markets the likes of Scottsdale clubs foster But this place really takes the cakeI'm eccentric and irreverent when it comes to decor so the overall appearance of the place (gawdy mostly) doesn't bother me at all It's really just the simple and complete brainlessness of the whole operation The food is mediocre and the margaritas are standard The waitstaff is commonly too busy posing and catching their reflections in the one of many shiny distracting objects to provide any standard of service And the management my are they pretty Pretty uselessBut I'll rip the term ""doucheburger"" right from Jake C (that's awesome by the way): this place is filled with 'em Whom I'll bet pair nicely with the allll the cougars (those two terms rhyme a little try them together I bet you'll like it)."
587,1,The best burger in Phoenix  Reminds me of how Five Guys Burgers and Fries used to be  The smashburger and smashchicken (fried) are delicious  Ever since ordering the haystack straws I've never been able to muster up the motivation try the fries  You'll have to wait for your burger or chicken because they make it to order  That's a good thing by the way  And in case the name of the restaurant did not tip you off yes I will confirm it in all sincerity smashburger is not the place to go if you are on a diet.
3409,0,Horrible horrible horrible 4 or 5 times they have forgotten parts of order while using drive thru  This has not only happened to me but to my son and granddaughter   Was promised $5 coupon this last visit when arrived at store to pick up remainder of order told we don't have coupons we put you name in a book  How professional is that  I ask for a corporate number and no one could provide one  This just can't be true that a store don't have a list of phone numbers  Out of hot sauce too  What kind of operation is this  Very disappointed  They have lost my whole family's business.
1338,1,I've recently started hiking Piestewa Peak (I feeling like I'm cheating on Camelback) and I think I'm in love  This is a great hike that gives the stairmaster a new name  The views are amazing and its not too crowded  Parking can be hard to find but it's worth the hunt for a spot to hike this awesome trail.
4696,0,"I eat at a different Village Inn often I've even ordered catering for work events   I was in the area and decided to stop by this store  Unfortunately they fell very short on providing acceptable service   I should have known there may be a problem when I walked in  There were 12 people waiting in line to pay and leave  There was one woman complaining about something to the assistant manager  I'm not sure about what but I heard the assistant manager sarcastically and loudly say in front of everyone in the lobby ""Oh  I assure you ma'am I did""  She was obviously pissed off and she stormed out   As for me I waited 15 minutes at the table without a beverage  In the meantime two other tables after me were seated and had theirs  I went to the front to complain but there were no employees at the register or podium  Someone finally came up  I asked to speak with the manager  She said he was in the kitchen but would get him for me  It was the assistant manager I saw before  I told him about the slow service  All he did was tuck in his shirt while saying to me ""I am so sorry""  He made no offer to rectify the problem so I walked out."

4865,0,"DON'T EXPECT HOUSTON'SWe heard Houston's became Hillstone so as very loyal customers to Houston's (going 2+ times per month) for years we were excited to try Hillstone on Camelback What a disappointment The service was just awful very cold and impersonal one person in our group said ""hoity toity"" and the food was more expensive and not as quality compared to Houston's menu Everything about Hillstone is the opposite of Houston's Where the seating and atmosphere at Houston's was warm and inviting at Hillstone it is cold and impersonal Yes obviously much money was spent on Hillstone but in our opinion to its disadvantage because of its slight ostentatious presentation It is pretty but something about it felt offWe tried Hillstone two times in case the first time was a fluke but our experience was the same as the first Bummer for them because at our favorite restaurants we always tip 30-45% of our billIn their defense two things:1) Our experience was from the first year it opened which I noticed there are so many similar reviews to mine from that time so maybe they made some adjustments and2) Maybe they are not trying to be like Houston's which is fine for them but not for us We miss Houston's and wanted a version of it Hillstone is not it So we will keep searching."
2334,1,A must for the sports fan  Who cares about food when there is sooooo much to see The food happens to be good so it's an added bonus  Service is fabulous - but make a reservation  Open seats in the bar are few & far betweenThank you thank you Justin Green for your awesomeness.
2228,1,Brackin's is exactly what Scottsdale so sorely needs  A nice friendly neighborhood joint to grab a drink for less than $1000 (way less) that is unpretentious warm and inviting  You don't even need fake boobies or cougar attire to get in although I doubt you would be turned away  I came with my husband for the first time for a Yelp event organized by Donald S  Our own Michael C was not behind the bar that night but enjoyed the evening with all us Yelpers and made sure Brackin's knew to expect us  This place is small  But with the two patios we were set  The owner Doug treated us like family  Our server Renee ran her little butt off and we were never without a drink in hand  And the best part clean bathroom.

2083,1,Oh Hao Bao you so tasty I was finally able to try Hao Bao at downtown's Food Truck Friday and boy am I glad I did I ordered the Street Treats (chicken) and the original dumplings (pork and shrimp) The wait seemed forever since there were so many people vying to get some delicious food The truck was having some trouble keeping up with the orders but everyone was real friendly and the food tasted so good Definitely worth the wait I took mine to go and slowly savored it as I drove off Pretty soon my delicious lunch was gone and I was wishing I had some more Truth be told it was really filling and I could have shared Not that I wanted to but for future reference or if you are a light eater you might want to shareI'd definitely go again and can't wait.
3393,0,"Extremely disappointing service and inconsistent quality compared to other locations  I ordered several meals online including one gluten free and arrived at the time it was supposed to be ready I was told three of my meals were ready but that they wait for the person picking up a GF order to arrive before preparing it Then I was told that  they are working on it ""now"" Even though their excuse made no sense I believed it wouldn't be long since it wasn't a complicated order and tried to be understanding I waited Then was told ""Sorry for the wait  Have a free drink while you wait"" I didn't want the drink Then I was told again that they were working on it ""now"" and offered a free drink A supervisor type complimented the crew saying ""good job for getting through all those orders with only a GF order"" left to do as if keeping a GF order waiting is preferred And the food quality was inconsistent with other locations."
2970,1,DAMN this place has everything sushi pork chicken beef soups shrimp fruit Ice cream even pizza OK this is the kind of place that is dangerous for a big man trying to downsize I almost went and found the manager to have him bar me from this place It's just too tempting It's like one of the really good seafood buffets in Vegas I saw no down side to this place Me and a friend had lunch and it came to $2400 for two I could have easily ate that in shrimp and ribs alone Man I'm getting hungry just typing this If you like a good clean and plentiful buffet this is the place Damn they are good.
1936,1,The best Breakfast I have had in at least 10 years When we walked in the whole place had this wonderful mesquite campfire smell The carne asada I ordered was amazing It had the perfect amount of charred smoky red chille flavoring and made this one memorable meal.
2397,1,Probably my favorite breakfast spot Depending on my mood this is how it's done eggs are either over easy or poached:Shrimp enchiladas -- red and green chileHuevos Rancheros  -- red and green chileCarne Adovada  -- red only Lately it's been a lot of enchilada though I feel the huevos rancheros starting a resurgenceBreakfast entrees are about $10 02 and worth every penny.
4499,0,I have been to Chompie's many times and have never been thrilled However after our last visit I will NEVER return I have never been treated so poorly in a restaurant as I was at this location last Sunday morning We were quoted a 20 minute wait Even with a 1 year old child we thought we would give it a shot After waiting for 45 minutes I went up to see what the delay was as they had seated many people who came in after us before us They were working for of 3 seperate handwritten lists and had NO comprehensive system (And this was one of the MANAGERS) When I asked when we would be seated she practically yelled at me and told me she had no idea Seriously Needless to say we left NEVER AGAIN.

2540,1,I had dinner here with my wife last night for my birthday  I can best describe our dinning experience by using the best urban adjective I can think ofour experience at Kai was RE-DONK-U-LOUS  The whole dining experience was like watching a ballet Every move our waiter (Daniel) and his assistant made was well choreographed purposeful and symbolic Each menu cover has a watercolor painting that is designed by local Pima elder Mike Medicine Horse Zillioux (he is also the flute player you will hear in the back ground while you eat) In addition each menu cover design comes with a story given by our waiter The wine list was extensive and the sommelier was very knowledgeable on the list but the sommelier self-admitted  that  the list needed some updating since some of the wines listed were not in stock However no ding here from us As the sun was sitting Daniel (our waiter) pulled back one layer of the curtains in our room which gave an effect of the wonderful colors of a setting sun in the entire dining room After the sun was half way down the Estrella Mountains did Daniel pull back the final layer of the curtains and we were in such aweFOOD:THE BEGINNING (Appetizer)We started with the Lobster Degustation This dish was made up of three lobster dishes The first was a buttered braised lobster tail under an avocado mousse tear drop salsa & lobster coral Second lobster dish was lobster knuckles in sweet corn panna cotta with sour radishes Third was a lobster cobbler with mesquite meal & burnt Irish porter cheese (this one was my personal best)THE JOURNEY (Entree):Wife had the Red Deer Venison Loin with Sage Infused Gnocchi The venison was prepared with a spiced sweet chile & fair trade coffee rub served under a broccoli rabe puree shaved pecorino & currant jam Wife describes it has tender and flavorful without any of the game taste that sometimes come with venisonI had the the Grilled Tenderloin of Buffalo from the Cheyenne River Tribe This dish was prepared under smoked corn puree cholla buds Merquez Sausage (chorizo) and scarlet runner bean chili and Saguaro blossom syrup Again no game taste and very tender The buffalo was cooked so well that it was like cutting into some butter WOW THE AFTERLIFE (Dessert):We had the Creme Brulee Meets Old World which consisted three creme brulee dishes The first dish was an Eclair inspired creme brulee which was a mesquite meal choux & lavender custard Second was ice cream sandwich inspired It was made from two pieces of ginger snap in between a Mexican vanilla bean ice cream creme brulee The final dish was a meringue pie creme brulee that was a masa pastry tart & meyer lemon meringue Great dessert It was such a wonderful experience Every detail of our dining experience was thought out carefully From our forks and spoons being warm to the touch when our main courses came out and to them being chilled when we received our desserts.

1779,1,Blue Nile was good this is better It's really good guys I was really happy after the meal in the way that only food can do if something unhappy deep inside of you has been satiated The food is super inexpensive too There's an Ethiopian menu and a Mediterranean oneThe berbere mix they use here is pretty mild but I think it's better that way I usually prefer in-your-face-spice the kind that you know will make your taste buds gush and pop If not that I at least like spicy because it's interesting and makes the other flavors taste better This berbere was neither but the subtle notes of the spices worked so well together it produced the same effect This Ethiopian guy I met once told me you can evaluate how good an Ethiopian place's food is by the berbere--it's present in so many dishes The injera was OK the most important part to me was that it wasn't soggy like it's been sitting out too long I think injera is usually more sour and the flavor didn't hold up to the food's but since the food was so good it was fine I didn't get to try the Doro Wat (they were out) but I'm going back today to try itThe Mediterranean dishes weren't super Mediterranean-y seemed like they had an African influence on them Or maybe they were Either way pretty decentTechnique doesn't matter as much as flavor for this type of food but I didn't notice anything majorly wrongAnd the owner is really nice That doesn't make the food taste better but it makes a better restaurantI've had two great meals in the last two weeks--one in a top Zagat rated restaurant in Boston (for ~$100) and here (for like $10) My only fear is that since this place is new it's in a honeymoon phase and the effort level will drop off soon.
4828,0,I hate this airport friendliest my ASS From security to gate agents to bus drivers to parking cashiers this is one of the LEAST friendly airports I have ever subjected myself to I've lived in many cities and currently have to endure the complete crap this airport is in every imaginable way I'm so frustrated with it I will consider driving to LAX just to avoid using this shit hole Yup sitting here now after getting effed by United on a code share with Lufthansa Umm Lufthansa why do you code share with this abomination of an airline Maybe driving to Tucson is an option because I am not coming back to this place PHX BOO.
4722,0,Food was poorly made Pouched eggs thrown on a thin layer of stale sour dough bread with a touch of goat cheese that was very hard to find under wet asparagus and over cooked cheery tomatoes.
3664,0,Don't go here for your banking Their customer service is terrible and they are incompetent I wanted to get away from the big banks because I'd heard that the smaller banks like credit unions were better So far they are no better In fact the customer service at Bank of America was WAY better at least I could get a live person whenever I needed it Reaching a live person at the credit union is next to impossible in my experience My impression is that they prefer that you either take care of what you need through their automated system or use email which sometimes just doesn't cut it Their response time is like molasses Another thing to beware of is fees You must read the fine print I didn't know that I would be charged a $10 per month fee if I didn't sign up for their E-statement program Basically they are charging you $10 per month for a paper statement Last I knew stamps cost 50 cents and a sheet of paper maybe 5 cents I don't know what kind of labor goes into printing and automatically sending a statement once per month but I do know it doesn't cost $10 since everything is automated these days  Also beware of their Popmoney fee I tried using the service without success and was forced to cancel the transaction Lo and behold the next day I was slapped with a $32 fee (it looks like they were treating it as a stop payment on a check) Nowhere was there anything posted about this exorbitant fee And again I ask why does a fee need to be leveraged when everything is run by computer It just seems greedy to meIn closing I would like to say that this credit union is making me regret my decision to leave BofA At least BofA as long as I fulfilled my contractual obligations for the account (ie kept a balance or used direct deposit) never charged me any feesMoral of the story: Research banks before you leave one and join another Hopefully my review will help you make the right decision.
1547,1,Excellent pizza but make sure you get a whole pizza  In other words if you want their best pizza don't order it by the slice I got into the habit of getting a slice or two after I work out at the gym and the slices were just ok That was because they heated up the slices from a pizza they made earlier  But one weekend I ordered a large freshly made pie and what a difference Some of the best tasting pizza I've ever had  I've been going to NYPD since they opened and the staff has recently changed (within the last year or so)  The original staff I all knew by name are long gone They'd throw in a free soda quite often but after checking with the newer employees a lot of the original ones were let go for giving out freebies  Too bad A little hospitality goes a long way in my opinion.
3523,0,I also purchased a voucher through livingsocial  I had left several messages and finally got a call back but missed it  The message left (@ 8pm) stated they were 'in the office now' and provided another number  I called right away and received the same mailbox that you get when you call the number on the voucher  I have now left several messages over the past few weeks on both numbers - still no return call  I have contacted livingsocial to advise them that this business may no longer be active.

4004,0,"Time warp banking Very low tech Like banking in the early '70s Ditched their checking account but kept the Visa Credi Card The free checking was nice because it would refund the fees that other banks charge for using their ATMs But the customer has to do all the work by saving the receipts and mailing to Birmingham AL Other banks offer this but the computer system keeps track and automatically rebates the fees at the end if the cycle If you complain about it the just say ""This is the way we do it""."

1528,1,The pizza is great and it's so original The price is good and the food is great But don't ask them for ranch it will highly offend them they say that people use ranch to cover up the taste of bad pizza The cheese is amazing.
2367,1,If you like sports bars/ restaurants you'll love this place During spring training lots of Giants fans hang out here and the food is great There is lots of different types of draft beer and the service is excellent My wife and I went there a couple of days ago and at this time of year there isn't a lot of activity in that area of town Even at this time of year the food is great.

155,0,Michelle was the worst server If you don't like your job and have a bad attitude find a new career  We ordered drinks (2 of us)  it took 15 mins  We ordered 2 appetizers and asked to keep the menu as it was our 1st time there and would like to order more One app was a crab crunch roll the other was an order of lettuce wraps Crab crunch had a hair in the side of ginger Lettuce wraps were alright We never saw our server we had to get our own chop sticks and soy sauce  We waited 25 minutes for the apps Our drinks were gone by the time the apps came WE NEVER SAW OUR SERVER  She knew we wanted to order more as we explained  When she finally came back we asked for the check and she was so rude We explained how we had a hair on our plate drinks were empty we wished to order more and we haven't seen you in 30 min  She was the worst server we have ever had Will not be back I will also tell everyone I know not to go there We even asked the bartender to get our server Which he did and she yelled at him We are shocked at the service Whoever hired this girl needs to rethink.
3387,0,"Walked in at 8 on a Friday night  The place was half empty open tables in full view and we were told the wait would be 15 - 20 minutes We must have appeared baffled as we looked around at the abundance of available seating and were told they were ""re-setting""  That must be industry lingo for ""we have no intention of waiting on you"" It smelled good & we were in the mood for Italian so we went into the bar (two couples at tables but otherwise empty)  We sat down and anticipated a friendly bartender but instead watched four different employees come behind the bar and without even a glance in our direction turn right around & walk back out I will never try this place again and will be sure to tell everyone I know I signed up for Yelp just to share this ridiculous experience."

3308,0,As a  a long time Flo's customer the new layout of this location is horrible The hostess stand has been moved to the side allowing waiting  customers to flow into the dining room and lean against your table while you're eating   Absolutely refuse the first table behind the hostess stand it is a miserable experience When I complained about it Flo said its because they were busy Well on my job when I earn the money that I spend at flos I can't provide poor customer service just because we are busy Bottom line with flos is they have gotten too big  making money is more important that the client experience Find another establishment until they put clients first.
4491,0,I don't see the need to ever go to this place unless you are flying in or out of the Deer Valley Airport and you just got off the longest flight in the history of flights and there was no food on board  The buffet is just kinda gross  They advertise a fish fry on Wednesdays and Fridays but I don't see how they feel confident standing by their advertised fish fry  It's just kinda gross  The fried cod was too breaded and the fish didn't seem fresh or prepared right  The lasagna was good but not worth revisiting this place for  I also sampled the shrimp cocktail (which was ok but may have given me the shits) fried shrimp (bleh) fried chicken (ok) their soups (weren't very good) chocolate cake (crappy and stale tasting) rice pudding (barely ok)  and the table bread was fresh and nice (so stock up on that shit)Oh and not a fan of their salad bar either really  Sorry Deer Valley Airport restaurant (although really I think you should be apologizing to me) but I'll never be coming back.
4673,0,Drinks are a bit over priced The food is above average bar food My problem is with the doorstaff it seems like everytime we are there the doorstaff is hustling me/one of my friends about dumb stuff [IDs expiration dates footwear etc]  They also seem to have a proclivity towards abuses of power I've seen the doorstaff get into altercations where they clearly had the upper hand/control of the situation and still continued to use violence [for fun] Most recently they had a guy on the ground on Ash in a headlock and still continued to kick him Sorry but I need a de-stressing waterhole.
2632,1,I just celebrated my birthday here this past weekend and I have nothing but awesome things to sayFirst off I know the private rooms are for bigger- more spendy types but Modern Steak accomodated 18+ of my friends (after I changed the number like 3 times) Everyone from the VIP party person to the hostesses that answered my calls were super awesome and welcoming When we got there immediately went to the chic bar and had a few drinksCan't go wrong with a little Dirty Goose but it was nice that they also had the Bleu Cheese Olives for my Kettle Dirty friends:)We all caught up at the bar and sat in one of the rooms and I felt like a Princess sitting at the head of the tableMaple Salmon -- Delish Mac and Cheese to die for and whoever thought about combining bread with bacon needs to get a RAISE And the topping to the evening was my awesome birthday Dessert Whoever is the Chocolate Writer there is absolutely wonderful and it added a little extra to my wonderful dessertThank you Modern Steakcan't wait to dine here again.
4115,0,Ate here due to great reviews So so so disappointed Shrimp taco was gross and was made with uncooked tiny salad shrimp with cabbage thrown on top Chips & corn tortilla uses for a shredded beef taco were stale Cheese enchilada and southwest burrito were okay.
9,1,This place is amazing I come here at least once a month & am never disappointed Food & service is always great The buffalo burger it TDF as well as the bruschetta Outside seating is so cute with a lights (great for date nights) live music inside is a wonderful touch This place is great to meet with friends family or date night It's truly a Scottsdale must.
2742,1,Is it cheap  Yes  Are the chips fresh and the salsas free  Yes and yes  Is the food delicious  YeeeeesssssWhenever I'm back in Arizona I hit up Rosa's for some authentic Baja deliciousness  Their Baja platter with fish and shrimp tacos is my go-to staple but their chimichongas and enchiladas are also great(Oh I also forgot  Are their beans addictive  Yes).

4758,0,Food was good but service was slow Did not get waters until we were seated for 15 mins Had to track down our server just to get orders in It was not busy so not sure what the issue was To top it off there were flies Fortunately my girls thought it was funny when I swatted one If yelp support typed pictures I would post it as evidence.
3548,0,"I hate giving places ratings this low but I have no choice We have just recently moved here from Miwaukee where there are fish frys every Friday We gave up meat for Lent and wanted to get some fish a quick simple meal that we could take home  That's where Pete's comes in The food is disgusting It's like they have some deal set up with Arpaio where they get expired frozen prison food so that they can charge the prices that they do ( should have also been my first clue)   EVERYTHING is processed and they use the cheapest quality ingredients  I saw ""crabettes"" and thought they might be some type of fritter It's fried imitation crab sticks Service was good It's just the food that is so bad I understand it is a family business and has been in Phoenix forever which is super admirable I would hope that maybe they would just try to re-invent their menu a bit Fresh seafood for a chain like this is a lot to ask in the desert I think maybe if they paid an extra 20 per unit they could get a naturally formed filet of fish I will definitely not ever go back here."

3017,1,Wow this is my 100th review  And what a great place to get it  There is a dog park area near the corner of College and Curry with restrooms and park benches  A really nice sized park with some mountain bike trails going through and some nice short hikes as well  Great views of the city if you will climb up a hill and some small ponds you can fish in  Theres so many great areas of this park and they all have different character and atmosphere you cant go wrong.
4246,0,really sad  really small  I am used to farmers markets in other cities  I try not to compare but cant help it when it takes a whole 5 minutes to navigate the whole market  an awful lot of non local products at way to high a price  I did run into a local resident I met when I moved to phoenix 1 1/2 months ago and turns out it was his first time here  also his last he said  I am also an animal lover and a crowded market is no place for dogs and non supervised children  the lawyers would have a great time with it  save your hard earned money and go to sprouts.
589,0,Well I never Lived Here But I got a really nice look at the place when I tracked my stolen iPhone To an apartment there  You have to love the find my iPhone app You could see it was in one specific section of the apartments The police was nice enough to come out and knock on the doors However most of the people who live there simply turn off the lights and didn't answer the door  It's that kind of friendly place So here's what you do if you want to live with people who will steal somebody's iPhone from a clothing store Changing room Definitely move there.
3992,0,Yes the owner is really nice and they do have a really old grocery store (which means most of the ethnic stuff they are selling are old)But commenting on the food I had the baba ganoush and the Kefta kebab The ganoush was bitter (methinks came out of can with citric acid and other preservatives imparting the bitter taste)The Kefta wasn't that bad (but I have had better) however the: tzatziki enveloping the kefta was bitter I have found the same phenomenon in Spices on the other side of 101 Either that is how it is made or else they both are using canned stuff to feed to us.
4334,0,Staff were completely uninterested Bread was kinda soggy (on the outside) like it was close to something steaming and one of the cucumbers were moldy/rotten Won't be going back EVER.
2471,1,First and foremost- thank you to my wonderful husband who gave me the world's most perfect ring I had looked for months for the perfect wedding band to match my antique reproduction engagement ring with an oval diamond (which was purchased from a nightmare of an on-line jeweler by my now husband) and was having trouble finding something that matched and that I loved In our jewelry store search we just happen to stop in at Gemsetter & Company in Chandler I had a vague idea of what I wanted and found it difficult to describe and Eric took the time to listen and even was able to do a quick drawing of a curved band that carried over some of the antique elements in my engagement ring  We were considering on purchasing a mold of the custom wedding band to have the option of a curved band on either side of my engagement ring in the future but Eric gave us a great deal (2 rings for the price of what other jewelers were quoting us for one)  He is an experienced and passionate jeweler and showed how much he cared about what he does by offering to the wax mold and cast the rings in white gold without a deposit because he was excited about the possibilities with such a unique ring set  The end result turned out better that I could have ever imagined  The rings are just beautiful and I would recommend Gemsetter & Company in Chandler to anyone.

1140,1,Everyone is so friendly in particular Myra in the Impulse department  She's always friendly and has a good eye for fashion  She has no problem telling me what looks good on me and what doesn't  She's never pressured me into buying anything and for that I keep going back - been over 2 years  I love this location  It's always so clean and the layout is easy on the eyes  I don't get overwhelmed when I walk in    I agree with others when the selections are as big as other locations but their level of customer service by far stand out  Having a Starbuck's at this location and a handful of coupons is always a good day.

4191,0,Sprinkles cupcakes is nothing special and it just goes to show marketing is everything The service is great and the presentation of the cupcakes is nice When you see the pretty cupcakes in their nice box you really think you are getting a gourmet cupcake like other bakeries The red velvet cupcake was Just ok The Carmel apple and cinnamon sugar cupcakes were muffins They were good but I was expecting a cupcake The chocolate vanilla with sprinkles was the best but nothing to write home about There are tons of great bakeries out there with amazing cupcakes I will never come back here and I hope one day more people see past all the gimics and realize sprinkles is just a fancy store selling over priced regular old cupcakes and muffins.
937,1,This isn't a 'just went to this place once' review - it's a 'been going to this place for years' review Just thought I'd clarify that before getting into it Rula Bula rocks It was actually my first culinary experience when I moved to the valley 7 years ago I was skeptical as Irish pubs don't typically have a great deal to offer vegetarians (which I was at the time now I eat fish which opens up the menu a bit) but Rula Bula's got a few really tasty veggie options including veggie potato skins vegetarian shepherd's pie (that's right - never seen that anywhere else and oh so delicious) and the four-cheese grilled sandwich I prefer to go for lunch or dinner as the place gets a little college kid crowded rowdy the later it gets Yeah I know - I'm old.
2249,1,The hangover sandwich here actually works I swear whenever I am having a rough Sat morning I crave that sandwich and if I get it ahhh I think I am cured :).
923,1,I live no where near this place & have gone out of my way to eat there MANY times I haven't been since it moved (bc I had no idea where they went) but it looks like it's bigger so that's great I even made it a point to take an out of town friend here I don't know about the new place but the old place was kind of a hole in the wall diner feel (in a good way) It can get really busy at lunch so I don't recommend it for a lunch break from work I did that once and got in and out just fine but it's a lot more fun without the time crunch Everything is delicious but the mini red velvet cupcake is always a must.

1402,1,very good deli - not quite like the best NY delis but for being in Tempe it's OK.
703,1,I recommend this place to anyone who enjoys authentic italian deli style sandwiches I ordered their specialty sandwich with prosciutto fresh mozz olive oil peppers and it was outstanding The only reason I wouldn't get it again would be to try something else on the menu The bread alone was good enough to be eaten by itself There was little to no wait to have our orders taken and plenty of seating available which is not easy to find when looking for a place to eat lunch at noon during the weekDon't be fooled by the surroundings this place is a must try for all.
259,1,I'm so happy to have my grandson and my son and daughter in law living here We all love the shaded property which is so hard to find in the desert valley of Phoenix The staff is very friendly and attentive to detail Thanks for being an oasis in the driest state we have ever lived in.
3139,0,"OKAYSoI've tried this place twiceFirst time was the Saturday before Easter Sunday I understand they were extremely busy because of Easter I didn't mind waiting an hour prior to being seated because I understood I was a walk-in I was also speaking with another customer who said she's been coming here for like 10 yrs or so I admit I was impressed and wanted to try their service I tried their Deluxe Spa Pedicure - includes anything in the spa pedicure plus sea salt treatment callus eliminator cooling gel hot towel and French tip or design $37 I enjoyed the treatment though the wait and it was super relaxingno conversation as the workers seemed overworked tired and ready to jet for the door mind you it was 720pm and one of the male workers brought in a $5 pizza from Little Ceasars a few doors down Anywhotoday was my 2nd visit I went it wanting that relaxing pampering treatment from before since I felt I deserved to treat and give myself a break from work kids and running errandsI signed in at 450pm I was told to pick out a color etc I was seated in less than 10 minutes I thought ""Awesome Faster than before""  I literally sat there cross referencing my calendar paid bills made appointments for my kids etcI realized my toes were like prunesAND 58 minutes had passed byoh no I am normally a patient person IF customer care is addressed But since no one checked on me offered me a magazine water etcI got impatient and quickly very UN-impressed from the first experience and despite what others have said I say this because there were three other women in there besides me This was a first for me to walk out on a business I literally took my pruned soaked toes out of the water and walked out So instead of a relaxing rejuvenating experienceI was upset and highly disappointed    I will not be returning and am still in the need of a relaxing experience and great nail salon I'll pay my $37 pedicure and 20% tip elsewhereCiao."
4896,0,The fact that Bashas is still even in business both astounds and frightens me.
2392,1,I had to wait a few days to write my review of the Phoenix Art Museum because I thought I would be able to process everything I saw during a recent visit  I was wrong  I think I need to go back again and again because there is so much to take in it was my first visit but it certainly won't be my last  They have so many amazing exhibits and the 4 stories hold so many diverse pieces i was literally in awe during my tour  Shout out to Mark P and a huge thank you for walking me through your second home  I don't even know where to begin but a few of my favorite areas were the sculpture garden (it's manicured perfectly) the fashion design collection (I learned about the real meaning of 'couture') and the contemporary art collection (specifically 'Mass' made of burnt wood wire and string as well as the mirrored sound proof LED lighted room (talk about getting lost in time)  There is so much more that I'll have to go back to see more of and the exhibits are constantly changingPhoenix Art Museum also offers a ton of events and activities including films workshops demonstrations and discussions  There is also a really great area for the kids and teens as well as an Arcadia Farms on the premises  Next year they will be celebrating their 50th anniversary so I'm sure there will be plenty more unique festivities around that as well don't wait to go though go now  I had no idea what I was missing out on until I went - you should too.
1710,1,A great Italian deli on par with the best Italian delis in the US I  tried 6 or 7 dishes I was thoroughly satisfied with how authentic and fresh the food was This is a standout Italian eatery amongst a lot of competition in Scottsdale.
2274,0,I have been getting my gas here for years  I can't remember the last time the kiosks on island accepted cash  You have to go inside to pay cash and back inside to get your change waiting in line each time  So much for convenience  I'll go out of my way from now on to get gas elsewhere.
346,1,We saw it on Diners Drive-Ins and Dives and decided to go with apprehension Guy did not steer us wrong The Goat Karahi was the perfect combination of flavor and heat with a blend of spices I just placed an order to go while thinking about it Best in town but if you dont trust my culinary palate then look no further beyond the walls littered with awards If you are hungryGo NOW.
4497,0,"Service and staff were great Very friendly and accommodating However The food was awful The atmosphere was ""OK"" for the prices I expected a Lil more elegant space From the outside it seems upscale on the inside it feels like a comfortable dive type bar Seems as though they're trying to create an upscale menu for ""Scottsdale"" but falls short in atmosphere location and food The fish was a small portion and a bit over cooked the burger had a burnt grill taste and no mayo in the building and the Fries were WAAAAY overdone When  we asked about it they said they were supposed to be that way double fried :/ Yuck and completely Inedible Few beers on tap and the four peaks beers come in a CAN and it was Gross Possibly there are other items on the menu that would be better But We are unwilling to give them another try at those prices My suggestion is don't waste your money there are better options in Scottsdale for price atmosphere and comfort ability."
2897,1,Dr Jazz was great Im used to chiros that put me through an assembly line not even really noticing the issue Dr Jazz is more thorough and takes the time to treat the problem and help prevent it from triggering in the future Thank you doc :).
4315,0,"I WILL NEVER PATRONIZE THIS PLACE AGAIN IF IT'S THE LAST EATERY ON EARTH FOR A MEALBagels were ok but the attitude and reception from the owner is a MINUS (-5) but that grading is not possible but definitely warranted for this Owner and her establishmentI live in the Estrella Mountains and only minutes from this place so the wife and I frequented the store for weeks hoping to patronize local eateries and establishments And one thing became very apparent each and every time we went therethe owner of the establishment completely ignored us At first my wife and I thought maybe she was busy and didn't notice us but being such a small place you get to know everyone relatively quickly ESPECIALLY if they frequent your business each and every weekend  So we decided to say hello to her on one of our weekly Saturday visit to and see if we read it incorrectly and give her the benefit of the doubt but sure enough she never acknowledged us at all  Not even a smile  But it gets worse she walked passed us to greet another customer sitting next to us that arrived after we were seated So I looked at my wife and said ""it couldn't be because we are a interracial couple huh""  Oh maybe we were invisible or covered in manure It just had to be something we ourselves could not see or notice ourselves  I really didn't get itSo we went a few more times because this just couldn't be the case in the 21st Century with a Black President  Heck No  Sure enough a few more Saturdays passed and not even a look in our direction  I truly wish I could express how I feel about such people but I want this message be read and the message get out that this is our discovery dealing with this store never to spend another dime with them again  RIP."

2418,0,not  very pleased 2nd time around won't return.
4202,0,Not that impressed  Maybe I should have read other reviews from Google (http://mapsgooglecom/maps/placehl=en&safe=strict&um=1&ie=UTF-8&q=suntown&fb=1&gl=us&hq=suntown&cid=9747720966802647969)  Regardless I took two white shirts and black capris in Both shirts came back with stains still on them I mention this because I took them to another cleaner and the stains were gone  Again not impressed  :(.
4471,0,I had a friend who worked here so I use to get my hair done with her After she left I have tried going back a few times but I always have a bad experience The last time I had a pink streak put in my hair and I was told it would cost $20 At the end she charged me $80 It was ridiculous and I'm never going back again.
1795,1,ATTENTION LADIES WITH LONG HAIRHave long hair but want style without cutting all the length off Paul is the stylist to see then He gave me the most AMAZING haircut it has layers but not choppy it has movement and it's still longFirst off he gives a relaxing scalp massage when he washes your hair and bonus the shampoo bowl is very comfortable no achy neck afterThe building he is in is super cute very clean and if you want your nails done a facial or a killer brow wax there are other studio owners that can hook you upPaul knows how to cut AND color not something all stylists can boastSo do yourself a favor and check him out it doesn't hurt that he has a totally sweet personality too.
4984,0,I would have gave it zero stars but that wasn't an option First things first I am middle eastern and this is NOT the way authentic middle eastern food tastes like Everything was tasteless we ordered many different entrees and everything sucked I would NOT recommend this place to anyone who's looking to get an authentic middle eastern mealDisappointed.
2173,1,When I got home one day after work I found out my fridge full of food was not working I immediately started looking around for an appliance repair company hoping I can still get a hold of someone before 6pm Thank GOD I found Del Tech They came over within an hour and quickly fixed my fridge The tech was nice and professional  He also taught me some maintenance tips that I can perform at home.
598,0,I waited in a long line and when finally at the checkout the clerk said my merchandise was mismarked and she was charging me what the computer said I asked in three different ways for her to honor what the tag said and she just repeated what higher price she expected me to pay I left my entire order at the checkout and will never go back I buy a lot of clothes for my kids at Gap and this was my first time going to a Gap Outlet store  This particular store lacked friendliness customer service and truth in advertising  In retrospect I also feel a bit disgusted that their clearance items are actually more expensive than the 50% off of full price items and felt the whole store was a low quality trinket-filled cluster  My overall opinion of Gap in general is tainted.
594,0,I typically visit this McDonald's and am a regular due to the Playland my daughter and the Arizona heat As of late they have been completely lacking in the Customer Service end My latest visit left me quite displeased I waited 15 mins for my order and when it finally was ready my frys were  missing After pointing out the issue I had to wait an additional 5 minutes I got over it big deal But then my daughter asks me for an icecream cone so I go to order As I approach the register another patron enters and is behind me When this happens the manager and employee completely overlook me standing there placing my order and service the patron after me At this point I am shocked and appauled I decide to express my frustration to the assistant manager who offer me a very lackluster apology Avoid this place if you can help it.
4445,0,This is a copy of the letter I sent to Barro's:Today was the second time I patronized Barro's Pizza in Laveen The first time was last week At that time after getting home I discovered the order was wrong Upon calling the store and speaking to the manager I was given a credit in the amount of the wrong item But only after I told the manager I was not driving back to the store to correct the employe's errorI gave Barro's a second chance and they failed This time I asked for boneless wings with sauce on the side and upon getting home I discovered I was given regular wings and no sauce on the sideI returned to the store this time furious that I gave Barro's two chances and both times my order was wrong I try very hard to patronize local business instead of national chains but in the case of Barro's you have given me no alternativeI will never again patronize Barro's Not here in Laveen not anywhere The store manager Kenny was apologetic and refunded me the cost of the wings and even provided me the correct order I'm sorry but that is not enough I am not looking for any special or extra compensation I simply am telling you that I will never again patronize any of your establishmentsI cannot stress enough how disappointed I am with the lack of service and utter incompetence with this Barro's location I confirmed my order three times with Arial and once with Kenny on the phone and it was still wrong How does something like that happen I can tell you how Kenny was dressed unprofessionally Sneakers and shorts with an un-tucked polo shirt Two of the young ladies working were wearing gang color bandana's on their heads And every employee I saw which was approximately ten had to be under the age of 23 Most of them were probably around 20How does a business expect to thrive when it hires kids who's only concern is to get out of work so they can go play with their friends Why does a business hire kids who have no work ethic and simply do not care about the customers and doing their job rightI understand that for a business such as this the unskilled labor pool you can pull from is mostly just high school and college kids but that is no excuse for the horrible job they do I am sending this as a message and not posting it on your page so as to not publicly embarrass you On the other hand you could just simply delete any post that is placed hereAdditionally there is no link I can find on your web site to leave feedback I wonder why that isRest assured that in addition to me never again patronizing Barro's I will do everything possible to ensure that none of my friends ever do either.
4001,0,NO STARS FOR THIS PLACE We wanted to eat here only because they had charging stations for our car But guess what 2 suv's were parked in the spots and the sign clearly states NO PARKING UNLESS ELECTRIC VEHICLE  thought maybe the manager would help us out but he basically said F U Not getting my business guess I have to at least give one star but can't make a review with no stars.
806,1,the only thing i can review is the bean and cheese burrito because that's all i get and it's all i ever needtheir refried beans are the creamiest most savory in all of phoenix (i would except for casa reynoso except this is owned by the same family)i can't even find words for much i enjoy their perfect tortillas but i can say that i can gobble a burrito up in about 45 seconds and i am the world's slowest eater true story.
2738,1,Tried many different methods to deal with my back pain and other pain issues Saw chiropractors massage therapists in the USA Austria Syria Germany Libya and even tried the ones at airports hoping it would help a little Several thousand dollars later I met Daniel He explained his method to me (medical massage) and I was a bit skeptical about the promised results Oh boy was I way off and was he correct Daniel helped me while all others did a lot of talking without delivering I haven't felt that well for over a decade I would recommend him any day and cannot wait for my next appointment with him He takes his sweet time to do it right and proper shows that he really cares which is hard to find anywhere in the world Sounds exaggerated It is not I do not give testimonials it really is not my thing at all but in this case I am delighted to do so.
3434,0,This place used to be way better a few years ago when it was a Dannys Family car wash When Full Circle took over things went downhill It feels like no one takes care of anything and feels a little run down It's worth driving a few miles down the street and go to danny's instead Probably best to avoid this place.
1680,1,I just ordered delivery  It came hot and tasted delicious  I will order delivery again.
2915,0,"Ate once will never go back  The food has no flavor it is fine to make an attempt at healthy food but you cannot substitute real butter/ghee with vinegar to kick flavor up  All the curries had a muddy consistency and vinegary after taste   How can you screw up rice  It tasted stale the grains were broken up like it was from a bag century old - this was not basmati  This was the worst of both worlds but the public relations about ""healthy"" will fool the ""naturally"" endowed botox/silicone crowd of scottsdale."
727,0,Heaven forbid that any act I'm into is seeking a show palace out in Phoenix's paved over backyard Mesa ArizonaShort of a Smiths one-show-only reunion I will never venture here just to park my happy ass 3 miles from the venue plant my ass in an ocean of unenthusiastic knuckleheads who insist on sitting on their ledge in lieu of standing and praying for a geyser of alcohol to emerge from Mesa's rancid underground so that I may indulge in a beverage past 9 o'clockNo proper show should EVEN START by 10pm much MUCH less end by that time  WTF  How in the world did this venue even get approved  This is like getting a chance to party on the tour bus with Van fucking Halen only they decided to reunite with Gary Cherone as their frontman and they all were experimenting with homosexuality that week and drank Mr Pibb instead of Maker's Mark  A freaking nightmare this place.
3185,0,Have always heard Sprinkles has great cupcakes so I stopped in today with my daughter We ordered Lemon and Cinnamon We each took a bite of our own and then a bite of each others and went straight to the trash can The worst cupcakes we have ever eaten Very old crusty and very thick cake I truly do not know how this company stays in business Betty Crocker boxed cupcakes are amazing compared to these.
1601,1,Absolutely our fave place to go for Mexican food Out of all the mexican restaurants we have eaten at their salsa is THE BEST (love the hot and the mild) We have eaten there 30+ times and have only had bad service a few times Cant go wrong here.
4397,0,Wow I've never been to such a slow fatburger I ordered a burger and fries - no one in line and 1 burger in process ahead of me and it took more than 30 minutes I don't think the cook was aware you can start another order while one was on the grill  The quality was standard Fatburger - it's a chain  Don't come unless you have lots of time.
3997,0,So I've eaten at this restaurant before However the other night we had a guest in from out of town and an event earlier in the evening So we booked a reservation at this restaurant WHICH THEY CONFIRMEDWhen we walked into the restruant the place wasn't very busy and the greeter informed us that our reservation wasn't going to be honored but we were welcome to order a drink at the bar  Because it was already after 9 at that point we had a difficult time finding a place that could accommodate us on such short notice Interestingly we didn't even have the latest reserved seating they were offering there was one or two even later I eat out and entertain a lot for business and personal  I rarely write totally negative reviews But Not honoring a reservation that a restaurant has not only taken but have CONFIRMED just because the staff is lazy and wants to go home is completely unacceptable and shows a general lack of customer service and care for the clientI do agree with an earlier reviewer If you want seafood go to mccormicks and schmicks or for a more local flare The Salt Cellar.
1272,1,We're renting a house for vacation in the Queen Creek area and decided to try the good here at Serranos The three of us were throughly impressed with the decor-- seeing as most Mexican restaurants have too vibrant and cheesy displays-- Serranos had calm-tones with a nice interior with the only thing vibrant being their plates The wait staff were ALL friendly whether or not they were serving us specifically Our waiter was extremely helpful with a good sense of humor and knew the menu wellThe margarita mix was to DIE FOR and definitely was the perfect pairing with our dinner The steak and chicken fajitas I had were not greasy whatsoever and even tasted healthy and delectable with perfect portioning.
2357,1,"Went to Phoenix with my baby over the weekend He asks ""Baby wat u wanna eat"" I thought about it and said ""fried chicken boo"" Baby goes to get the food When he comes back I'm looking at him like he's the LAST chicken wing on the table""WHERE DA FOOD AT"" He hands me my container which I almost drop cuz I ain't expectin that much food I open and much to my delight3 juicy (NOT greasy) pieces of chicken greens mac n cheese and some good-ass corn bread Baby wasn't lyin when he said this place was GOOD He's from the South so I knew to trust his judgment =)  Can't wait to go back to Phoenix so I can have some mo' of that good goodfood LoL -)."
3250,0,Why do I continue to come back here  Because its the only place open to get an ice cream float Consistently wrong orders even when asked to repeat the order back Daytime is a little better with about 50 percent success After 9 pm no shot What is the name of the district manager please Uh uh you mean the store manager  No We don't have one Left messages for the store manager twice No callback Filled out the 10 minute survey- no feedback Your products are not horrible but your service is the worst Step it up guys.
510,1,This little shop is pure magic We sauntered in post dinner and had a fabulous finish to our meal The chocolate lava cake made me whimper and mewl The cake itself was a little piece of perfection and  the chocolate erupting from it truly amazing It was served with vanilla ice cream surrounded by a fine bed of chocolate crumbs We paired this with two bold red wines that really brought us to the apex of dessert heavenWe met Julia and are excited about her efforts to give the Ghana(ese) people a hand up It's a great mission to be able to change lives through chocolate We'll be watching her website due to be relaunched to see the progress of Julia Baker Confections.
412,1,Amazing food and even better service We went here for my wife's birthday based on a deal we found on travelzoo The owner right away gave my wife a free drink worth $30 Throughout the rest of the night out waiter took extra special care of us My wife even went as far as letting him pick her dinner for her Every bit of the food we ordered was amazingly good and we could tell it was home cooked No chain food here I had one of the specials fresh fish from Hawaii and it never tasted so good The soups taste just like something my grandma would have made.
793,1,"Went to check out this new treat place and was completely impressedI was like ""Oh hell ya vegan gelato""Frank helped us out offering us samples and letting us know what he puts in the gelatos to make them I chose a bit of the Pistachio Soy Gelato and Chocolate Soy Amaretto There wasn't a bit left in the bowl after 5 minutes I am going to be gaining some pounds over the summer I can already tell."
504,1,Great first visit  I'll try again soon and we'll see if they can keep the 5 star rating  I have to say I'm loving this corner of Frank Lloyd and Via Linda - several great options (Anacala with Pars Tesoro etc)  I've avoided this place until now (2 yrs in the neighborhood) because it looks awful from the outside - like a sports bar or cheesy diner with those stark blue signs in the windows - whatever it looks like it does NOT look like the cosy place it is We sat outside on a 90+ evening it was 'just right' - without annoying dripping misters The live music from inside was actually great (not too loud not intrusive recognizable songs sung well - what I want from live music in a restaurant) Even though we sat outside the inside looked VERY inviting  we'll see how cold it is (main reason I sit outside is that inside restaurants are too cold in summer) The lobster queso appetizer was great (but too filling)  My partner had the salmon and she loved it I had a steak and it was more tender than I could have hoped for  can't quite explain that one but it was good  Both my partner and I were served a large chili stuffed with potato - it was truly outstandingWill definitely be back Only downside was that they allow smoking on the patio luckily this visit there was no wind so the smokers in the corner were not noticeable  but that will lose a star or two for sure if I end up next to a smoking table.
3098,0,I was visiting AZ from California yesterday and a colleague recommended this sushi place  It was terrible  The service was slow I even told our waiter we were in a hurry and we still waited 40 minutes for one of the rolls only to find out the chef dropped the roll and had to remake it  Would not recommend.
3182,0,Food products are ok but I think some of the staff is pretty unprofessional  They INSIST on making small talk during checkout  Guess what not everyone is interested in making small talk with Trader Joe's staff  But they just can't seem to function unless you respond to their blither  One of the cashier staff made an inappropriate comment to me today perhaps he was upset I wasn't interested in pretending all the Trader Joe staff are my buddies  Geez get a brain this is just a GROCERY storeI am making a complaint to their corporate offices.
3406,0,Terrible Should have taken nobody in there as a sign I would say this place ranks below Panda Express Food tasted FUNKY I will not be back.
3826,0,I have only been going to LA Fitness for about 6 months I live in Scottsdale and work in Phoenix so I go to the 20th St & Camelback Scottsdale and Oak and McCormick Ranch locations  The Scottsdale locations are GREAT They are clean the staff is really nice and I see people cleaning the equipment when they are done  What is it with the Camelback crowd  The place really smells bad It really needs a good cleaning There has been this big spot on the carpet in front of the womens locker room since I started  I was on the treadmill the other day really noticing how stinky it was and then the guy next to me finished up and just walked off I swear he was sweating like a pig left the equipment drenched UGH  Good God I couldn't believe it Can't the employees make these people clean after themselves The reviews are right about the staff just hanging around at the front deskthey should be cleaning something anything  It really is a shame that this centrally located facility is a real stinky mess  I can't wait for the new one to open on 7th Avenue Maybe then they may clean up their act.
4349,0,Well I used to come here all the time until I came with my kids  Since they don't have a kids menu I would of thought that the waitress would split a reg breakfast for my two little ones since she told me that she would figure something out for them She came out with three big size plates my kids are 37  What bothered me is the check was $4700 and that ruined my day with them I couldn't afford to do anything else I will not be coming back instead I go to black bear diner now their prizes are great and the food I can say is better than the farmhouse.
1315,1,Recently discovered this gem Cool loft-like space good coffee and great people watching with an eclectic urban mix that makes me feel like I'm in a real city  This is the kind of place that makes you want to pick up a magazine find a comfy chair and settle in for the long haul.
3947,0,Not impressed My first time there The service was very slow and it was was so frustrating as we had to ask for more chips and salsa and refills of our sodas The waitress NEVER came by out table to ask us if she can refill our soda or to offer more chips and salsa  The chips and salsa were great the food was good not great  Too bad the service was so horrible  I won't go back.
3189,0,Why oh why is it so hard to find good Chinese food in this town  The two behind the counter at this place are Chinese - please don't tell me you eat the garbage that you serve to the masses in Phoenix as Chinese foodI should have read the previous review because I had a simple beef with vegetables (how could that be screwed up)  Hardly any beef the veggies were all previously frozen  The pork fried rice smelled like rotten fish  The pork is cut into tiny pieces and are extremely fatty - I'm not even sure it's pork  I did see a dead cat not far from the front door maybe he will be on tonight's special menuWahsun is not too far down 19th Ave - GO THERE INSTEAD this place SUCKS.
1932,0,We decided to try vitos the other nite based on reviews and word of mouth so i went to there web site to check out the menu i noticed they delivered and it was 15% off for first deliveryperfect  so i ordered on line with a  delivery time noted as we got close to the delivery time i called to let them know that there was a gate code to get in she said i will call the driver to let him knowperferct so came the delivery timeplus 10 minutesplus 10 more minutesplus 10 more minutesso i called back to find out where the order wasshe said   oh were sorry we thought it was for pick upWHAT THE HELL so i can't tell you how the food is BECAUSE WE NEVER GOT ANY ended up going else where A return phone call from mngt or owner might have been nice.
2034,1,I was surprised that they have such a great happy hour they call it Aloha hour  But come early because it gets packedThe chocolate souffle is a MUST every single time I go to Roy's  Order it early because it takes them a little while to make the oozing cakes of goodnessI could live off of their souffle  Can't wait to come back for more.
4952,0,You know when you see someone and they look really good and you think they are cool and want to hang out with them and halfway through your first conversation with them you realize that they really don't have a character and they are really nothing but looks This is exactly what RA is for sushi Lots of fanfare and no essence.
4114,0,Although i love Ponchos and the food is awesome i hate the take out girls They mess up every time we get take out They have no respect for customers and employees I don't feel comfortable calling and complaining every time and i mean EVERY TIME they forget something in my bag or mess the whole order up I live in laveen and by time i get home I'm not going back for a mistake that happens way too often Example: I go yesterday to get our evening dinner Made it simple but we did order a lot I paid with my credit card Well i checked my bag before i left the window Strike 1: half pint of chili i ordered wasn't in there but they insisted it was Oops try again Strike 2:  I ask for my receipt not credit card receipt but the food receipt showing what i ordered Response to that was well ummmmmmm when you use your credit card the only receipt you get is the transaction one you sign My response is no that's wrong i want my food receipt She refused Strike 3: when she closed the window on my face WWJD Walk away i guess I had my hands full my two kids with me and I was very tired I'm over it Take out window will not see me for a while I hope Ponchos management looks into a customer service class for these ladies because these ladies acting like that now at such a young age will find out real soon when life hits them as adults that they need to be CLASSY.
4443,0,"This review is primarily for the Wine Cellar and corporate offices The Cellar-Master is awful arrogant and condescending I've been a long time customer of this and other AJ's throughout the valley and have spent HUNDREDS maybe even thousands of dollars on premium liquor at their stores I've been on the hunt for a particularly hard-to-find liquor even ensuring that my name was added to the running ""list"" for distribution (I was told I was "
3087,0,Bad food expensive not worth the moneyI got a to-go of falafel starter and 2 chicken  combo platter and i regret spending $ 35 on this tasteless meal The pita bread was cold and i opened up the box 5 minutes after getting the foodWill prefer Greek Wraps/King Gyros to this place which are economical and tasty.
3909,0,Not impressed at all Rice is under cooked crab puffs were inconsistent either huge and super cheesy or a tiny folded crisp Shrimp tasted weird The delivery guy kind of spilled the sauce so the bottom of the bag was drenched Delivery speed was mediocre Don't think I'll order from here again unless I'm desperate.
919,1,Met 2 friends here for lunch and the place just keeps getting better The hot and sour soup was amazing Filled with lots of roast pork shrimp tofu and veggies with the perfect amount of spice I just wish I lived closer The prices have gone up a bit but $599 & $699 is still a bargin for the quality and quantity of food.
4368,0,Bleh Bland tasteless pizza squishy pasta watery sauce The service was lackluster and the music is LOUD Such a bummer since it is so close to my house.
2806,0,I should have went to the Safeway next door for sushiThis was the first time I went to sushi joint looked at the menu and decided that the best sounding thing was the steak I opted for the grilled salmon and wasabi mash While I am a huge sushi fan the price of the rolls were a wee bit more expensive than some GOOD sushi places I went to My friend opted for a bento box that had a crab nigiri (which was simply a half a stick of imitation Krab on top of rice) So sad My plate arrived and looked like a garden threw up on my plate The steamed veggies were scattered around my plate like the salad shooter malfunctioned The grilled salmon was just okay served on top of wasabi mash that was also just okay The server was also very clueless She brought over a bowl of miso soup and sat the soup between my friend and I I wasn't sure who it belonged to so I asked for straws so we could share =) She didn't think it was too funny She said she wasn't sure whose meal it came with so she just left in the middle so we can figure it out (THANKS)By the way the waitresses were wearing traditional Chinese dresses Shouldn't they be in a kimono or something Who is the smart white guy that owns this placeI walked away from Zen 32 and I won't be back.
3073,1,A Salon Experience as it is meant to be  Excellent service and exceptional stylists  Ask for color specialist Sarah.
2213,1,Stingray has THE BEST sushi happy hour Delicious Vegas and Dragon rolls for $5 each Sit at the sushi bar the sushi chefs are super nice and you get complimentary miso soup and edemame.
3403,0,"I have been in Rod Works twice and each time I was disappointed  The decor that Rod Works offers is just Ross finds remarked and overpriced  The staff needs some serious lessons in customer service  I was never greeted asked if I was looking for something in particular or thanked for my purchase (don't worry I wont be purchasing anything from there again)  On my last visit I asked if I may set a breakable item at the counter that I wished to purchase so that I could continue to shop and was regarded in a snotty tone by a woman standing behind the counter that she ""didnt work there""  I get the impression that this store is just a hobby for some spoiled housewife who's husband has a real job and instead of taking care of her home and children she sits behind the counter of her store gossiping and ignoring customers  If I want to be treated poorly and be ignored Ill just shop at Walmart  More than likely I will find the same items for sale at a fraction of the cost."
2238,1,Three words: bacon infused meatloaf I could end my review right now and that would be all you'd need to know to make your decision I am shocked this place has a 35 star average because my experience here was nothing short of 5 stars The atmosphere here is casual but classy and it's the perfect location for a date night or a night out with family or friends The open kitchen allows the guest to see the chef create the masterpiece and the staff is extremely friendly every step of the way But the food is really what makes this place a 5 star in my book I don't often eat meatloaf but when I do I want it to be sublime This was more then sublime it was heaven with every bite I don't know how they infused bacon into the meatloaf but there was a delicious taste of bacon with every single bite I also liked the fact that I could order a half order and trust me the half order is still extremely large The burger here is also spectacular as well as the Mo' Rockin Shrimp with chili-beer dipping sauce dough balls This restaurant is a hidden gem and one I wish I made my way to more often PS - for all you locals out there the vibe of Cookin' Jacks still lingers and in a good way It brings back memories.
4600,0,lied about wait time  billing department is nightmare  calling to collect when it was already paid don't go there.
4034,0,NEVER  go for anything other than a hangnail Then make sure your manicurist goes with you  Didn't follow through with test ordered  Would not admit error  I'm not sure what medical schools these Drs graduated from but coming from a medical family wouldn't let my dog go there (if I had one)  I'll make sure to pay any co-pay the same way they followed through with my tests.
4521,0,"We had a Groupon so figured we'd make the trip for a sweet deal on Sushi didn't work out that way We decided on a couple of rolls with macadamia nuts because wellwho doesn't like macadamia nuts Rolls come no nuts Even though it clearly lists them on the menu not one roll has a nut We ask the server about it and she says they don't include nuts on the rolls ( and apparently don't ask if you want them) because of the allergy risk Which assumes people can't read and makes zero sense I noticed you had no issues with the cream cheese what about about the lactose intolerant peopleSo she brings us out a small bowl of stale nuts and we put them on the sushi which ruins it We'd had a couple of bites before we dumped the crappy stale nuts on the sushi so I was ok with paying for it and getting out of the place So I call the issue to the servers attention she says ""let me go get my manager"" and this ""manager"" never comes out I was simply looking for some reassurance that the nuts would be thrown out and no else would want to puke on their food but that was too much to ask Paid the bill and left."
26,1,This is one of the nicest spas I have ever been to  I went here for the first time several years ago before the remodel and it was way smaller and not a very memorable experienceHowever with the remodel the facility is AMAZING  They have a beautiful relaxation room where you can lay down with cuddly blankets and read take a nap or eat some yummy snack mixes that are laid out  It has a steam room and sauna and awesome showers with showerheads everywhere  There is also a little outdoor private area with jacuzzi and outdoor showersI had a stone massage which I hoped would never end  When you walk into the room they give you a choice of around 5 different mixes to listen to on their ipod depending on your mood  I thought that was pretty cool too  The staff was very attentive and friendly  I wish I could have had more time to use the gym there too that looked really nice also  I would highly recommend spending a day at this spa  Oh and I think they have a summer special right now where you can show your AZ driver's license and get 40% off  That's a pretty great savings considering it's not a cheap place to get a massageMake a day of it you won't be disappointed.
2398,1,Love this place The individual booths are creatively displayed and prices are reasonable What an interesting array of decor collectiblesetcAlso love the music and friendly staff.
1453,1,We are so happy with the services they took care of a black alage problem that we had for years and no one else seemed to know how -looks great They have such amazing customer care the staff is so caring and trusting about not only the pool but for us as well.
3380,0,Please read previous posts for the complete storyI have currently handed out over 500 flyers and spoke with 43 people over the weekend 97 total people about never using this company If these guys new anything about business they would know it takes 4-7 positive experiences to get 1 new customer and 2-3 negative to prevent 5-7 new customers from ever trying the companyKeep up that poor customer services quike & cleanThis time next year Scottsdale Az might have a new place to shop in place of the fraud wash.
4711,0,I've been to half the Filibertos in Phx since the first one opened While living on the East Coast I yearned for a late night Fili run and would do so whenever visiting I've moved back and been to this location at Gilbert and Baseline and foolishly keep going back Here are my grievances:Prices way upQuality so so (usually just a bean and cheese burrito but cold and for $403)Attitude C'mon It's Filibertos Don't judge me at the counterBottom line is two bean burritos with cheese and a medium drink for $1250 I may as well be in NYC And then the attitude Just don't need it I'll hit Ricardos up the road :)I'll keep hitting Filis here and there but this one is finally gone over the top and lost me They just don't care There are plenty of folks driving thru and their tills are running over Clearly there is no pressing need to maintain a charade of friendly service to mix with their high-priced fast food.
2067,1,Thanks to Flashbash my daughter's first birthday party was a success Allison came in and set up so quickly The equipment was so easy to use Their prices are great and they were very efficient Thanks.
211,1,"Hungry Monk is the newest addition to my ""I wish it were in the city"" list This place features craft beers on draft and it's not like that range of places that offer whatever keg is going to sell the best because they want the money This guy stocks beers that are actually interesting hard to find and really worth the trip I had a Lost Abbey Judgement Day and my girlfriend had the Dead Bastard which is basically just an Arrogant Bastard and a Rogue Dead Guy mix not a complitation between the two breweries I found this a bit odd but whatever I didn't have any food but this place definitely gets it when it comes to beers."
3478,0,"I have been here on multiple occasions and each time the customer service leaves a lot to be desired Their selection in 38s-40s seems pretty limited I've been twice now when I was looking for a particular color / style When asked if I needed any assistance the answer to ""yes I'm looking for x type of jacket in x color"" should not be to say ""hold on a few minutes while I"" do something and then to leave your customer waiting 10+ min for an answerSave yourself the hassle and go check out pretty much anywhere else I hear they sell jackets and suits at the thrift stores At least there I'm expecting to be ignored and have to fend for myself when trying to find something."
4129,0,This place was terrible The first thing that I noticed when I sat down was the floor was wet I figured they had just mopped boy was I wrong As I was sitting there during my meal a drip of water caught my eye I looked up and the duct work was leaking There was water all over the exposed duct work in the ceiling and it was leaking on floor Gross imagine if that landed in my food or on me Now about the food First it was way over priced Each item is sold separately I looked at the drink menu and almost fell over A cocktail is on average $8 I ordered the 5 cheese melt (sounds yummy right WRONG) When the sandwich came to the table it looked horrible Just a large mound of cheese on tiny bread When I opened the sandwich the inner layers of cheese weren't even melted I took a bite (thinking it was going to clog my arteries the whole time) and it didn't even have any flavor A grilled cheese I make at home tastes better I didn't even finish a half of a half and the waitress never even acknowledge that I didn't even touch my meal I will never go here again Moral of the story overpriced gross food and who knows whats dropping into the food as it's being walked around the room.
4872,0,"After two negative experiences I wanted to give this location another chance only to be severely disappointed once againUpon walking into the door I am greeted (if you can call it that) with a ""What's the last name"" The girl behind the counter obviously could care less about customer service since she gave less than none Not even a hint of a smile The girl looked as if she were going over everything else she would rather be doing in her head I felt not only unwelcome but disrespected as a paying customerI came with a friend who had never done a spray tan before and I let the girl explain to her how to do it I myself have worked in a tanning salon for over 5 years and every direction that the girl gave my friend was 100% wrong To keep my friend from having her spray tan ruined I explained the correct way for her to apply barrier cream pose etc When it came my turn for the spray tan I stepped into the booth onto the metal plate and was pracitcally standing in a puddle (a problem I had had before) I went up to the front and asked (very politely) if she could please wipe down the plate because it was still very wet Not only did the girl roll her eyes at me but she did not entirely wipe the plate I was still standing in wetness during my sprayOn top of everything else I ended up having water drip on me from the ceiling of the booth due to the fact that the machine had not been properly wiped down after sanitization Any vet spray tanner will know how detrimental having water drip on you during a spray tan can be It goes without saying that I will not be returning to this location any more and neither will my friend If any managers are reading this and are interested to know who the girl was that was working I visited on 10/7/12 at 6 pm at the Tempe location."
1826,1,Absolutely my favorite place in town Best bruschetta EVERRR Oh and when you go ask for Miles -- he's the most amazing server ) and quite handsome too I might add.
2445,1,Had to check out Bianco prior to moving away from Phoenix It was as good as advertised Wait time wasn't too bad Go for a few drinks at the bar next door and your time will fly by  Biancoverde Wiseguy Rosa and Margherita pizzas were shared amongst friends By unanimous decision Margherita was the top choice It was clean and balanced I would definitely order it many times overTip: Add prosciutto americano onto the Margherita pizza and feel the flavor explode in your mouth Your taste buds will thank you.

1248,0,"If your over 55 and enjoy overpriced ""Happy Hour"" food then this is your place It is also cramped and crowded at the bar and I spotted a good number of those fruit fleas swirling around the bar area Place caters to the well heeled and sweater wearing crowd and although it was Monday Night football no volume was on the small TV and nobody but me was really interested in the game The least expensive food for HH is 6 bucks and that is bowl of soup Other dishes that came out looked like the ole tiny portions at HH prices swaperoo I tried their famous Huckleberry margarita and although not bad it came out of a machine and a swirl of huckleberry or something similar was put on top of drink Nothing here at this place warrants a return viisit and they should work on that fruit fly problem beacuse that is a major issue swatting them away sitting at the bar."
4882,0,"My wife and I had friends visiting from California so booked some spa appointments about a month out and planned to spend the day at the pool  Luckily (we thought) my wife called to confirm the appointments the week before and found that they had both the times and the treatments wrong  The spa representative corrected them and we thought all was well  As we were driving up to the hotel at about 1:10 for our 2:00 appointments the telephone rang asking where we were and why we weren't there yet  We explained the earlier mixup and that our appointments were actually at 2:00  The reply was ""sorry there is nothing we can do now"" We asked to see the manager and got a ""really sorry we don't have any openings""  Apparently the Biltmore is not responsible for their own ineptitude  Half our group ended up getting no spa treatments at all  Guess what they offered us in compensationthey covered the spa gratuitygee thanks  After ruining our day you covered the gratuity for your own employees  No discount no promise of future compensation nada  I'd like to mention that all areas of the spa have the styling of a high school locker room crossed with a Motel 6  Sad     We wandered over to the pool to use the cabana we had rented for the day for about $250  The last time the cabanas were renovated was about 1986 based on the condition and the decor  I'm not sure how they were able to acquire the frost-filled fridge from my college dorm room but there it was right along with the 20 year old tube TV The interior was in bad need of painting as there was peeling and mildew in many areas  It really takes away from the whole experience  Sorry Biltmore you are a shade of your former self       My advice is to drive a few miles to Montelucia where you will find an elegant up to date spa with great therapists for the same price  The pool and cabanas there are absolutely beautiful."
847,1,Mongolian BBQOn the NW corner of Thomas & 15th AvenueLove this place  If you go here get the Stir Fry in the frontI love to add my own ingredients into my bowl which they take from you & stir it all up with the sauce of your choice Very hearty lots of food Always hot & fresh Very friendly.
766,1,been coming to this location for years  great service and a good cut for a very reasonable price  I always get the MVP that comes with hot towel service during the shampoo sitting in a massage chair and them a shoulder/back massage after  You can't beat that for about $20Bridget is da bomb there I go once a month for my fix  buy a season pass and you get 6 mvp's for the price of 5.
1100,1,Two more trips since my last review and I still stand at 5 stars Both times were with groups of friends  On one of my ventures here I was with a group who decided to try the family style  We had 2 fish dinners (amok & the mango) both were very very delicious  Loved the flavorings  We also had a couple of the chicken dishes and a cold sliced beef with vegetablesI suggested to the 2nd group since they were not familiar with Cambodian foods to order family style   Since I know pretty much what I like I wanted to order my own  I ordered the fish mango again  Had my standard mango bo bo and ended up taking about half my fish home for a late night snackWill be returning next week again with another group of eaters  LOLNever tasted anything here that I didn't like  I guess that the fish is my favorite It is a hard choice thoughService is excellent but just be prepared especially with groups that the food is prepared fresh and it may take some time before you get your dish  They do not bring all dishes at once as that would involve them sitting in the kitchen while they prepare the other dishes Nobody wants food that has stood and is not hotWhat else can I say except that I just LOVE eating here and will keep recommending it to my groups of friendsI just keep coming back.
3035,0,Decided to try this establishment on a Friday night and was highly disappointed The food was incredibly bland and over cooked I tried the 'legendary' fried rice with veggies and tofu The tofu was not prepared correctly (read mushy like mashed potatoes) and the only extra veggies were snap peas My husband tried the Thai street noodles It was basically yaki soba noodles with a spice and was clearly not Thai His noodles were so over cooked they were almost crunchy Our server topped the experience off with not knowing how to describe the food and alcohol menu Should have known this place was a bust since there were 3 other patrons dinning Save you self time and money don't bother with this place.
387,0,I had a terrible moving experience with S & M movers and United Every load they delivered was crushed or in pieces My kitchen table was unable to be repaired For an unknown reason they had disassembled the base of the table and when they delivered it there were missing pieces and they were unable to assemble it They wanted to compensate me $48 for a table that was $1000 brand new  Furthermore I'm now stuck with trying to get rid of a broken table and the four chairs which is difficult because I do not have a way to transport it (Thus the reason I hired movers to begin with)  My most fragile and valuable item was my road bike  I very carefully packaged it for the move and it arrived partially disassembled with damage to the gears  The compensation they offered to fix it was $35not even close to what it will cost I would assume there would be some damage when moving items 2000 miles across country but the condition of my furniture and boxes was unacceptable Try another company and hopefully you'll have better luck.
3864,0,I heard lots of good stuff regarding this place so I decided to check it out and here's what I concluded1 Space: first of all this place is really really really tiny so sitting situations are way too close for comfort  I recommend small party with 4 people max2 Menu: just because its listed does not mean its available3 Quality: not so great my hash browns were burnt (more like hash blacks) and the rest of the food too greasy I myself is not a big fan of Fat4 Beverage: uh I rather go to Circle K and get a cup5: Service: ok but for such a limited customers how can service go wrongAll in all I was not impress with this place  I even went back for lunch thinking maybe it was only during breakfast that this place lacked the hype that everybody was talking about but once again I very disappointed  BTW i like my Burger with Butter and not Butter with Burger.
2720,1,The food here is amazing Everything I have had has been great Burgers breakfast huge sandwiches It can get really busy but is always worth the wait Quality food and good service.
3958,0,Yelp rarely steers me wrong but this time it happened I ordered take-out and was so disappointed The hot and sour soup was neither hot nor sour The crab puffs were some of the worst I have had weak and soggy with no crab The mu shu chicken lacked flavor and I honestly think they used tortillas instead of crepes (I couldn't taste any sesame oil) The pricing was a bit high and the place was a dump I'll stick to China Chili in the future.
3430,0,This is my worst experience at a Sonic The location is hard to reach the service is real slow and even though it is all set up for a drive-thru there is no drive-thru window I felt like I could have gone to Applebees ordered ate and left before I got my meal from this Sonic location If you ever have to endure a meal at this location you may be as shocked as I was at how impossible it seems to be to access - it's almost like they don't want customers.
2105,1,This place is awesome Delicious food Portions are slightly on the smaller side but the quality is so great that it makes up for it Seriously you cannot go wrong with this one Great atmosphere as well Cool decor.
910,1,Michelle Duvall is amazing  I love my nails  She did a pink and white back fill and I'm not the easiest cline to please  I normally go home and refile my nails the way I want them done  I like thatshe was punctual and even finished me in less then 50 min  I pre poked my next appointment and am sending my friends to her  Thanks Michelle.
2024,1,3rd ThursdayWOOHOO  what a concept I really love it I just wish I know more local streets to figure out and plan better for the game but it's tough for out of towner like me Still I had awesome time running boozing and chillin with likeminded folks in Tempe I agree with other Yelpers BEST to buy the shirt & beer mug kit before the race  Oh and store workers were great very knowledgeable and had good selection of shoes & items to empty out my wallet before my flight home thx Get some.
397,1,Must be patient Restaurant ran by literally two people  Great food worth the wait   Enpanadas tamales way to go Their ceviche awesome too.
2886,1,First time here was great I walked in just to see what the place was like and was immediately greeted by Joe  Super chill dude answered a lot of questions all while working on a piece for someone else  I began to ask if he could help me fix one of my tattoos and then we talked about my (hopefully) soon-to-be sleeve  I already have a cupcake tattoo and wanted to get a friend for it so Joe drew one up in a couple of minutes and I was thrilled It was super cute and exactly what I was looking for  He was poking me with needles and ink shortly thereafter and when he saw that my existing cupcake needed a little touch up he offered to fill in the spot for free and added some sprinkles:) What a great first time experience  My newest edition is healing up very nicely hardly had any itching or scabbing and it looks great  I will be coming back to Joe for my sleeve for sure.
4766,0,Food-Great  Beer-Great  Service-Absolutely Terrible  Ryan M was our server and everything was a challenge drink refills happened finally as checks came along took 15 minutes to get credit card processed and never even offered desert  It is a shame that such a good restaurant had such terrible service.
292,1,I've never walked into a store like Walgreens and been greeted with such enthusiasm and and warmth  I only came in buy some water but I was greeted once upon walking into the store another time while walking down an aisle and the cashier was gushing with customer service and wished me well as I walked out the doorColor me super impressed.
238,1,Fish Machaca it may sound weird and when they explain it as steamed seasoned fish as the healthy option you may be suspicious  Don't be it is an amzing flavor and texture filling with in a simple corn tortilla Part of the fun here is the salsa/ slaw bar Yes slaw 2 types sauces salsa and more to customize your taco as you want it The sesame chili oil goes best of the fish machaca as anything heavier would mask the savory flavors  The fried fish was done well too not over cooked and crispy  You are are not in to seafood your only option is a quesadilla but I think this place may get you in to seafoodMy only grip is the price to amount of food Tacos are $3 each and 2 of them make a small meal.
1902,1,I love tory burch My first paycheck post grad I bought myself a pair of Revas at the tory burch in sf I went in yesterday and bought my first tory bag and got it with my $50 off birthday coupon and was offered water and diet coke I love the whole shopping will be back her post first nursing paycheck and do some damage maybe buy a simon cardigan i've been eyeing.
4429,0,I have been here on a few occasions and I was pleased with the selection pricing and customer service but sadly that seems to have gone away Items were on par with Flo's as another reviewer commented and for the selection I have been seeing this does not quite match up I was not greeted by the three ladies at the counter but was rather glared at there was no hello or smiles just a pack of elderly women standing in formation looking me right in the eye as I stroll in Wow welcoming right The more hidden gem seems to be in the warehouse where items are marked down significantly There is less furniture in this area than in the store however Televisions clothing and random items seem to be the majority in the warehouseThere are some cool vintage finds to be found but after being treated like a leper and leaving aggravated I would rather stick to other mom and pop thrift stores and the better Goodwill locations in the valley I don't understand why they would act this way when you want to make visitors feel welcome so they can spend money for a worthy cause I was completely turned off and I won't be returning This is not the only worthy cause in the world 1 star for crappy service and visit the Goodwill on Pima in Scottsdale if you have the time and gas.
1083,1,It's huge you can get lost and not come out without buying something also the food in the cafeteria is all fresh and delish try out their corn bread and also the grilled fish Even if I'm not planning to buy anything new for my place I simply love to walk around just for the exercise and to admire anything new they have out.
388,1,Paul is unbelievable Very helpful Conscientious about how much you will be spending but also wants to do things right He very clearly outlined my options even over the phone - including options of not using his services When he did come I could see that he was very particular and did the job very carefully and completely The job started taking longer than he expected but he insisted on me paying him for the original guesstimate of time Very patient very helpful very good at explaining what he is doing He has been in the specific RO business for years and takes pride in what he does I can't say enough good about this man I found him on Yelp and saw all the good reviews and thought I'd give him a try I'm glad I did I would recommend calling him and talking to him You will know right away that he is the man for your job.
359,1,Amazing.
2800,0,We are usually HUGE fans of ethnic marketplaces and food courts wherever we travel but a word of caution here is needed  My partner became violently ill after the combo plate here yesterday  He had the birria and the red chili with beef and potatoes  I had the  carnitas plate and was fine  If the food looks like its been on the line too long it probably has been.
1785,1,Love this place  Everyone is friendly and the coffee is so good  They have good frozen coffee drinks and pretty decent food for a coffee shop  Good urban environment also They also have a punch card.
692,1,Awesome music super friendly Barista's delicious treats yummy satisfying beverages friendly regulars and plenty of room (when you consider the picnic tables outside as well - nice weather and sunlight permitting) The best in-house-made chai and whipped cream i've probably ever had I also love those lucky evenings when i go in & there is someone baking deliciousness that fills the place up with enticing aromasPS I'm definitely one of those people who will come to Lux to study or do homework for 3 sometimes 4 hours for those of you who complain about customers like myself maybe you should consider that we may spend about $20 a week there and are valuable customers to Lux - just like you are If my books are over crowding where a chair is and you would like to sit there please just ask I'd be happy to make room for others and share space.
1750,0,I heard great things about Hillside Spot from a friend I will never consider his recommendations againThe service was terrible Our waiter fucked everything up everything Forgetful messed up each order The family next to us had similar problems but worse Waiter gave all the kid's food to another table So the parents were already done eating when their kids finally received their grub The food was nothing special Maybe worth 25 stars This Spot was boo boo I've had better experiences at Waffle House.
8,1,This place is great I love their mint chocolate chip yummmy They have a bit size cup for 299 and it always gets loaded up love it.
4241,0,"If you like sushi go somewhere else I was extremely disappointed in the quality of both the service and the food I decided to take my family here because the other reviews seemed good however either my experience was an anomaly or the other Phoenix yelpers and I have stark differences in tasteThe staff had great smiles yet lacked follow through We had to ask for water and extra ginger twice The sushi rolls were the flimsiest I have ever seen Although poor in quality they were high in price for what they serve I'm not sure about the names of some of their rollsone was named ""Climax"" Gross and just distasteful  The decor and ambiance leave you wanting They have three different wallpapers hanging and the music is overwhelming Even though this is the only sushi bar in Surprise I will gladly drive to Peoria or Scottsdale the next time I have a craving for sushi."
375,1,Now this is what I'm talking about  I've been waiting for JA to open since I used to frequent the one back in IL when I lived there My girlfriends and I had lunch there today Not only was the meal delicious but the service was off the hook -- thanks LukeThe ladies and I were all jonesin' for the rotisserie chicken Loved it I substituted the mashed potatoes for the vine ripened tomatoes Yum  And get this -- I wanted some of their skinny french fries and jokingly (well sort of) asked Luke to snag a few for me from the kitchen  After a couple of minutes he showed up with a plate of fries for all of us to share  And not that I wasn't full already we shared the white chocolate cheesecake with raspberry sauce for dessert IncredibleFive stars all the way for J Alexanders Looking forward to heading back soon.
3587,0,This place could not last in any other major city The service can be appalling The food is basic and very expensive Quite possibly the loudest piano on earth.
1480,1,You just can't get pizza like this  The taste and quality is top notch  Don't complain about the wait  They got a bar right next door with appetizers and drinks which makes the time fly by like your not even waiting  The system they have runs great they take very good care of all of their customers  Come relaxed and just enjoy the experience this place is easily one of the top 10 pizzerias in the country.
4727,0,The food is amazing The servers are great The hostesses are not informed on what's going on But the reason I'm giving them a 1 star review is because the manager Mils (I believe that was his name and as he informed me he's the ONLY manager they have) is quite possibly the rudest most condescending person ever Dude you're in the industry of CUSTOMER service Learn how to properly interact with people I will NEVER go back based on him solely him I tell everyone I know not go there because of him I have never been treated so poorly after making a reservation for 20 3 weeks in advance and being told upon arrival that they had no table ready because no one had made a reservation when their hostess had called literally an hour and a half before to confirm that we were still coming He was so incredibly rude about it talked down to me telling me I didn't know what I was talking about I was wrong and I must have made up the reservation until I played him the message from the hostess at which point he just walked away The owner stepped in and asked tables to move so they could get our group in We still waited for over 45 minutes UGH I work in the restaurant industry I can NOT imagine treating people this way and expecting them to return SO BAD I would highly suggest improving your customer service skills Mils You're awful.
4356,0,"Had a horrible experience there tonight  To put this in perspective I rarely say that about any restaurant   We had a Groupon and went based on good reviews on this site  Four of us went to dinner there- Three of us ordered glasses of red wine  Wine was warm in all three glasses and had rather skimpy pours  The bottle we ordered later was good temperature though- Ordered Bruschetta and the Cheese plate  They made a mistake on the order  No big deal and sent back the order  However 30 seconds later someone other than our server (the manager) brought us the very same plate we just sent back  Sent that back  30 seconds later the waiter shows up and proceeds to tell us what we ordered-- which he had wrong  Once we got the right order they were good (although-- the bruschetta bread was not toasted all that well)- Egg Plant Lasagna Short Ribs and Margherita Flat bread were good- I ordered the prosciutto copa and brie sandwich which was listed under the WOOD FIRED SANDWICHES  I got a cold sandwich with mediocre bread Yes I should have sent it back and would have if either the manager or our waiter would have showed up at some point after bringing us our orders By the way the place was mostly empty at this point- As noted above we had a Groupon with a value of approx $175 which included 4 drinks 2 appetizers 4 ""entrees"" and 1 dessert  We had those and ordered a bottle of wine on top of that bringing the bill to approx $181 w/out subtracting the value of  the Groupon   Waiter brings the bill which should have been approx $6 (after subtracting the Groupon value)  We explained several times to him that it should be approx $6 not $181  Our guests were going to cover the difference plus the tip on their credit card  What charge comes back  You guessed it $181  Even after correcting the mistake it was approx $15 (assume the diff was taxes)  - ""Free"" valet is really not necessary given the parking is all of about 20 feet from the door  However the valet attendant was very nice and had our cars ready even before we got out there- Even after all the screw ups our server boasting about how great everything is and fishing for a big tip we got no apologies for any of the mistakes they madeNeedless to say I will never go to this place again This experience could be an anomaly but I'd be surprised if they're still in business 6 months from now."
714,1,We LOVE   Jersey Mikes We love the club sub Mike's Way If you think Subway makes good subs then you will just die when you eat a Jerzy Mike's sub The taste is completely different it's like comparing apples to oranges Also the employees will laugh and joke with you I don't know if that's part of their job description but I like it They always remember me & they always give me a free cookie with my sub The prices are much higher that Subway but for what you get the price is actually lower Not to mention that it is SO much better Once you try Jerzy Mikes you'll never go back to Subway again.
478,1,So good Lots of interesting flavors all natural ingredients very clean and spacious eating area and great customer service Will definitely go back.
920,1,Great bank Very nice employees although a slightly weird location Its located in Scottsdale next to a pizza shop and a best buy in a strip mall I came in they printed me checks really quickly and called it a day Thanks everyone.
276,1,I worked with Chad from Mr B's Moonwalk for my kids' birthday party last weekend From start to finish I received nothing but the utmost professionalism and personal service You can tell he really enjoys the service he provides to families and makes an extra effort to make sure his customer is satisfied with their service I ordered a castle bounce house along with tables and chairs for our party at the park He was prompt the bouncer was clean and it made it really easy to be able to have them deliver tables and chairs tooThis was the 2nd time we have used Mr B's and this experience was even better than the first 2 years agoI will definitely use them next time I need a bounce house.
557,1,Went to eat in by myself at lunch  Tried the panko chicken with tonkatsu sauce  YUM  Mama san stopped by and drop off the real verison of asian tonkatsu sauce  WOW  It was much better  BYW - tonkatsu = japanese BBQ sauce  Can not wait to go back soon.
851,1,What a great place Went to a wine tasting there Great wine and food Atmosphere fun check it out.
3824,0,After two visits - terrible  Cochinita Pibil tacos dry and tasteless  And with French fries  Guacamole should be advertised as chopped (at least as well as you can with a spoon by a server who told us it was a pain to do guacamole tableside when it was busy) avocado not guacamole  Service seemed just plain uninterested  Prices not justified at all for what you are going to experience.
1157,1,Best vegan option in the valley  Love that I can go out to eat and still be healthy  I almost always order one of the specials love the variety.

4681,0,"I used to be a regular here at Gallo Blanco although I have to say this place has gotten a little brazen We took our sister in law for her birthday and arranged for a table of six we also asked the hostess if the outside tables were first come first serve She stated to us it was first come first serve We purchased a margarita at the bar and asked for an extra shot of Tequilla in which the bartender charged me $600 plus the $500 for the Margarita then did a no sale and just collected the cash We then proceeded to sit outside and have our cocktail the hostess immediately came outside and told us in a very rude manner "" you can't sit there"" I know you have reservations  but all these tables on the outside are reserved"" the hostess left  we were miffed we asked another waitress if the tables were first come first serve and she said yes We decided to take our dinner party to Hillstone where people treat you with dignity I guess Gallo Blanco  has such great crowd that they feel they don't have to have any decorum Sad for you guys it's not worth it anymore."
1166,1,My boyfriend friends and I are a part of the PBR Bowling League held at this location every Sunday night The employees are GREAT Very welcoming and accommodating Food is awesome especially for a bowling alley and we ALWAYS have a blast (Might not bowl great all the time but we never leave disappointed with service and hospitality) Go Team  :D.

1715,1,I've been hearing about these cheesecakes from my husband and his incessant twitter following and I was really excited to try some of the goods at the market this past SaturdayWe finally woke up early enough on a Saturday morning to hit up Matt's and then peruse the market before it got too hot  We made our way over to the cheesecake table and then debated between 10 or so flavors  He had key lime and chocolate chip out to sample and I decided to try the key lime  I was amazed at how natural it tasted  There was nothing artificial about it it just tasted exactly like it should  These are very good very simple cheesecakes  I ultimately went with the peanut butter chocolate chip which is extremely tasty  There are a bunch of different sizes to choose from all at very fair prices  YUMMY.
623,0,This was my hope for a  good get away and it did nothing for me  Just to take the kids out and enjoy a day near the waterService was fine being seated inside with pretty girls  It's a big dated but it's better to sit outside for sure for more room  Waitresses were nice but very slow  Tea refills per few and far between and food was not worth the money  Food did come in a timely fashionOnion Rings were very bland and simple and would not order them againNacho's with pork and beans on them was not even close to very good  The best thing on the chips was the real cheese sour cream and jalapeno'sBlue Cheese Burger was just par  Nothing to write home about unless it's on YelpI won't be going back especially since I paid $600 to get into the part to eatI hope the owners and managers read Yelp  I would hope you would try to spice things up more  People want a place to go and have a decent food ice cream for the kids and alcohol for all the others  This could be a killer location and place but I have been very spoiled by Antelope Marina at Lake Powell.
3645,0,I would rate less if given chance I purchased a deal on living socialCom for yard-work First I contacted them by email and after 2 days no response I figured they must be busy well after 4 days had to call them I ended speaking with Michael the owner On first impression he seemed like a good guyBut from the get go you can tell he is in over his head He doesn't keep you informed and after first contact you end up chasing him to get anything from info on appt or what is needed to just speaking with him Now after scheduling was made he couldn't make first appt And had to reschedule so by that point I figured I could help him out and just leave dogs inside with side gate unlocked while I wasn't home Fine with me Anyway asked him to try and see if sprinklers could be replaced Well for the sake of my thumb I will just end this with saying that when I looked at yard once DruWest was gone Grass was scalped whoever had hold of weed-eater needs to chill on caffeine whomever had hold of trimmer for bushes should have used it and whomever had weed kill spray should have stood up and used it instead of letting it just try to spray itself Oh ya About those sprinklers I asked about Never were touched AND TO TOP IT OFF NEVER EVEN CONTACTED ME TO TELL ME WHAT HE DID OR DIDNT DO PATHETIC NEVER AGAIN.
3424,0,Stopped in for a company department lunch big mistake terrible food and terrible serviceThe bartender was our server but bless his heart he tried we waited close to 30 minutes for our food which isn't ideal for when you're on company time I ordered a lunch special salad and with what ended up being breaded boneless deep fried chicken strips however from the menu pic it looked like they were grilled chicken strips  It wasn't so I was very disappointed but i tried to eat it and it was as bad as I knew it would beDon't go to NNY every experience i've had there has been terrible.
3386,0,This is the second time we have been to this denny's the first same thing happened Burnt bacon sausage and ham This time it was worse burnt bacon sausage ham uncooked pancakes and watered down ice tea Love denny's but never going to this one ever again Got pictures of the food if i can post it here i will.
2635,1,Stopped by for dinner on our way to a Dbacks game and never made it to the game  They have a great twist on traditional dishes and the beer selection is amazing  Great place for people watching too  Can't think of a single fault.
2275,0,I'm not a member of a gym but I wanted to take a look around and see what this one had to offer When I asked the girl behind the counter if I could look at what they have she would not let me go in without filling out a bunch of BS paperwork I'm sure it was so that some guy could walk me around waste my very precious time talking about things I already know and try to persuade me to join their gym That's not what I wanted I already had my decision made that if I saw the equipment I wanted to use that I would go ahead & join I just wanted to run in & out quickly while I had a free minute to do so and check it out Oh well I figure I just saved myself some time and money with this place I used to be with LA Fitness They are wonderful I think I may check out the Gilbert Rec Center & see what they have I'm sure they won't mind me taking a look If not I'll head back to LA which I highly recommend.
511,1,We had a great experience at this Pita Jungle  We love the food and the atmosphere  We had great service and what an affordable Happy Hour from 3-5PM Monday -Friday  I really enjoyed the Pineapple Margarita's.
4267,0,"So I hear on Thursdays Gameworks has a $10 play-all-night and $2 shots (and other misc drink specials) from 9 to close http://wwwgameworkscom/tId=1&sId=14Sweet They have a DOCWE table so I lugged my husband out and the kiddo (whose regular bedtime is midnight due to our schedules so don't even go there) Get there at 8 and decide to pass the time by getting a bite The waitress was sweet and lovely and made sure we were well taken care ofSo 9pm rolls around I want to order a drink to take with me to the table Why not I have a designated driver and kid-taker-care-of-er and its been a long week so a drink or three sounds fab ""The drink specials don't start until 10"" says the bartender ""Thats not what the sign in front says"" says I Shrug Drink specials don't start til 10 We at Gameworks like false advertisementSo I order my $10 play all night card and will be back at 10 for my drink Get the card obligatory $2 card fee and sit down at the DOCWE table One race and the card stops working We go WTF to the manager and he says some games aren't available with the card 1 We know your sign says redemption games and a few others DOCWE wasn't on that Nor is it a redemption game 2 The waitress said it was fine way to make her look like a jerk So we ask for a refund ""You want a refund on a card you've already played on"" after a few sarcastic remarks from my husband we are told our transaction had been canceledWe walked out the front door disappointed and frazzled We walked right past the sign that we had seen when we walked in no mention of the DOCWE machine and said drink specials started at 9For the record we also heard several other people complaining about the sign I took a picture of it and if my phone cooperates I'll post it here as well Melissa is right it smelled pretty bad downstairs I figured it was all the kids Dave and Busters doesn't stink and of course they will continue to get my business and the hundreds upon hundreds of dollars I sink into that damn DOCWE machine and happy hour beers."
2643,1,Love the atmosphere the patios drinks and especially the chicken lollipops  If you haven't tried them they are buffalo wings with a handy bone to hold on to while you eat  The sauce with blue cheese dressy is one for the record booksI am also a fan that they serve breakfast 7 days a week and have free wifi  This is a great place to meet for work or meet after a game  Not too stuffy but nice enough that it isn't just labeled a bar.
2615,0,I've gotten some nice haircuts at this place or at least decent  Last time I used my credit card to pay and they had trouble getting it to go through  The girl kept running it over and over  then eventually rebooted their system and ran it again  This took about as long as the cut  Later I see on my statement that I was double billed  I have talked with them in person and on the phone a few times but I still have not gotten the extra charge reversed  It's not worth my time anymoreIf you go there you will probably like your haircut but bring cash.
767,1,IF you can get in here you will love it Be warned the Breakfast and Lunch rush can get mobbed They offer a lot of different options and all that I have tried are excellent.
3026,1,The food here is a solid 3  But I'm giving them a 5 because of the following reasons: fried rattlesnake appetizer an actual working slide from 2nd to 1st floor (how cool is that) friendly staff kids eat free an absolutely huge steer by the entrance (you'd have to pay $5 at the OC fair to see this) and free cotton candy for the kids.
4724,0,No alcohol Okay But the pool tables were a little crappy and the pool sticks were way crappy If I was 18-20 this would be my hangout but its not made for people to play pool as you may expect with the word 'Billiards' in the name It really is just a loud place for kids to hang out There is nothing wrong with that but because they cater to a young crowd they don't know pool etiquette they just want to stand in big groups around each other doing not much I quickly bounced out.
4880,0,Ok I liked this place when it had coffee and I like the murals on the walls outside but the whole preachy whiny and better/cooler than you vibe is really a turn off I would normally not review a local mom and pop type place badly but I was walking by and there was a jogger passing this place and the people at Conspire made fun of him yelled at him teased him  and laughed and him as he ran by What a bunch of jerks I understand that this is not the business owners but this is the type of atmosphere they have created supported and invited Jeez I'm taking my money where the people aren't meanNot to mention the constant whining by a female there that says she's one of the owners Hey I just wanted to buy something and support a local business I don't need to know how badly you are being treated by your neighbors It's your problem deal with it.
96,1,Wow We went on 4/20/11 and were appetizer and drink hopping around Scottsdale On our way to dinner we came across this wonderful place Nothing much to look at from the outside but were pleasantly surprised open and comfortable My husband and I sat at the bar ordered a few appetizers: Pork Belly Pastrami and Crab Cakes w/ brussel sprout slawsorry I drifted off thinking about how outstanding and delicious they were Thomas our bartender who knew EXACTLY how every dish was perpared and expaining w/ such passion we can tell he loves what he does Next time the reservation will be here Looking forward to trying EVERYTHING Hope Thomas is working.

153,0,Not impressed Front desk competency is inconsistent At busy times the staff is visibly overwhelmed I've had to go back twice because of their mistakes Too bad Sonora has a monopoly Competition would be a good thing for them and the consumer The customer should not have to observe or hear their comments when assignment overload occurs The billing procedures are strange They send out separate bills for each test They have yet to figure out how to put all the charges on one sheet Just when you think you've paid all the charges more are mailed out separately A negative rating would fit Sonora just nicely.
4026,0,eeew It started with a cranky waiter who told me that if I wanted to know the specials then I should have read them on the board The food was downhill from there The entire place smelled like fried onions.
1043,1,My Wife and I love this place great salsa bar tacos and burritos Not your average mexican beans and rice kind of place.
4772,0,"What are you in the mood for  I truly suggest this place if you're looking for grade D salad and such AND if you want to leave in a clinically depressed state of mindPros:  All you can eatCons:  Why in the world would you want more than a biteEvery different lettuce bowl contained gross amounts of browning greens  While the spinach looked and tasted fresh the romaine was not the parmesan was the kind that resembles anthrax or cocaine the dressing was uber-salty and quite disgusting the bacon bits contained no trace of pig and there was no protein other than cubed ham to be found  While I can see how the entire soup/salad/pasta/fruit/pizza/ice cream/tacos package might be worth $7 and change this was a horrible buy for a person looking for a salad with some ample protein  When your name contains the word ""salad"" don't you think you should offer some good greens."
2296,1,Their pizza is consistently unique and very good  Their staff is rarely ever anything but attentive and nice  Big props to Nicole who was awesome as a server today.
3843,0,My daughter went here and ordered the sampler platter and is highly allergic to shrimp she asked to subsitute it for something else and they said no  They could put it on the side  I called the manager and they said it is not cost effective for them to do this  I called corporate and they said they do not do substitutions and they have no way to ensure there is no cross contamination with products people are allergic to  This is a scary thought  I work in a restaurant and there is away to do it  Please if you have allergies or medical issues and you are not able to have certain items do NOT go to any Black Angus  This is there company policy.
842,1,This review is for Alvadora - the spa at the Royal Palms [cue angelic voices**ahhhhhh**] The lovely presented me with a spa gift cert for three services When I arranged the appointment I asked if I could increase the massage time from 60 to 90 minutes in lieu of the second service and was told 'of course' So I booked a 90 minute stone massage and a pedicure The day of the appointment - my birthday - I was greeted with a 'happy birthday' and shown to the women's shower/changing/steam room Its not fair to call it a locker room its simply too lovely for that There is a second 'relaxation room' where you can sip tea an enjoy small bites while you wait DelightfulAs for the massage itself may I just say that it was the most relaxing 90 minutes of my life It was one of those times where time goes by much more quickly than you want I didn't want it to end The room has a vaulted ceiling with what look to be the original beams It has two tables and shower heads above each for the citrus scrubs [yikes did that sound sexy] The woman [you can ask for gender preference if you like] who worked on me - Carol I think - was great I was kept warm the whole time either by her hands holding the smooth warm stones or by the perfect weight of the covers over the rest of me I felt perfectly taken care of My 5x operated shoulders have never felt so relaxed I walked out of there and into the ahhhhmaaaazing not-locker room [stocked with everything - and I do mean everything - you might need right down to qtips shave cream and disposable razors] where an out of town guest asked me what I had done and she told me I looked stoned All of that without drugs The showers walk in and large enough for a family of 5 are similarly equipped with all of the spa products to use and enjoy Lovely As an aside I don't mean to short-change the pedi but I am a girl who has frequent pedi's so this was less of a treat than the massage which I'm less likely to get for myself It was pleasant in a nice atmosphere but nothing seriously out of the ordinary And sorry my lovely but not worth 80+ dollars There are nooks outdoors - each with lounge chairs and fireplaces - where you can relax and unwind further Or you can have lunch there with your book - which I did Menu lunch it all comes to you quickly sweetly happily Makes me wish I lived there Its quiet and lovely and is a great match to the experience itself The staff is kind and attentive and a dot on the i of the incredible experience.
4045,0,Ive been to many Texas Road houses across the country but this one was very dissapointing The food was cooked sloppily my steak was supposed to be medium rare but it was overdone and chewy and grisly my side of rice was overcooked and tasted like mush The waitress forgot everything we would ask for and had to come back several times for something as simple as steak sauce The only redeeming factor is the bread was always delicious and amazing as usual.
3186,0,I went to the resort with some expectations Sadly other than being new it could offer little incentive to ever make a return trip The casino itself seems small and cramped Try to navigate between rows of slot machines and you'll find yourself squeezing between other patrons The management has decided that unless you want to play nickel quarter or dollars you are not welcome I suppose that if you have a small casino and want to maximize your margins you eliminate the small time player who likes to bet pennies Strangest thing of all is the ATM machines that don't dispense coins For coins you have to go to the cashiers window and wait interminably for your 40 cents The dining options are oddly located off the gambling floor and the signage is horrible In an area with other gambling options avail yourself of those options and avoid Talking Stick.
753,1,Ever since I went to Tim F's I can't stop talking about this place it's just so awesome I went before noon for the lunch special unreal 3$ beer and 5$ lunch mon-thurs best turkey sandwich ever I can't wait to go back.
2384,1,Jubi  Loved the food They certainly know how to properly prepare Iranian foodWe had the most delicious:Fenesjan (pomegranate walnut stew served with rice)Khask Bademjan -  sp (fried eggplant blended into a spread served hot toped with fried onions and mint and dried whey)Yogurt Dip with cucumbers - Forgive me I forgot how to say this in farsi They cook the rice perfectly coming out how it should - not too moist not to dry lighlty scented - long grains - fluffy and zero mush consistency PerfectionThey freshly make bread everything is fresh The place is a bit old school decorated but really feels like you are walking into an elegant persian home I saw a sign for upstairs some sort of happy hour discount something but only for those sitting upstairs Worth investigating Food is not cheap but they do it right and it is delicious Also - after dinner check out the market next door It is open late and if you are lucky the owner will give you a sample of a baked sesame nut sweet bread.
3227,0,We had been regular customers of Mary Coyle going back a very long time I used to go there with my family when I was a child (at the previous location on Thomas & 15th) I went to high school with one of the Coyles My wife and I (and now my son) used to celebrate special occasions there or just sometimes for fun It was our favorite place to visit after the Fiesta Bowl Parade every yearNO MORE NEVER AGAINWe visited this evening (Saturday night November 27 2010) The place was busy so a delay could be understandable But waiting over 20 minutes with no water no service and absolutely no acknowledgment was not good - and that's just the beginningAfter finally having to flag a waitress down we waited another half hour for our ice cream However my wife's was not as requested and was missing most of one flavor (which wasn't discovered until near the bottom) Also we were rather hungry having just come from the Encanto Park 75th Anniversary celebrationWhen we commented on the problems the waitress firmly stated that since the ice cream was finished everything must have been satisfactory - and anyway it wasn't her fault as she didn't seat us she didn't make the ice cream etc When we continued (politely) with an inexperienced person who identified herself as the supervisor on duty that person stated in an argumentative tone that store policy was that any adjustment to the check after finishing was considered theft since in their eyes they had served the customer and we had eaten what was served The staff then continued that any request by us to ask for an adjustment (even a minor one which was all we sought) was attempted theft on our part regardless of service timing or other factorIn many years I have almost never encountered such miserable inappropriate and immature customer service as we did this evening If you want to spend your money take it to a place that deserves your patronage - which ISN'T Mary Coyle.
1716,0,Not a review on their food or drinks (don't really recall) but their service  I was flipped off by my waitress after leaving the restaurant  (My friend paid the bill since we were out celebrating my b-day so no clue on tip other than there was one)  I have no desire to go to a place where an employee would do that to a paying customer and I wouldn't recommend it to anyone else either.
1834,1,I had lunch there on Wednesday and I still cannot believe it was as amazing as it was Justin Y is dead on it is by far the freshest sushi I've ever had and I used to live 20 minutes from San Francisco The rolls are fun inspired and unique The seaweed isn't overpowering The portions are perfect Their lunch menu is awesome 4 pcs Hamachi 4 pcs Salmon 1 philly roll a daquari and edamame 2700 out the door  Great value in my book especially for something so fresh The guys at the bar are men of few words but they crank out quality I'm still beside myself with joy.
4536,0,Unfortunately yesterday's visit was one of the worst dining experiences I've had during my 10 years in Phoenix The food was sub-awful (seriously a cheese crisp that a 7-year-old deems inedible) the service was terrible (zero smiles and I had to basically tackle our server get the check much less some refills on water glasses) and the atmosphere was equal to that of the third lunch shift at a nursing homeI won't go back Ever.
3413,0,"Okay so I'm not really a huge McDonald's fan but I come here a lot when I bring girls for mentoring So as we are sitting and doing work out of a book on a Sunday night (paying customers) the girl that I'm mentoring is smoking her electronic cigarette (no scent and nothing harmful even airports allow them) the manager literally YELLS across the restaurant ""YOU CAN'T DO THAT"" and is completely rude and unprofessional I understand rules and don't mind abiding by them but to be rude and brash Unnecessary Not to mention my burger was cold and there was no ketchup in the containers The restaurant was practically empty and there was no line I worked in the restaurant industry for years I was absolutely disgusted We won't be coming here to do work anymore What a jerk."
4516,0,"So Ginger O and I went there for brunch  We were the only ones there and it took probably 30+ minutes to get our food  I got Eggs Benedict which didn't have any hollandaise sauce on it however the waitress gave the excuse that it was the ""French"" wayummm to say it includes hollandaise sauce then making it invisible on your plate The eggs were over cooked  It was really hot in the restaurant The service was bad took forever for the food and they just didn't seem to care  Then I found out the next day Scratch closed But that is no excuse for the bad service go out with a bangnot a ""lame"" attitude   Obviously we will not be going back."
4287,0,I love pita hummus Mediterranean food and was anxious to try this place What a huge disappointment Dressing was over spiced just burned Pita was bland Glad to see stable something in Town & Country.

2626,1,"They're back as of today and they're awesome I was turned on to the Welcome Diner by a classmate at a software training I was attending I said I was a food nerd and he told me that these guys were reopening todaySolid yelp reviews sold me and they did NOT disappointThey opened at 5:00 but I got off of class at about 4:15 so I went down there and hung around for a bit After unsuccessfully attempting to help out with their square credit card thing (they can take cards but it'll show up as the food truck because the restaurant account isn't setting up properly) I placed my order I was the first customer yay Amazingly the only other opening day jitter I saw was the ricecooker being ornery and tripping the circuit breaker repeatedly In terms of ""disasters"" that's a pretty minimal one I chose to wait for the rice to finish and get my meal all together as I needed to burn time to avoid getting out of central Phoenix back to Tucson at rush hourI had the port of call burger and a side of red beans and rice (the ricecooker worked in the end)Best burger I've had I think ever All the ingredients were high quality very nice cheddar cheese mushrooms cooked with port and garlic aioli And the bun Oh damn the bun Feathery is the best adjective No unevenness in texture light and just barely strong enough to contain the burger well maybe not entirely containThe red beans and rice were good - I'm not well versed in the craft of that dish but it was tastyBoth the other customers that ordered inside got the fried chicken biscuit sandwich with apple butter made by one of the staff They seemed very happy with their choicesThey've got beer wine and hurricanes Right now they're open Thursday-Saturday 5:0000:00pm for dinner and Saturday and Sunday from 10:00-3:00pm for brunch I snuck a peek at the brunch menu and there looked to be some tasty stuff there too They're going to work on expanding dinner service out over more of the week graduallyWhat are you doingYeah YouWhy are you still reading thisGo get a burger or something from hereBlah blah blah it's Tuesday at 9am and they're not open sure whatever maybe that excuse will fly with your family but not here mister/missy."
2949,1,"I was in Phoenix recently for the WWE Royal Rumble To kill some time that morning my friend introduced me to Portlandia on his iPad in our wretched hotel room Around 11AM we were hungry and ready to check out so we consulted Yelp for brunch options and settled on VovomeenaUpon arrival I wasn't sure if I was still in Phoenix or somehow had been transported into a Portlandia sketch As others have noted it's THAT hipster A ""flight"" of Japanese cold brewed coffee - really Even more amusing was the proud barista describing the cold brew process and the different coffees And I have no idea how he could tell the different coffees apart  it's easy with a flight of beers but coffee all pretty much looks the same But after pinching myself and realizing I was still in Phoenix I went for the flight of cold brews (When in Rome  err  Phoenix right)The food options were equally hipster with a selection of a dozen or so breakfast/brunch offerings featuring fresh locally sourced food The only thing NOT hipster about the food are the prices I typically expect places like this to be a bit pricy but Vovomeena is a VERY good value Most of the selections are in the $7-9 range I ordered the most expensive selection - the bmoc It featues a smoked pork chop waffle two eggs and a ""Portuguese Donut Tower"" (basically a funnel cake) for $995 My friend got the ""pain perdu"" - banana bread pudding french toast with a caramel glaze and choice of meat for $750 Both portions were ample and everything was delicious And even though this is counter service the service was great I joke about the barista but the kid (he looked like he was 17) was really nice and knowledgeable It reminded me of talking to a brewer (or beer nerd) at a brewpub - he had that level of knowledge And when I went back for a 16 oz cold coffee after I finished my flight he admitted he accidentally made an extra flight and asked if me and my friend wanted it Thanks dude Needless to say between 1 1/2 flights and the 16 oz coffee I was amply caffeinated for the day Of all the places we went to in Phoenix this was my favorite by far I doubt if I ever will be back in Phoenix  but if I do Vovomeena is a must stop for me."

4447,0,"""Been there - done that"" with this discrepant racket  Besides the mediocre wash jobs - the customer service in a blatant word - SUCKS  First they threw out my clothes that were slated to be taken to the dry cleaners  That car washing cost me nearly $300  I boycotted the place after the owners claimed no responsiblity  Then in a desperate moment over a year later - I had an oil change and a wash just before leaving town on a Sunday morning road trip - nothing else was open  I was told that the transmission fluid was low and it needed to be filled  Halfway up the hill on I07 North there was  pinkish crap blowing out of the tail pipe all over the back of the SUV and the idiot light on the dash indicated trouble  The diagnosis given to me by the car repairman enroute was the transmission fluid had been over filled  Nice  Of course Danny's Car Wash was not responsible  I now done with them - figuring I got off lucky with the vehicle still in tact  But you'd think I was from East Texas - the third time is really the charm  The car was ""For Sale"" and I had painted this fact on the outside of the back windows in water soluble paint  In my final heinous act - I ran it thru this car wash calling attention to the windows to the incipient attendant  He assured me it was ""No problem  We'll get you all taken care of""  The car wash complete and not outside my realm of expectation  It was rendered to me with remnants of paint still plainly on the windows and the attendent present shrugged his shoulders  When I pressed the issue he suggested I to speak to the manager  The rudimentary attendant was no where to be found  The manager appeared  Cut to the chase - they didn't even try to reclean the windows  In the final scene I was driving out of the lot with dirty windows and the entire outside staff flagrantly geering and laughing   I know sounds like the dumb chick in the horror film - but I think it's safe to say - that was the last time I left tracks in that driveway  If I could deduct stars from this business I'd give them MINUS - 5 stars  There's my experience and opinion of Danny's Family Calamity Car Wash  Check out Quick n Clean on 16th Street and Colter - Fabulous  Inexpensive  Excellent customer service."

2049,1,This has become my favorite restaurant in Scottsdale for a nice dinner out  The menu was very unique and they serve generous portions unlike most of the Scottsdale restaurants  To start our party had 5 people and we had reservations on a Saturday night  We were seated immediately upon check-in something that many of the nice steak houses and other restaurants still can't quite figure out  We all started with a glass of beer which they have a great beer and wine selection  They carry many great choices at reasonable pricesOur group split the quesadilla of the day which was very good  It changes so I can't remember the actual ingredients but one of the better quesadillas I have hadFor the main course I had the pork porterhouse which does not appear to be on the menu currently  It was great  The side came with potatoes au gratin but was a very unique taste and this alone would bring me back  I also sampled the mushroom pan-fry their signature dish  This was absolutely great and I may order this when I come back againOverall a great restaurant in Old Town  Make sure to have reservations though.

61,1,"Let me be clear and direct in this review: I am a MAN and when I go to Chipotle I do not order a salad or a hand full of chips  I order a BURRITO with MEAT  I have eaten at over FOUR Chipotles which basically makes me an expert of Chipotle burritos and all food in generalOne of the greatest things about Chipotle is consistency you can walk into a Chipotle in anywhere in the world and you know that your food is going to be fresh and delicious  What you don't necessarily know though is the attitude  Is this a Chipotle where everyone is happy and burritos are being tossed joyously from one person to another in celebration of food preparation  Or is this Chipotle run by a dirty filthy man who hates you simply for being alive and will follow you out to your car and mug you  Nobody knows  Except me because I've eaten at this one several timesThis is a magnificent Chipotle  The people are good spirited helpfully construct your burrito quickly and pleasantly  Sometimes I go into this Chipotle and I'm like ""Eh not having such a great day - maybe a burrito will make me happy"" and do you know what  I go into this place and everybody is happy and working and it's like ""Yeah yeah now I'm feeling a little better  Maybe things aren't so bad  Maybe she still loves me""So to summarize this is a great Chipotle  It's bright friendly ample parking and the same fresh and delicious ingredients you expect."
1478,1,on vacation in scottsdale - and this place was incredible  it would stand up against the best restaurants in los angeles  the place is family style where everybody shares  you choose a few skewers and some main courses  can also get some sushi or some noodle appetizers  we got the miso cod and some sort of beef for the main courses and got a bunch of the skewers which were all incredible  the flavor of everything was just awesome  portions are tiny  i can't say enough about this place.
4824,0,I was not greeted until I was about to leave out of the store the lady ( said she was the owner ) at the register clearly saw me as I was looking at some tanks right by the register she said NOTHING until I was about to head out that's when she wanted to ask if I was looking for anything in particular  I actually wasn't I just wanted to see what they had to offer being that it was my first time in the boutique  I asked if she was the owner and she proudly stated that she is and that she has another location as well  Even if I would have received good customer service this definitely isn't a store that I'd be out on the prowl for the items seem a tad bit chintzy and out dated.
3085,0,After a couple more visits I deem this place the Walmart of sushi The past few times I have gone it takes FOREVER to get a seat Then it takes a bit to get your drink and its a bother to ask for a refill When you want your check - that takes FOREVER too You would think they would be on top of that and try to get people in and out faster The sushi is just okay and I now would rather spend a little more for great customer service and better quality sushi If you do decide to go take a peek at the floor surrounding the sushi making station Disgusting It looks like what you would find underneath a refrigerator.

4575,0,This was my first visit to this medical office  I made an appointment for vaccinesI was told to arrive 30 minutes early to fill out paperwork As I walked into the office the waiting room is very drab and dirty They had many papers taped on the doors and walls regarding cell phone use and other notices I signed in at the front desk The girl at the desk was not welcoming and never smiled I arrived 25 minutes early and had printed the forms off of their website and completed prior to the visit I was still given additional forms to fill out the front desk receptionist told me not all the forms are available on the website I politely mentioned someone should update the website I proceeded to fill out the forms The forms I completed from the website were the typical personal and medical history However the additional forms I was asked to complete were a bit strange The first was a form on varicose and spider veins (family history and symptoms I may be experiencing) the second was a prescription policy stating they will not call in or fax prescription requests to the pharmacy you must pick up the written request Lastly was a doctor-patient arbitration agreement I have NEVER had to fill out a form like this at any doctors office I have visited At this point I was questioning this medical practice and their doctors I found this to be unsettlingAfter waiting for 50 minutes in the waiting room I watched 3 people go into the back office before me and they arrived after me I was finally called back I walked through the door to the back office I was directed to a small corner to have my vitals checked This was not a closed space or room I was out in the open other patients and staff were walking past me After that I was escorted to a private room I will say that the  medical assistant was very friendly Then the doctor came into the room she never introduced herself Luckily I knew who I was seeing (Dr Finley) and she was very nice and answered all of my questions pertaining to the vaccinesI will not go back to this office and will not recommend it to my friends and family.

1390,1,Looks like we maaaade iiiiiiitto review 200Now that I've got a Barry Manilow song stuck in your head (you're welcome) it's time to show some love for Postino my favorite local place before I was a Phoenix localFirst things first-the staff here is ridiculously nice They are friendly helpful with the menu and attentive this is a glass half full place As in my glass is never less than half fullPostino has a simple but solid menu of appetizers soups and sandwiches along with a killer wine list that gets rotated out seasonally My first visit here a couple of years ago (the downtown location) involved the Nine Iron sandwich a sandwich that will fulfill your dreams of bacon and burrata on a delicious carby pillow of your choice of focaccia or ciabatta I don't know if the bread is made in house but it's fresh and the ciabatta doesn't cut the roof of your mouth like it usually does at lesser sandwich shops They use the same ciabatta for their brushcetta board which comes in fun combinations like proscuitto and figs salami and pesto and brie with apples You get a choice of four different kinds and honestly if you're dining solo this makes a good lunch (or dinner) Their roasted red pepper soup has a cult-like following and I now know why Think of the most delicious tomato soup you've ever had and multiply it by 100 It's a soup that I would eat in the dead heat of summer because it's one of those comfort foods that knows no season-it's just GOOD They offer happy hour from 11A-5P $5 glasses of wine bellinis and mimosas and I've yet to have a drink that has offended me Everything is reasonably priced including a $10 pick two option of soup salad and 1/2 sandwich which is usually what I do Postino is on my short list of go-to lunch places single girl dinner places and places to bring out of town friends Also probably a good date spotworking on investigating that.
352,1,I recently took my brother who was visiting from out of town to this place and we both absolutely loved it I tried the Sunbru beer which was nice and light with fruity tones to it My brother had the oatmeal stout which had a much bolder flavor with a malty oat undertone Both choices were great to start off our meals We also got the Bavarian pretzels and Four Peaks cheeseburger for our meals The pretzels were great since they were still warm and soft by the time they brought them over to our table It's sprinkled with bits of coarse salt but not overly done to the point where all you taste is the salt It was a perfect pairing with my beer I snuck a bite of the burger from my brother and that was really tasty but huge Sometimes you really do need a fork and knife to tackle on that burger Our food was definitely filling Overall I would highly recommend this restaurant to anyone visiting the Tempe area What really amazed me is the fact that they actually brew their own beers right in the restaurant Towards the back of the restaurant you can see all the giant tanks where they store the beer.

3939,0,"Quite disappointed with my experience hereI was looking for a specific item (a black/grey cell phone case which they had on their website) for a birthday gift for my girlfriend and because I work near by to Scottsdale Fashion Square I figured I would check there to save on shipping/be more convenient for meThey did not have the item in the store but offered to order it for me and I was told that it would take ""3-5 days"" to arrive to the store (which is where I asked for it to be sent due to the location of where I work)  Now I assumed that the 3 to 5 days were business days but seeing as I was ordering it on Saturday the 14th and didn't need it until Saturday the 21st I figured that at the worst it would be there on the Friday which I explained all of this to the saleswoman before making the transactionAfter receiving no call by Friday afternoon I put in a call to the store to ask what the status was and the saleswoman told me that it was scheduled to arrive the following Wednesday (the 25th)  Shocked I explained the time frame that I was given when I ordered the case and the saleswoman stated that the time frame should have been 5-7 business days (which as it turns out the 25th would still be 8 business days after it was ordered)  The saleswoman also tried to explain away the delay by saying that it may have been due to the holiday to which I thought to myself ""what holiday is in the middle of September"" and the saleswoman quickly followed the holiday explanation up with ""I mean its only a Jewish holiday but it may have caused a delay""  This definitely shocked me (only a Jewish holiday) but I proceeded to take the steps to see if my order could be taken care of in the time frame I was looking for  She looked at other stores in the Valley but it wasn't thereAfter hanging up with the sales woman I was looking at the receipt and noticed that the original saleswoman had ORDERED THE WRONG COLOR  Completely miffed at this point I called back to check if the color I had asked for originally was at any of the stores and again the answer was no and after discussing the incorrect order the saleswoman said that they could cancel the order and reorder in the correct color and have it one day shipped to the storeGiven the circumstance I understand that they did what they could but why wouldn't you have just one day shipped the original order That way when it was wrong I would have known in time to make other arrangements  Also the sales staff may want to work a little bit more on listening to what the customer is asking for/ordering and not saying insensitive things like ""only a Jewish holiday"" because it will certainly be a long time before I go to this location (if ever) again  Stick to online shopping or only buying what you can walk out of the store with when it comes to this store."
4934,0,"Came here with our family and there are only 5 of us Ordered pupusas and fried plantain It took a while before the food came out This place is a hole in a wall but we were willing to try it out because of the good reviews here We got our foodplantain was good The shrimp pupusas was my fave amongst beef and pork It was alrighthad better  We got the bill and noticed that they already included the gratuity Coming from Vegas I have no problem paying gratuity but for it to be included on the bill for 5 people  That's unheard of So I came up to the cashier to inquire about it one of the girl from the cashier pulled out the menu and said ""that's our rulesix people or more we have to include gratuity"" So I stood there a little confused until I came back to our table and my sis reminded me that there are only 5 of us So I went back and asked the cashier that there were only 5 of us so she shouldn't include the gratuity Then all of a sudden both girls that were in the cashier counter said that the rule was changed to 4 people Mind youthis is within 2-3 minutes time frame their rules changed from 6 people to 4 people When I asked why they did not mention earlier that it was changed from 6 to 5she kept on saying ""call the manager"" and was saying this rudely."
1221,0,"We ordered a couple pizzas tonight via their on-line system and were given an estimated delivery time of about 25 minutes  We thought this sounded quite short but were willing to give them a little leeway  After they missed the estimated delivery time by 45 minutes I called to see what the status of our pizza was  Alexa or Alexis (not sure which) answered the phone and as soon as she pulled up our order she started apologizing profusely she put me on hold and after a few minutes another person answered the phone with much more of a gruff voice didn't say anything except ""this is  (didn't catch name)  I figured the phone had been picked up by someone else so I told her I was talking to the other person  She told me she was the manager and that the driver said he tried to deliver the pizza and the woman that answered the door told him they already got their pizzaSince it's my wife and I that were home both expecting the pizza and both irritated that it hadn't arrived there is no way that happened at this house  I couldn't tell if the driver messed up terribly or if this was their cover story for messing up our order and not getting it outGrantedthey did offer to recook the pizzas and deliver them for free but at this point they are done in my book  The last thing I want is a pizza cooked and delivered by disgruntled people  This is the last time we will ever attempt to get a pizza from them and highly recommend you use caution when ordering."
3976,0,OK I read other reviews for Harbor freight and I've come to the conclusion that we don't care about quality anymore we want cheap That's what you get here CHEAP No Quality As I said I shop there too but I try to be careful what I buy there and not expect much For instance I bought a generator and paid $20 for a 2 yr warranty First one went bad after the 3rd or 4th use (about 2 months) I took it back and got generator number 2 That one never worked at all When I took that one back they informed me that the 2 yr warranty is good for one exchange and I would have to pay another $20 for a new 2 yr warranty (THAT'S NOT A WARRANTY) I managed to get the last one without paying the $20 (not sure how that worked out) The other option was to return for refund but there would be a 20% restocking feeWOWCHEAP CHINESE GARBAGEMostly.
2947,0,"I had been here a couple years ago and it was a pretty good experience but then I came here again recently for a Miranda Sings concert and I was very disappointed Can you say RIP OFF The tickets were reasonably priced ($20) but then there was a ""two drink minimum"" rule I wasn't thirsty do I opted for the cheapest option- I ordered a lemonade which was super nasty So I sent it back and ordered a sprite instead- also very nasty I don't know how they managed to make their simple fountain drinks taste so bad Anyway the next time I saw my waitress it was to bring me my check which was $13 I had only drank a couple sips of each of my drinks and that's what they charged So stupid- that's almost the price that I paid for my ticket itself Anyway Tempe improv should pull out of the food and beverage thing all together and just make stadium-style seating so that everybody can watch the performances a lot easier and not be ripped off and forced to buy gross drinks."
4306,0,I've never had a great experience at Macaroni Grill but decided to try it again since I heard their menu had changed  The menu may have changed but that's all that's changed  We sat for a good 1005 minutes before the manager came over to take our drink order saying our waitress was bogged down with other tables  I looked around and the bartenders were waiting on other tables  It looked like there were only 2 waitresses in the entire restaurantI ordered fettucine alfredo and was disappointed immediately when it arrived because they had ground up pepper sprinkled all over the top of it  Why would any restaurant put pepper all over someone's food  Well apparently they did it to disguise the fact that their alfredo sauce has absolutely no flavor  None at all  I have had alfredo pasta at fast food Italian places and it's been better than this  My husband ordered the chicken milanese and it was covered in some sweet sauce that did nothing for the chicken  The best part of the entire meal was the potatoes that were served with my husband's chicken  They were really good  Overall it was a complete waste of an hour of my life and $45  I will never go back againOh and PS  Who serves water in gross bottles with NO ICE  Yuck.
80,1,This is the very best (and inexpensive) Vietnamese food you can get in Phoenix I cannot convey how flavorful and wonderful and fresh the food is Don't know what you want No problem Just point randomly at the menu and order somethingService: A little on the slow side but the food is so good that I don't care That's a very high compliment from me because I'm NOT forgivingAmbiance: None This place is a dump and I don't care: This IS Phoenix so we're all trash anyway (Especially YOU Scottsdale snobs I KNOW who you are lol) The fluorescent lighting is lurid and harsh on the eyes No music playing It's a miracle that the sagging ceiling didn't fall upon our heads This restaurant is literally on its last legs Very much in need of a remodel and a makeover So put on your dirty soiled wife beater and your flip flops and you're set Da Vang is devine.
4987,0,"You can call this place Mulligan's or Maloney's or Baloney and Cheese but either way it blows as hard as the water spout of Moby Dick It could be the worst bar I have been to in Phoenix (and I've been to The Break Room) I don't know what this bar is trying to be a Pub a Dance club a Dive Talk about identity crisis Between the attendant in the small bathroom and scantily clad waitresses and the abysmal music this place is a cross section of all that is wrong with Scottsdale bars Let me explain:1  The bathroom is small do we really need a guy handing out paper towels I don't see the need for this at all in a place like Mulligan's 2 They play the worst combination of dance/ R&B and rap music People proceed to ""dance"" on the patio (which is no dance floor it's made of brick) and basically create fodder for the occasionally joke or innuendo to be thrown around by people like me I associated the dance floor with a train unloading cattle It seemed like steer were being brought down a ramp of train car and my friends and I were bidding on each one As the inebriated cattle walked by we were appalled by their excessiveness and complete disregard for themselves Stupid Cattle If I had a cattle prod this would have been an ideal time to zap them into early retirement for the evening  I would have been doing the entire town a favor 3 This place is dark and has a pub atmosphere but is trying to be a dance club Mulligan's suffers from the  $30000 millionaire syndrome as many young Scottsdalians do On the outside you may be wearing Hugo Boss but inside you are just a 27 year old Insurance Analyst I wouldn't set foot in the place again I am so defiant  the CIA would have to drug me and drag my hooded and shackled to this place I may even avoid the entire area this bar surrounds Like a Chernobyl this place has leaked radiation and everything around is contaminated Best line of the night from my friend ""This isn't a conducive environment""."
246,1,Ted's is a classic Tempe landmark I grew up ni Tempe and this place always brings back great memories The food is all made from scratch fresh each day The staff is always friendly Try the italian sausage and potato salad Ted's never disappointsGet there by 11 for an early lunch or after 1pm to avoid the massive lines.
3134,0,A sporadic text message from my friend had me wondering what to have for lunch Before I could figure it out he was already ready to go So I turned on the GPS on my phone and found a place nearby on Yelp I really hesitated to go here and was so close to insisting on Chipotle instead However I figured I would give NYPD another shotI rarely leave food unfinished even if its mediocre But the wings that came with the lunch special were so bad that I just could not finish them If there wasn't any hot sauce I probably would have vomited Did they decide to just take week old wings and serve them I am incredibly disappointed I seriously have never had wings as bad as NYPD's in my entire lifeThe pizza slice was ok but seriously why bother selling stuff that is just plain terrible I'm really going to hesitate coming back here In fact I probably wouldn't come here even if a friend invited me for lunch and paid for it One of my worst experiences ever.
3367,0,The evening started out nice but quickly turned bad when my boyfriend's food never showed up On  top of that the server was not attentive However they did take off my meal as well as his from the bill to compensate My food was really goodtoo bad the overall experience ruined the evening.
1577,1,Do makeup for a living and over time started to realize I was spending more time filling in my brows than anything else due to over waxing and plucking through out the years  Finally decided to grow them out not touching for the last 4 months  Hardest thing I have done other than quitting smoking  So here I am with overly grown out brows and lots of explanations to my clients as to why I look like Chewbacca  Very proud of my accomplishment and don't want just anyone to shape them and screw up all of this hard work  Found Laura on Yelp and figured with this many 5 star reviews she is the one and she was Great location clean and she listened and shaped them to my desire  I absolutely love them and finally feel human again  She is very reasonably priced and also includes tinting so I can afford to see her every 4-6 weeks I don't normally write reviews but she was so great I just had to get the word out.
374,1,I love it here Don't be intimidated by the line as it moves quickly It can be difficult to tell all of the flavor options are without getting in everyone else's way but the staff is very patient and you can sample anything I love the way the staff will bring out water and samples of their other drinks while you enjoy your gelato.
2787,1,"After trying several cheese steaks in the area we found no need to continue our search the perfect authentic ""wit whiz"" sandwich By far the best this side of the continent."
3378,0,Oddly enough it was a negative Yelp review that drew me to Diamond's in the first place (a review I see is no longer on Yelp) But after putting up with crappy service just to get the Sourdough burger I love the argument with a man who was either the GM or the owner about whether a service dog could come in his bar was the last straw I'm not sure why he thinks he can refuse service to someone coming in with a service dog but that was the last straw for me I will miss the Sourdough Burger but trust me when I suggest you find a nicer place and ask them to make a Sourdough burger (on sourdough bread with grilled onions and cheese).
3474,0,"I wanted to try this place and called Sunday night 8:45pm to see what time they closed  Some guy answers and says ""Uhhhhhhh Nine""  The long pause made me think he was looking at the clock and making up the closing time as he goes so I asked if that was their normal hours  He said no they close whenever it's slow  Uh ok lazy but at least honest  So I asked what time they'll be open till tomorrow  He said Mondays nine  The next day I called at 7:45pm to confirm business hours  Some guy (probably the same one) said they closed at 8pm  WTF  I said I called yesterday and was told they'll close at 9 today  He then goes ""Ohhhhhh  The restaurant IS closed at 9  But the KITCHEN closes at 8""  Are you kidding meI will never go to this Dillon's in my life because if they are that lazy irresponsible unprofessional and rude just answering the phone how are they at cooking or serving my food  Sadly if it's only the host doing this making up restaurant hours according to when his lazy ass wants to work then they need to fire him for pushing business away  I get it if some places open till 11 or 12 and if they close 1/2 hour early because the place is slow that's understandable  but to tell me the kitchen closes at 8pmWho ever owns / runs / manages this chain of Dillons needs to change their policies or this host."
1141,0,This has been my favorite place to eat for years but over the last few months it has gone completly downhill and after last night we will not be returningMy fiancé and I went wen with a friend and 3 young kids for an early dinner and asked for split checksFood was so so service was extremely slow and only checked on us once And when the bills came we were charged an automatic gratuity because of our party size eve if half were kids and it was separate tickets They also charged for things they never have before like guacamole and kids drinksThis loyal customer is done $65 for 2 adults and kids for dinner I don't think so.
4503,0,Sometimes you have to go to Walmart because they have everything and man do I hate coming here This has to be the worst Walmart I've been too It's always packed and always dirty I've gone on 3 different occasions and they were out of carts wtf Also they have a very dim lit parking lot and there are shady characters hanging out there at night near the gardening section Does this place have security or loss prevention because I've never seen them Avoid this place if possiblePros: It's Walmart it has everythingCons: Dirty crowded no security dark parking lots shady characters hanging out no carts.
1690,1,I was lucky enough to get two tickets to the opening night of Giselle What a beautiful performance The scenery was beautiful the dancers were great the story was easy to follow for those of us who don't have training overall it was amazing This production made me want to go to the ballet again and again Very professional and very entertaining.
2020,1,Top Notch I went here with a friend after a nice early evening of window shopping around the biltmore looking at things that I would either never buy because they are hideous or just way over priced but I must say the biltmore is so choice because it brings out the finest people and oh how I love to people watch So after a rough day of browsing Enter stage right the Cheesecake factory  I don't exactly remember what I got but I do remember sitting at the bar The beer was really really cold which is a huge plus for me the food whatever it was was delicious and the service was excellent I will say I had a great time because some how the next day I ended up with a cheesecake factory pint glass in my freezerand I know I didn't get this at the novelty station :) In any event I am giving this place 5 stars I would suggest going there if you can for good spirits good times and good food.
549,1,My favorite car wash A million times better than Danny's Fam Car Wash (which I hate btw)  They don't try to sell me a new windshield that I don't need they don't try to upsell on detailing or anything I can inquire myself They always do a great job and I have a huge SUV that is a pain to clean SUVs are a little more expensive to wash than cars (which I'm not disagreeing with it makes sense -- just an FYI) You can also get a yearly pass that is a huge discount to the one-off washes My entire family washes our cars here and will never go anywhere else.
2377,1,Great service and very good food  We had guacamole appetizer filet mignon cobb salad chicken quesadillas and crab cakes  All were delicious and reasonably priced  A great choice.
1122,1,Love this place  I hit it about once a month to avoid giving all my hard earned $$ to big shops like Bass Pro etc  There's plenty of high end gear and a pretty good selection of terminal and soft baits  The best thing about this shop is the old school vibe  There are usually a few older guys sitting up front (not employees) reading newspapers talking trash etc  Kind of a barber shop deal  Also if you want some help and an almost guaranteed laugh ask Jeep for help  The dude totally knows his fishing and he's got a wry sense of humor which he never fails to break out on me  Also when he's ringing up my items he nonchalantly knocks 1005% off of everything I'm buying which doesn't suck at all  Great local business great people totally legit  Can't believe there aren't more reviews on here  5 stars  Time to go fishing now.
4426,0,I'm just really disappointed I usually love it here but Basically I have family in town I brought some of them here last week and it was great Not today The butcher block was half the size from last week And missing items from it  We even had a pic to prove the size difference Just really annoying that the portions are not consistent.
3170,0,The food is always amazing but sadly customer service is totally lacking  We had the misfortune to have Marina M as our cashier today She was very rude and unpleasant  This was my husband first time so it took him a little longer to look at the menu and she gave us dirty looks and kept sighing along with rolling her eyes Is that really needed My husband just returned from deployment and I thought he would really enjoy something special and different but the employee made us feel as if we were wasting her time and that she had better things to do The food may be amazing but the lack in hospitality makes us never want to come back here again .
1822,1,I just bought a queen trust firm mattress from Justin at Mattress firm He was very helpful and knew a ton about the mattresses he was selling The mattress I ended up with is great and sleeping on it has been wonderful.
2880,1,When my grandmother passed away I inherited a lot of her old jewelry  I kept the pieces I wanted and wondered if I could sell the rest  Burland did a great job on my custom ring so I came back  The appraiser Mark sat with me for a good long time going through each piece  He helped me determine which pieces were worth getting officially appraised and which were not  I settled on getting appraisals for 4 specific rings  Another employee kindly sized the remainder of the rings which will help with resale  They were extremely helpful and knowledgeable  The appraisals were done in about a week - great description and photos  I know very little about jewelry so I always worry that I'm going to get fleeced  This family-owned business appreciates each and every customer  I will definitely return.
3272,0,So the boys were out for an afternoon of bike riding and drinking and my beau called me and wanted me to come join them at their last stop for a drink When I ordered a drink the waitress informs me that Chili's has a better beer (both on tap and in the bottle) selection than they do I settled for a jameson on the rocks It was getting later in the afternoon so I browsed their menu and found that Chili's has better pricing for the same pre-frozen-heated-in-a-fryer food I order some tots and another jameson to tide me over I was right the tots were frozen but the Arcadia Tavern had put regular pepper on them to make them fancy  As I was ending my second drink and eating some ice I got a very nasty surprise There was GLASS mixed in with my ice It cut open my mouth on two different spots and I left the bar with a bleeding mouth  All the manager offered us was free drink tickets That was really lame Bad customer service and poor beer selection and over priced food means we will not be going back.
2,1,I love coming to this bar Friendly bartenders and a beautiful view.
1247,1,To put it simply this place is amazing  I went in for the very first time today for happy hour after work  The front door was opened for me and I was promptly greeted and sat at a table with some co-workers  The waitress was very nice and efficient  The food oh wow that burger was fantastic and the double truffle fries were to die for We also shared some zucchini fries and sweet potato fries both were equally amazing  The prices were even excellent especially for the posh location I cannot wait to come back and eat again.
560,1,This place is so good The sicilian sandwiches are amazing The sesame bread is great Can't go wrong.
1947,1,NOCA stands for North Of CamelbAck i love this place went with a few friends  The foods are such a delight Chris the Chef actually trained years in San Francisoco before coming to the valley their duck is crips and sweet and to top it off their Scallopsomg it is sweet and delicious it melts in your mouth (not a taste of dry or fishyness)  Definitely a must  They also have a private dinning area for small parties  I would suggest calling for the menu before going because their menu changes daily it enables them to serve up the freshest dishes.
3861,0,"I stopped in on a Friday night because a friend of mine wanted to go here While this establishment is full of dating couples matchcom people and just out for a night I decide to order the Pizza Sauce Bloody Mary I have seen this made before and it is a beautiful beverage In the menu the description says house cucumber lime vodka or Chinaco Silver Estate Tequila ( which would be a Bloody Maria I think) salt and pepper rim Antipasti skewer and celery bitters We all know Bloody Mary's come with celery and olives I was served olives and a normal Bloody Mary mix as apparently Tanzy ran out of supplies The drink is not pretty like I have seen before and when I address the situation the bartender said ""we are out of everything we got slammed on Sunday"" Are you effin kidding me It's Friday You mean to tell me in five days time nobody could make it to a store or get a delivery My level of disappointment is shocking I dine in almost every restaurant in this area The Scottsdale Quarter is very trendy relatively expensive and has the ability to host so many people Having said that to give such a lame excuse for a patron bringing up a poorly made beverage is sad Being that Scottsdale insists on charging $1000 for a Bloody Mary I expect a sexy beverage that I have seen in the past Consistency is key in this industry When you wonder why Eddie V's is alive well  it's because they try very hard to have a great guest experience Good thing you guys have IPic money to support you."
252,0,My husband and I had a reservation @ 4:30 when they first opened  We were the first customers there  We ordered the spinach and artichoke dip to begin with that was very good along with a martini My husband ordered the rib eye steak and was informed it was marinated in some kind of a soy sauce and pineapple mixture  In a reasonable amount of time our food was delivered to our table with a baked potato  It was lacking butter but had a tbsp of sour cream chives and bacon bits  It was definitely not warm (actually cold) but my husband and I ate it anyways  Each entree comes with one side that is shown in the menu  It is basically a la carte no salad soup or  bread which I have no problem with when the main entree is good  Next came the rib eye which my husband said did not taste good at all  He did not care for the marinade but said even without it the qualify of the steak was lacking  He sent it back and ordered prime rib  I had also ordered the prime rib and it was small somewhat chewy and lacking in flavor  When my prime rib was brought out by a girl that was not our waiter she said oh did you want horseradish  I asked if it was creamed or raw to which she answered I do not know  I asked her to bring out the horseradish and a side of sour cream in case it was very hot  The so called horseradish had no horseradish in it and no flavor at all   This was a first   I ate about a 1/4 of it and decided that was enough  My husband's prime rib was brought out about 20 minutes later  a larger cut than mine although they just have one size and it was very red and extremely rare   He was never asked how he wanted his prime rib  He was informed then that he could have ordered the rib eye without the marinade but this was never offered to him by the waiter or mentioned in the menu as an option  He said it was just okay but was disappointed again   I must say the waiter never returned to our table once my husband returned his food  He avoided eye contact with us and did not return to ask how the food was if it tasted good or if we needed anything else at that time  At the end  he asked if we wanted dessert and brought us the bill  I am sure you can guess that we will not give this restaurant another try.
4846,0,Subway is better any day.
4203,0,First walking in I was hesitate  It looks really dirty and in poor condition  The service was horrible  We were seated and took about 20 minutes for someone to come and take our order  People who came in after us had their order taken before us When we arrived there was about five tables that still had dirty plates on them  When we left they were still there They had probably been like that for an hour  The food was good but the sides are portioned very poorly  I really don't recommend this place Go someone where else  The Service sucks.

3635,0,My boyfriend and I have always been fans of Arriba but they drove us away as customers We hadn't been back for a few months because of how bad our service had been but the food and drink was usually worth it Let me tell you that is now sub-par as well aside from the Margarita that was for 2 and fairly priced the waitress didn't card us and proceeded to call us Kid's/Kiddo's the remainder of our visit I work in the restaurant industry and would NEVER serve Kid's or Kiddo's a Margarita for two Also no waters were given to us until requested I ordered the Carne Asada and it came out looking good until I started actually eating it the carne was piled on top of a HUGE slab of red cabbage gross The waitress asked my boyfriend if he wanted Guacamole and Sour Cream making it sound like it was included in his meal so he said sure the bill came and $199 for sour cream and $250 for guacamole Holy hell they don't even give you more than 3 tablespoons of the stuff Concern for the customers wallet is not there and we just had her pay for it with her tip I don't think I've ever done that to anyone before I do not recommend this place to ANYONE unless you're just going for drinks and some chips and salsa other than that avoid this place entirely if you enjoy good service friendly atmosphere and good food.
4163,0,Its amazing how people are led to believe that this place serves delicious Mexican food I would like to know WHAT they are ordering Been there once and never went back again thanks to their awful long lingering wait staff that took forever to bring us drinks and food along with the low quality of the food The chicken enchiladas I ordered were disgusting to say the least chicken was black and gross and they were covered in a mountain of what seemmed to be green ooze that was trying to be salsa verde with nacho cheese Never been back.
459,1,You guys in Phoenix are blessed to have such a good Pho place as such good prices Nowhere else I have been on the west coast has this quality quanity and service for this amount of money CHEAP and GOOD is allways hard to find Lots of Vietnamese customers in the place so it must be good Anyone know of a better place in Seattle San fran or LA I hope they don't get a swelled head because of yelp and charge to much I eat like a pig and the big bowl is way to big Spring rolls $225 for two and a small bowl $475  HAHA amazing Also pages of vienamese food I havent even heard of.

4891,0,"This place is WAYYYY too full of itself and substandard to receive anything more than a single star rating First off their ID checkers have the arrogance and attitude of New York club bouncers - Hey fellas don't flatter yourselves it's a crappy dive bar (just because you get some low-end Scottsdale yuppies as regulars doesn't mean you're big time K) Thought they were bouncing at Studio 54 or somethingNext up the last two times I lowered my standards and entered this place I GOT NO SERVICE AT ALL I stood/sat up at the inside bar for a full 5 mins once and like a minute the next time and said ""Fuck this place I'm never coming back here"" Then when I went to leave I had to go through a phalanx of overly self-important security goons and basically told them off It's kind of a shame too because this place is like a 10 min walk from my house No on second thought it's no shame at all For me The shame is on them Whatever."
4081,0,Best Margarita  Whoa this place has a reputation that it does not deserve  Food is ordinary and inexpensive but the margaritas are overpriced and make no sense when the beer is so much cheaper here  Young stuck up Millennial 20 somethings hang out here and it is almost as if this place got transplanted off Mill Ave into Scottsdale or maybe it's just the Scottsdale ASU kids that go here because they live close by in Scottsdale with mommy and daddyCan be loud with limited seating and parking is a pain here as well.
1838,1,Nice staff.

231,1,Holy waffle sundae Love this place The wait as with every place in Scottsdale sucks But the food and service were outstanding The waffle sundae was excellent as was the chicken wrap.
4414,0,"Still a place that is unacceptable in my book--especially when a server there goes out of their way to message me privately on Yelp to complain about my punctuation and signing off--every so ""sincerely"" i might add with: "" love the B*tchy waitress from AZ88Way to keep it classy over there."
957,0,They make nice stuff but it's not amazing They have a lot of hidden costs such as $7 because you didn't buy the shirt there They claim are a set up fee but things are all done on the computer$7 to type When it's all said and done you have paid for $2 of work and $14 of fees I'll gladly take my business elsewhere.
1238,1,I work for the same company as the first reviewer and this week it was my department's turn to volunteering at St Mary's This was actually my third time volunteering for the organization as it is an annual event for my team In prior years I haven't been into volunteering because I was basically an ass and didn't see the benefit in it for me Personally the past six months have seen some really good highs as well as some very bad lows but I met people who helped change my perspective on helping people and giving back to the community  And even though it should be a year-round thought and not only be about this time of year the need is more visible during the holidays Knowing that people are struggling and seeing the good this organization does for people really does make a difference With my family back East and just me here in Arizona I don't participate in the holidays but spending time volunteering or supporting local charities is a great way to give to those who are in need and I have discovered the good feeling it bringsThe first reviewer provided good quantitative data on the number of hungry children and adults living in the country today With 3 grandparents still living I am sensitive to the needs of our seniors and the struggles they face with heating bills and medication taking money away from food expenditures Another thing that impressed me with St Mary's is that it was the country's first food bank founded back in 1967A difference this year in comparison to my first experience with St Mary's is the impact the economic downturn has had on families Due to increased unemployment cutbacks in jobs rising bills and other concerns many more people are facing hunger this year than ever before That puts extra pressure on organizations such as St Mary's to meet the demand and that is accomplished in part to volunteers such as you and me We were told that last year they served more than 65 million pounds of food - enough for 300000 meals per day - do Arizonans alone With unemployment continuing to increase that number is sure to be higher this year The volunteer staff member told us that the emergency bags they assemble which is for people who just lost a job or are in immediate need and not yet in the system have seen an increase of 400% this yearMy group today totaled about 60 people and we filled boxes for 2 hours When you volunteer the cool thing is the volunteer staff member will total how much food the group assembled and how many people it helped With our work today she said we bagged 6800 lbs of potatoes 2230 of the emergency food bags (which she said would be gone by this evening) and 15200 lbs of prepared food boxes (550 boxes on 22 palettes) All total for the day the grand total with prepared boxes and food bags she said would be enough to feed 35200 people Granted we had a big group but for just 2 hours of help that is a big difference The sad thing is with the number of people coming in for assistance that food will be gone in a couple of daysI would encourage everyone to take some time out of the schedule and help out A little bit does go a long way and those recipients greatly appreciate what they receive.
2503,1,Service with a SMILE Warm and inviting and the food was ok for finger foods if you're not interested in having a large meal and just want to pick  What topped the icing on the cake was that the Manager would come by your table and ask if everything was to your likingnow THAT deserves 5 stars in my book.
2462,1,This was the first place my fiancee and I looked for rings The staff was very knowledgeable and educated us on the different diamond types cut and clarity They took the time to show us what they had in stock and were very friendly and professional We did pick out a diamond and a setting that day They held it for us until we made our final decision There was absolutely no pressure to buy In fact they understood that we wanted to look at other places before making that final commitment After looking at a few more places and not getting as good a service as we did at Burland we decided to go with the first one that we had picked out They made the experience of looking for the prefect ring so pleasant We were so impressed by them that we will probably be getting our wedding bands here as well.
321,1,In fitting fashion for the Glam frequenter i didn't take the time to actually read any of the other reviews  They're probably not as good as this one anyway  So i'm going to skip them  Yes  I'm going to do that  Maybe I'll read them later when i wake up around 3pm which will be an hour earlier than my usual timeOh yeah Glam rocks the block  Or it used to  I don't really know  I've moved on  But at one point it was my church and Faux Show DJs/Devon on the bar were my holy trinity  But that was a long time ago and as I've already said it probably sucks now  If this place was any LESS pretentious it would be a Scottsdale Ultra-lounge but since i forced myself into 'The Scene' one time a long time ago it wasn't I who was looked down upon  Fortunately  Because God be damned i had a kickass time here  You know a long time ago   But yes their drinks are strong and prices cheap and Devon is a twink who can make a drink  Plus they play lots of CSS LCD Soundsystem Datarock Los Campesinos and Mickey Avalon which is nice  Sigh  I miss this place  Or I don't.
115,0,While I have never dined at this restaurant I am giving this a 1 star for my experience with them over the phone I was trying to order a bottle of sake for my friend who is celebrating her birthday there this evening because I am out of state The hostess was very helpful and went to find the manager The manager told her they could not do it How do you take reservations for your karaoke rooms Over the phone credit cards Basically a lazy manager who did not want to help make a night more special for my friend I have worked in the restaurant industry for 8 years and that is not hospitality So though I live in LA the next time I visit Phoenix this will not be a place I will be stopping by Great job.
446,1,Great unassuming business well worth seeking out  The proprietor used to run the famous Pyramid Brewery and he's put that fruity beer expertise to good use with his yummy watermelon wheatI'd go here again absolutely.
275,1,I love everything about this place The atmosphere is so inviting and I'm always a sucker for any twinkle lights and candles The patio is beautiful and plan on making my way there once it cools down I've been to this location twice and the food has always been outstanding Some of the BEST spinach dip ever and this place has one of my top 5 burgers The shoestring fries that accompany it are delicious Last trip we splurged after I read about the hot fudge sundae OMG I'm still thinking about it Great place for date night Excellent service Great food Can think of zero negatives Wellmaybe that I can't afford to go every night.
2139,1,A bar with one of the best views around that serves up amazing cocktails as well If I lived in PHX I'd be taking all my dates here Gorgeous cozy romantic LOVE ITThe bartenders are all very friendly and they are fantastic mixologists I absolutely loved my Bourbon Sidecar And you can get a little piece of SF here - yes they have FernetLocated at Sanctuary Resort you can enjoy drinks inside the swanky lounge or even better - take your cocktails outside onto the secluded patio get comfy by the fire pit or under a heat lamp and star gazeSWOON.
655,1,Definitely one of our favorite good eats in town The magical cinnamon and sugar dusted sweet potato FEZ fries with their special dipping sauce is extremely addictive When we go with a group we always ask for extra dipping sauce so it is enough to share among everyone One basket is enough to share among three-four peopleFEZ kisra is very flavorful Lots of fresh and flavorful topping one of my hubby's favorite on the menu FEZ burger is a good one when you want a safe option to try out their food if you are a little less adventurous The field salad that comes with it is fresh and tasty too My favorite dish is the Crisp Pomegranate Chicken The sweet flavor of pomegranate dressing and the tender chicken breasts are beautifully complimented by the veggie and fruits that are placed below the chicken A surprise item was the breakfast kisra It was actually surprisingly good even my father in-law did not mind it He has always been a simple cheeseburger kind of guy but has really enjoyed all the food he had tried hereWe yet to try their desserts mainly because by the time we are done with the fries and the main course there was no more room seriously their portion is well worth the moneyThe only one thing I did not really care for was the FEZ lettuce wraps It was cold and a little too sweet and fruity for me But again I don't really like overly sweet foodI don't drink alcohol but a few times my hubby and friends tried a few of their signature drinks and really really loved them The list of a few favs: honeydew melon key lime pie apricosmo and pomtini I did enjoy the virgin mojito here FEZ is one of the few places I can actually order thatSeriously take yourself out there now and give it a try Treat yourself with a basket of cinnamon and sugar dusted sweet potato FEZ fries and try out one of their dishes your taste buds will thank you for itAlso I rate their services to be outstanding compared to most of the restaurants at this price range.
898,1,I have been eating at Crackers for years and I can honestly say I have NEVER had a bad meal  Their food is so friggin good that i'm craving it right now as I type  From breakfast (sirloin or california eggs benedict are my two faves) to lunch (any salad or soup is great and of course the best sandwich ever - Roast Beef Avocado Melt) to dessert (world famous Bread Pudding and the ever so chocolaty Kahlua Brownie) you cant go wrong great atmosphere  Always packed  great service.
3021,1,I have been under chiropractic care since 1996 and never have I experienced better results than with Dr Natalie  She has a fantastic personality and takes the time to hear my concerns  I especially like Dr Natalie's holistic approach at the start of each session she verbally checks in to see how your body responded to her last adjustment taking digital notes to track your progress  During the adjustment Dr Natalie attends to your comfort/pain levels while sensing areas of tension in your skeletal/muscular structure  She makes adjustments through a combination of manual manipulations and activation  The phenomenal pre- or post-therapy offered by Dr Natalie's team of massage therapists compliments her fine workI have personally referred three other patients to Dr Natalie in the past four weeks and each of them echoes my sentiments  Whether this is your first or your umpteenth visit to a chiropractor I STRONGLY recommend Dr Natalie.
1391,0,First time and I wasn't impressed Chicken is flavorless dry and way too pricey Will not return.
1400,1,Really like the staff here they really go out of their way to help you with everything They have long lines and they are very busy But they seem to go through everyone really quickly and still have a smile and good information The lobby is always open as well which also makes it good because you can get most of what you need Including this time of year some boxes.
4577,0,Ate there last night Had a big hair in my food Kinda grossed me out so I only ate half What I tasted was good.
2725,1,This is my favorite bar in North Phoenix There are tons of TVs perfect for football season if you want to watch multiple games There is an OTB not really my thing but pretty cool anyhow There are pool tables and dart boards and a little claw machineThe restaurant is very open There are places to sit at tables or booths a bar off to the left and nice seating on the patio The best part though the food I frickin love their food So many great things to choose from and they have a large menu selection Some of my favorites are the pulled pork sandwich nachos (they make their own cheese sauce) and the burgers My absolute favorite is the bacon cheese fries (sub seasoned waffle fries for regular) You are in a serious carb coma after eating them but whatevs they are too good to even care The staff is always consistently friendly and on point I really do love it here and am super happy it's so close to home.
2923,0,"My girlfriend does not eat gluten so we decided to try Indulge for lunch as they had a very extensive gluten free menu I had every intention on buying a carnivore burger however decided to try a veggie burger instead If the name of the restaurant has ""BURGER"" in it I am assuming a burger of the veggie variety would be fine as well I even asked the server if it was a good veggie burger or if I should order something else she said ""We have VERY good veggie burgers"" Cough riiiiight  Our server was very prompt and friendly and suggested if we were going to order fries off the gluten free menu we should do so early as they take longer to prepare so we ordered them in advance(baked not fried)  She came back to take our actual order and not 3 minutes later brought out the fries before the burgers Ok a bit early fine by me The fries were soft in many places and burnt in others I thought there were ""MEH"" my girlfriend thought they were gross A little while later my veggie burger was served - a shriveled up cow-pie slapped between two buns with leaf of lettuce and onion perched on top A pickle and some carrot shreds garnished the plate The server saw my confused expression and said ""Oh we don't put anything on the veggie burger but if you want some ketchup or mustard"" Seriously No aioli No spread No hummus or anything to damped down this dried up patty of cardboard  I ate half of it primarily because it kept falling apart (nothing was used as a binder apparently) I had to eat it with a fork but a spoon would have been better It was so bad I would have prefered one of those frozen Bocca or Morning Star veggie patties For $9 it was such a joke My girlfriend's gluten free burger was a $12 burger on a salad She asked for guacamole and asked if she should write it on the ""build your own burger"" menu pad they give you The server said ""nope I will remember"" Guess who forgot the guac Her burger looked lackluster and somehow a dill pickle on a salad seemed wrong Frankly I'd rather Indulge elsewhere."
467,1,When the Gelato is actually made and served by a real Italian it just tastes better  This stuff is the real deal I would say that when I go there I feel that I'm transported to Venice and that I'm eating the Gelato in the home country but that would be an exaggeration  It's still darn good even though I'm stuck in Scottsdale  Ciao.
4453,0,"I really liked the food here at first I also love that they deliver serve espresso drinks and have a relatively friendly staff Actually a GREAT staff with wonderful customer service and the genuine attitude of a local business that cares about their customers However it is hit or miss because they seem to have a girl answering phones and taking orders who is a COMPLETE IDIOT Not only is she an idiot but she lacks any sense of customer service and has a very bitchy ""what do you want"" kind of attitude with people To call her mentally challenged would be an insult to the mentally challenged seeing as I have dined there twice and seem to know a great deal more about the restaurant and the services they provide than this bimbo I took two stars off JUST for her and if she is working or answering the phone when I come in I will take my business elsewhere***Edit: After I received a friendly message from the owner apologizing and offering a free meal (which I have yet to accept and probably never will) I returned because I liked the food so much and wanted to share the fun environment with a guest Both of the girls working treated me heinously from the instant we approached the counter Perhaps they had seen this review and recognized me or perhaps they just have impossibly terrible manners and attitudes Either way they do not seem like friendly people who understand that customers are supposedly to be treated with respect Although the owner seems to be a wonderfully dedicated and kind person I cannot give anything higher than 1-star after the way I have been treated I am not a very resilient person I am emotionally sensitive My feelings were hurt to be treated that way especially after the several crappy experiences that I had prior To be perfectly clear even though I did not feel good about the way I was treated I never went out of my way to make those girls feel bad about how poorly they were behaving while they were being paid to do so and I truly feel that their actions are entirely unjustified Ideally they would also be held responsible as unlikely as this is Also please note that most of the negative reviews about the staff have been flagged meaning someone who works there is fully aware of the problem and refuses to do a single thing about it Just wow."
4421,0,New ownershipBig time mehThis place is counter service  I ordered a LARGE chicken dynamite/dynamic (don't remember the specific name) fried rice with $2 drink and egg roll combo$1162 total  OK kinda stiff  Let's see if the food justifies the costNOPEPortion was small  There was get this the smallest portion of rice that I've ever seen in a fried rice order  I couldn't believe itAnyways I will not be going back  Thai Elephant I never should have betrayed you.
823,0,Good brownies but horrendous customer serviceI placed 6 different orders online for Christmas presents They messed up 2 of them and then proceeded to insinuate I was a liar (customer service rep basically told me that over the phone) (Mistake 1) Ordered Winter sprite wonderland (package of sprites) - cost on website $3495 They sent a winter wonderland package - cost on website $2995 They didn't send me any sort of notification that they ran out of my item or that they would be sending an alternate item Usually when you do this you send an item of GREATER not LESSER value I emailed on a Wednesday about the mixup no response until I sent a followup email on Saturday Customer Service rep said that they did respond but couldn't prove it - she just got argumentative on the phone Basically she said that they have every right to send a replacement item even if it is of lower value and that this is posted on their website I couldn't find the notice on their website - but who sends a lower value item and then doesn't credit the difference They said I have to buy something else and they will credit the $4 difference to me on my next order NO apologies for the error just a stubborn attitude from Jennifer - the customer service rep No thanks Won't be buying from them ever againShe then couldn't assure me that the gifts I sent to others in my other orders were actually the correct gifts  I have my doubts based on them messing up 2 of my orders so will stay away from using them for gift orders ever again(Mistake 2) Had to change the shipping address on a order They did change the shipping address on that order correctly however they also mistakenly changed the address on another order (the order 
4931,0,Very cheesey especially for knowledgeable adults  I find it hard to believe that savvy young people would find it very interesting as the displays are dated and technologically out of date  Our space program's history deserves much better.
4282,0,Do not stay here upon walking in to what they call suites you smell dust and this awful musty smell to find very dated layout and kitchen Initially thought it was just me but automatically felt itchy and the room just didn't feel comfortable and clean I even hesitated to walk barefoot in the room because I felt the carpet was dirty and musty The air conditioning is horrible super noisy and super cold - don't even bother What really did it for me was the fact that I found a bug in my sheets something that looked like either bed bug or termite Immediately called front desk packed my things and checked out I was literally in the room for just a couple hoursdon't know how I stayed so long to begin with.
685,1,Yummy vegan treats Not the most healthy but tasty and meat free.
2721,1,I read the reviews and tried the pulled pork and chicken with the hot n sweet bbq sauce and was impressed I usually don't go to bbq joints because I leave feeling I could have had better at home  Customer service was good too Plus beer was $2 Ill definitely come back.
4585,0,Sicilian-Style Pizza was a complete joke  Adding $5 to the price of a regular crust pizza for the worst cardboard bread ever  Too bad it was a take-out order and I live more than 10 miles away from this joint  It would have been sent back if the first bite of cardboard occurred in-houseWings = decent  Basically a 15 if there were half stars.
3421,0,"I took my BMW here because the dealership I purchased it from (used) took it here to have an oil leak repaired  First off the oil leak was ""repaired"" only to find out later that it really wasn't  Turns out there was a slit (cut) in the valve cover gasket which either occurred when this shop put the part in or they purchased it with the defect but either way the problem was missed on their part which tells me they do not pay attention to detail  So when we noticed the leak was still an issue it was under warranty through this shop for the original work so I took it back  I spent a few hours waiting since I live in the far east valley they did repair it however later that day my ""service engine"" light came on then went off  A few days later I parked my car turned it off and went to start it again after picking up my mail and the car would not start  Thankfully my husband is a mechanic (the only reason he did not fix the oil leak the 2nd time around was because it was under warranty) we towed my vehicle back to my house which was only down the road but it was dead  Come to find out the cam positioning sensor had not been plugged back into the vehicle all the way which is what tripped my ""service engine"" light a couple of days before and once it became looser over the course of driving the vehicle the vehicle finally wouldn't start  My husband plugged this in completely (like it should have been doen at the shop after fixing the oil leak) and there have been zero issues sinceNow I'm not sure if this shop did this on purpose or if they just do not pay attention to detail very well  But given that something as simple as an oil leak required TWO visits due to a part that they either didn't notice was defective or they messed up themselves and then they did not finish putting the vehicle back together when they were finished I am not very happy  On top of it I had to have my vehicle towed (thank goodness for towing on my insurance) and had to deal with a dead vehicle when my school aged son and I were both sick at the timeI would NEVER recommend this shop to anyone I will never ever go back and I also intend on notifying the dealership I purchased my vehicle from of the issues in the hopes that they choose another BMW shop in the future to service any used BMW's that come onto their lot  What a complete and utter nightmare."
3690,0,Can you say Dog Poop in your mouth Cuz that's what you'll be thinking when your eating at this place All these people hyped it up and compared this place to the Oh so delicious IN N OUT Which is the best fast food burger on the planet This place seriously gave me a stomach ache.
770,1,They've been always so great with the kids on a tour Loved coming back year after year.
1407,1,I love the Yard House  (I used to live in LA & the Yard House located on the pier in Long Beach is my absolute favorite place to lounge with friends)  The Yard House @ Westgate also has great ambiance  The bar is always a fun place to sit and outdoor seating is enjoyable especially when the weather is nice  Outdoors you can choose to sit in comfy patio chairs with cocktail tables or at regular tables that allow you a view of the center fountainsService--I've always had great service from the staff even on a crowded night  They always seem friendly and fun  They do their best to accommodate and make decent recommendations when you're not sure what to orderFood--The spinach dip is wonderful as an appetizer  I usually order the thai chicken or walnut pear salad which I always get with the dressing on the side in case I don't finish I tried the roasted turkey pot pie once which is HUGE and could feed 2 easily  It held up well and wasn't half bad reheatedBeer is ALWAYS good  I've never had a beer there that I didn't like and a while ago you used to be able to buy a whole 'yarder' where they served you a beer in a yard long glass  My out of town guests loved ordering the 'yarder' b/c it was a unique experience  Cost--I do have to agree with some of the other posters--the prices could be better but I enjoy it there so much that's just the trade off.
3019,0,If I could give this place 0 stars I would Want there on Veterans Day for my fathers birthday There was a group of about 15 of us in the bar Only 4 tables in the dinning room with 3 servers and a manager It took us 20 minutes to even get a drink order for me my mother my boyfriend and 20 month old son At that point she was already trying to get a food order from us are you kidding me Got our order in and being a waitress I always ask tables with Kids if they want the kid food to come out first Not only did she not ask his come out lastMom got the brisket I don't know why they even bothered to bring it out You could see the fat just sitting on top Got the salmon which was ok but it was supposed to come with two sides but only got one When I asked about it they aid they would get it Maybe 5 minutes later got my Mac and cheese side Lukewarm at best and the cheese on top wasn't even melted My boyfriend never got one refill on his soda even when he put it to the end of the table Needless to say it was a HORRIBLE experience and I will never be going back.
4900,0,"Have had my oil changed here before It's fine But today they decided that they wouldn't accept company checks This with advertisements on their marquee and on a banner in their shop that the offer ""fleet services"" I am the owner of a construction company and I do not give my employees company credit cards I don't know of other businesses that have a ""fleet"" of vehicles that give their employees cards Makes no sense So I drove to a different jiffy lube location which accepted my company check  which makes no sense either but I got my oil changed so that's something."
1860,1,After years of spending hundreds of dollars a week in dry cleaning I discovered Montecarlo Cleaners about 5 years ago  I love this place  I was a little hesitant at the beginning I couldn't believe they were charging only 199 per piece no matter what piece  I gave it a try and I was impressed  In five years I  have only had one incident with a piece being damaged however the owner himself Frank gave me a call and paid for my husband's shirt  They raised the price to 225 a piece now but it is still an awesome deal compare to other places  I don't understand why you have to charge almost $10 for a dress to be dry cleaned  I will gladly recommend this place to anyone.

2394,1,Do you like trendy shit-music and half dressed plastic surgery queens gyrating all around you while you pay twelve dollars for your appletini If your answer is yes don't bother coming here Dive bars are plentiful in Phoenix but the Bikini is in my 'hood It's a dirty unassuming place with a couple of no-nonsense bartenders and a good jukebox There are a couple of rules to follow when visiting the Bikini: 1 Bring cash Cards aren't accepted the atm machine is there for decoration only as it hasn't worked in at least two years 2 Don't make fun of the guy in the overalls and farmer hat He's my neighbor 3 Don't piss off the bartenders Tip them well treat them nicely and don't order more than three dirty martinis If you are nice to them they will be nice to you This includes but is not limited to: the strength of your drinks the price of your drinks and whether or not you get a drink at all They take no shit If you can't handle it stay away The place gets crowded enough as it is.

3040,0,First and last time ordering from this dump I live nearby and thought I'd give the place a try and get a carry out order Ordered the Egg rolls 4 per order just ok nothing to write home about Also Ordered the Chicken fried rice and 3 different entrees of chicken The Teriyaki Lemon Grass and Garlic and pepper I actually had to look at the Lids of each carry out order to see what I was eating because they all looked and tasted the same None of them came stir fried with any vegetables just plain strips of dried chicken in their so-called sauce Absolutely Horrible and bland Im not sure what the other reviewers were eating but don't believe them.
2473,1,Every year in the dead heat of summer I retreat to Hilton Squaw Peak and my first stop (after the lazy river of course) is Aunt Chilada's Oh the atmosphere the history of the restaurant the food and the friendly faces make me feel at home every time I am here Whether it is sitting outside at the outdoor bar or seeking refuge in the air conditioning it is simply the best part of my trip All I have to do is follow the painted chili peppers from Hilton ( I actually use them to get home if too much patron was consumed just kidding I call the Hilton to have the golf cart pick us up Duh No really that is available for hotel guests) The fish tacos are the best I have ever had and I am a snob from California  The salsa is southwest style and really good Very good beans and rice and free buffets daily at happy hour Who can complain Bands on Fridays are fun too Overall this is a gem in the desert Always featured on Fox TV  and was also spotlighted on Drinking Made Easy If you haven't been then you are missing out Live Love Eat at Aunt Chilada's.
996,1,I'm giving this place 5 stars on the quality of the sushi  I came here for lunch when on business and saw all the good ratings here so decided to give it a try  First off is don't come on Monday for lunch they are closed  Second be prepared to wait a bit for your order and items to come  I'm ok with that to a point  because I think they really spend the time to prepare everything so it comes out nice  But the woman working there seems not  to know many answers to the questions I had She really could not answer which fish are in which selection  She kept leaving and coming back to give me answers but between that and handling all the other tables it got to be a long wait to get everything  So on to my sushi order When I first got my order I was a little surprised of the selection I got it was mostly different types of tuna  I had red tuna white tuna albacore (a tuna) yellowtail spicy tuna rolls and 1 salmon sushi and a california fake crab like sushi and a shrimp sushi (Ebi)  All the fish tasted really good though the white tuna melted in my mouth The spicy tuna is made a little different than at most places  They chop it in pieces and and kind of float it over rice rolls Very good but would have liked a little more spice The sushi chef was very nice but seemed a little serious at the same time  He would keep asking if everything was ok and I just kept saying everything was fine as I tried to sneak in a picture of my dish I don't know why but somehow It felt like I was committing an illegal act  Anyway 5 stars for the great food and 4 stars for the the little things that I think that could improve.

4295,0,"We ate at Chompie's in Scottsdale last night Table of four It may have been the worst dining experience of my life The food came to the table an hour after it was ordered and only after we appealed to the manager Of course the orders were wrong and ice cold The check was wrong the first time and all four times that it was redone I was only going to pay what I thought I owed anyway but then the manager tore up the check and said the meal was on him The food Tasteless pastrami that was 50% fat The corned beef was higher quality But in a blind taste test I would have guessed Irish pub not ""NY kosher style deli"" This is ""New York Deli"" God forbid."

66,1,Love the hungry monk They have a great beer selection and  I love all their food And I love places that do daily specials We always sit at the bar and tiffany martese and heather are all super nice and make sure to take care of us There's one older guy that bar tends who is pretty rude so if we see he's working we just go somewhere else So maybe I'd give the place four and a half stars because of him But overall we love it.
1611,1,After hearing all the hype about bareMinerals makeup I finally went to go nose around and see what the deal was I stopped in to the little shop in Fashion Square drawn in by all of the pretty makeup and soft lighting of the shop (marketing at it's finest folks) and ended up getting my makeup done WOW You really don't understand what a difference it makes until you look at your face before and aftercrazyKai was the girl doing my makeup sweet girl who was really good at explaining everything about the makeup as she fixed my face And as she did it she explained the techniques so I could duplicate the look at homeNow granted I will never reveal to my husband how much money I spent on this new face of mineBut I will tell you that it is worth every penny The very next day my clients were shocked by how much different I looked Those compliments were enough to erase the dent in my wallet.
4458,0,This review is to all parents Papago Park is going to crap What happened to Papago over the past few months Maybe since it is summer the city's staff isn't taking as good of care of the grounds as they should but there was dangerous broken playground equipment all kinds of trash in the sand and the general upkeep of the playground was horrible BTW: I just have to say Papago park gave me the creeps today It was completely empty other than a few shady guys in the parking lot that I am pretty sure were doing a drug deal I wont be going to Papago Park again I like to hike there (just N of McDowell) but I don't feel this park is a safe place for my kids to go and play anymore.
4554,0,"As far as gluten-free eating this airport is TERRIBLE  We were ""trapped"" in this airport for over 10 hours and searched it from end to end  The best that I could do (to prevent starvation) was to attempt to eat at the Fox Sports Lounge  The waitress had no idea what gluten was and I would most certianly not have eaten there if I didn't feel as though I had no other choice  I ended up with a chicken breast (about 2"" by 2"" in size) with two onion slices and two pepper slices and 13 pickles on the side (charged full price though)  WOW  I was feeling healthy after that ""meal""  Boo to this airport and its eating choices Boo."
4386,0,First things first no waiter was to be found about ten minutes later they gave us our water and left again It wasn't even busy There were only TWO dim sum carts floating around somewhere Then our waiter finally came around and took our orders of lunch entrees The food was not even that good as the reviews that are posted on here When we came up to pay the bill was super overpriced I will not be returning here I am better off eating at Great Wall Cuisine.
1217,1,Small lite cafe in a strip mall put the decor aside and go in and enjoy the wonderful food and generous portions  Eggs Benedict is the house specialty  Good old school breakfast that also is open for lunch.
2227,0,they suck.
3524,0,The customer service here is beyond ridiculous Late check in because staff is on their own agenda and rooms were not clean in time (I waited 2 hrs dyer I was supposed to be able to have access to my room) the mgr on the floor Leesa laughed me when I registered a complaint a out the cleanliness of the room the security in rooms is poor (drunk guests entered my room through my patio) the service at the restaurant is slow and no one seems to care about the guests or their stay I figured the only thing I can do is write a yelp review because there is no one else that will do anything.
2299,1,Very nice restaurantGood food and good service The kebab was wonderfulThank you guys.
369,1,I love that there are restaurants pushing healthy food I love that this restaurant has an endless menu of vegetarian options which is an odd (in a good way) feeling while trying to decide what to order when eating out I'll admit that the food could use more flavor in the way of more herbs and spices but overall I really like this place and will come back The atmosphere is great and service is attentive I had:- Herb hummus: Regular hummus dressed up with greek crudites (olives cucumber tomato feta etc) served with yummy soft pita bread This is a great app to share- Meditterean Salad: Like two meals in one It was mostly quinoa and my only complaint is that it should come with with more lettuce/arugula or be relabeled as a Quinoa Salad There were tons of yummy feta and marcona almonds which with the quinoa made a very filling meal- Strawberry seasonal soda: Yum - fruity and spritzer and so refreshing Kind of pricey at $4 with no refill but so perfect for a warm summer day.
1514,1,Great Pub  Good food cold beerreally enjoyed itgreat selection of beers on tap.
1844,1,The short: Pricey eclectic Japanese food Wish I lived in town I'd come backThe long: This place is located in heritage square and is set up in an old house Despite this the inside is very clean and they make the small space work The seating is cozy and intimate without being cramped The second thing you notice waiting for you table is the crazy imported Japanese beer offerings in the drink menu Personally I'm a beer snob and tried as many beers as possible They have a sweet potato lager and an oyster stoutWe came with enough people to try most items on the menu When I was there they had sticky rice with pork belly sashimi ceviche goat cheese cheesecake  It was all really goodThis place is really hipster/trendy I'm thinking the background music was Pandora with a Cold War Kids seedThe only real negative is the price But everything is spectacular The service is great they're all friendly they know the menu in and out The food is delivered right on time The food is great varied and will definitely surprise you They even throw in a trick candle if its someone's birthdayI normally grade pretty hard This is the first place I've given a 5.
1925,1,Ahhh gelatowhat would the world be like without it I don't want to know It's amazing stuff and this establishment has a great selection of flavors They offer sample tastings and although I could easily try all of them I figured two was socially acceptable  The decor has a euro-retro feel and there always seems to be somewhere to sit which is nice We've never ordered the Italian coffee although it smells delicious as well A great treat anytime.
1885,1,My sister dragged me here with the kids but to mu surprise everything was awesomeThe valducci pasta with chicken was amazing it had olives artichoke hearts with penne pasta and a creamy tomato sauceMmmmm my mouth is waterin wishing I kept some fr lunch todayThe service was very good we had 4 kis with us so that's no easy task server was all over the bread and drink refills Thank you I will be cming back.
4440,0,"Having been regulars for the past 10 years last spring my family and I went to eat there for a celebration We were surprised to see the change in the layout of the restaurant There was more  production of noise which was very distracting because the booths were awkwardly shaped (a quarter circle and the rest in chairs) for three people that you can hear your neighbor's conversation while waiting for your meal The menu was downsized and it didn't have the quality selections that my family and I use to chose from so for me I settled for a mushroom burger We were not pleased with the service either because they did a tag-team version so we were confused on who was ""helping"" us and it was taking a while to ask for a simple glass of water We found it very rude when they would take our plates away without even bother asking I did not enjoy my meal that day and we do not plan on returning to this poorly functioned restaurant."
4945,0,Not good  I used to eat here regularly but haven't been to Malees in a couple years  It has REALLY gone downhill  Bad food terrible service and an overall disappointment  :( Not going back.
3205,0,Service is SLOOOOOOW at best Took ten (10) minutes to get a drink refill and our waitress only had three tables She also was uninterested in the customers and had zero personality (not a requirement for the job but hey at least let the customer THINK you are having a semi-decent day) I guess all the cars in the parking lot were from diners at Indulge Burger or Jersy Mikes The chain has tried to up their food choices and quality in part by offering sizzling skillets I ordered one and there was not one sizzle to be heard besides the sizzle in my mouth from the INSANELY spicy sausage I couldn't eat it and might I add nowhere on the menu did it mention it was even slightly spicy I could have breathed fireI guess there's a reason why you're half empty on a Sunday morning - will never go there again Ugh.
1046,1,This is one of my favorite restaurants We've been going to Eddie V's for several years and usually go about two to three times per month You can't go wrong with anything on the menu I always go back to my favorites which are: crab cakes Jonah crab claws wedge salad either Parmesan crusted lemon sole snapper meuniere or a halibut special when in season au gratin potatoes sugar snap peas crab fried rice sauteed spinach Godiva chocolate dessert bananas foster I don't like shrimp but my husband swears by the shrimp cocktail or any of the shrimp dishes They have a huge wine list and many specialty drinks Dining on the back patio is great Wonderful views.
986,1,One of the best restaurants I have been to in awhile  Each course was better than the last  Started with Melon gazpacho charcuterie ceaser salad and pasta with sausage The food was truly outstanding  The service was great  We sat outdoors on a beautiful December day  So refreshing to get such good food at a hotelI almost forgotthe bread budding  To die for  With dulce di leche on the side.
2498,1,I keep coming back but havent been lately I would rather go here over any other place in the metro.
3538,0,First time here Went to see Christopher Titus This place is a place for comics to test new material Comic used cue cards Paid 60 bucks to go see him 2 drink minimum per person Took my wife Totally cool with that Had 4 or 5 cocktails wife had 3 Expected maybe a 80 dollar tab for less than a 25 dollar bottle of whiskey 150 bucks Are you f-ing kidding me Now I know why maybe 50 people showed up Never go back there again What a rip off I can get full bottle service at that price If I could id give this place negative stars Thanks for slapping the bill on the table after the comic is done with his test runs and starts with his good material Ruined the night Just wanted to take my wife out for her birthday.
2712,1,Great sushi place Went with some out of town friendsThey were hesitant at first because they didn't relate Phoenix with good sushiThey left happy and with changed mindsWe shared several rolls the names escape me nowI love their iced green tea It actually had flavor the best green tea I ever hadI will return here soon with my local sushi eaters.
3969,0,Unfortunately I don't have a good thing to share regarding the practice of Sundin & Fish  As a new business owner with little to no tax knowledge I trusted the practice to guide me  Let's face it from the outside this firm is very regal and appears to be the end all be all for accounting firms  The first year the firm did our taxes it was easy and painless  The moment I started asking for help or asking questions I would receive that will cost you $120+ per hour we don't give info over the phone and I'd get referred to some website to search for an answer  After paying hundreds of dollars for completed returns an SCorp filing and a DBA filing and not knowing how to move forward I called  Once again I was told it was a fee to talk to them  The receptionist Jeanie along with both Fish brothers speak down to their customers-they have little to no respect and are completely unwilling to help-even after spending HUNDREDS of dollars for their services  It's as if they expect you to know how to do their job and get annoyed and frustrated when you don't know tax  I've NEVER received such horrific service from what appeared to be a reputable company  I'm at year end didn't pull a salary never was explained what needed to happen and I'm needing to have a salary shown NOW  Well isn't that greatthere goes my income for the rest of the year because the estimates they provided were far from accurate  I've sought out someone new for my taxes and have since learned that the little I was guided to do was very shady and unethical.
4343,0,Terrible  Way overpriced worse than it's nearby competitors in every measurable way.
1146,1,In N Out Burger is hands down the best fast food place I've ever eaten at The food actually tastes good unlike most mass fast food chains The burgers are to die for as are the fries I love how everything is made fresh daily and the fries are cut in the store The one thing I don't like is how it seems everyone in Phoenix seemed to be at this location when I was there I guess the fact that it was the day after Christmas and that it's near Paradise Valley Mall didn't help that We couldn't find a table so we tried eating outside but it was way too cold and windy (I was visiting from Cleveland so I was shocked at the cold weather) so we ate in our car in the parking lot It was worth it though Hands down In N Out is one of the best burger places in America Now they just need to come to the Great Lakes region.
2768,1,Haven't been to Roy's in years and what was i thinking  It was sooo good  We went for restaurant week but added on some items  Started with their speciality Hawaiian Martini very pineapple good but liked the wine list and the choices more  We had the calamari as an extra app before we did the pre-fix menu  YUM  Then had the scallops so good but very small maybe b/c of the restaurant week special  My mom had the tomato and aspargus simple but good  i then had the petite fliet cooked to perfection  Mom had the trout said it was great  She kept thinking it was Salmon thoughi stole some of her cous-cous sooo good  We finished with the flourless chocolate cake  So rich but so good  I bet if i could have the ice cream with it it wouldn't be so rich but who cares  Over all a GREAT meal  Mom said best she had all restaurant week.
4902,0,This restaurant doesn't even deserve one star We went to have a meal before the movie and decided to try Cafe Pino The endive salad was terrible no taste and overpriced We told the waiter that we did not like it at all and he started to argue with us He said that the other table just had four of those salads and THEY LOVED IT Very arrogant I think he must have been related to the owner otherwise I think he would be fired by now All the waiters walk around looking so miserable no one smiling just rushing around No one came to our table to provide additional ice tea Overall the service stinks and the prices are inflated for what you get.
1317,1,FEZ You have redeemed yourself I love you again Service this time around was amazing Thomas the general manager is super fun Monica our server did a great job The food was delicious I had the lamb chops To die for My friend had the rib eye Also very good Oh Fez I will come back to you again and again.
97,1,I don't shop at Banana Republic I never have and I probably never will HOWEVER I did decide to purchase my bridesmaids gowns from Banana Republic and I have to say I have never experienced better retail customer service To make a very very long story short: The dresses I wanted were almost impossible to find I ended up purchasing two from two separate locations and having one shipped from California The associate at this store Vicki personally called and had it shipped for me She was extremely patient and very helpful I was absolutely shocked (and gracious) at the outstanding customer service I received at this store Thank you.
4377,0,We bought tires less than 2 1/2 years ago from this Fletcher  They were Firestone tires which have splitting issues    They are  now splitting and are not standing by their warranty  Interesting that Fletcher no longer sells Firestone tires  That's because they sold us a bad product  DO NOT buy tires here  They do not stand by their product   Go to Big O or Discount Tire  I know they warrant their tires.
505,1,The Decor is NICE  staff was nice and attentive Food is amazing  This is one of my favorite Resturant .
3699,0,Yeah walked in took one one look around one whiff of air and walked right back out My impression in that 30 seconds was enough to send me packing Gross Crowded Humid and smelly Tiny area and tiny selection of books I am a library lover And this place is only a mile from me so if there was a chance of it being worth my time I'd go but no Yuck.
3547,0,Horrible greasy foodGm didn't care at all when we complainedManagement reflects overall very poor experience My tummy still hurts.
4786,0,The customer service here was absolutely horrendous I was in a party of 6 and was told it would be 30-40 minutes to be seated After checking back in with the hostess 4 or 5 times it ended up taking over 2 hours to be seated Apparently the hostess was unaware that even though the 6-person tables were occupied 6 people could be seated by placing together any of the unused 4 person tables with any of the unused 2-person tables By the time we were seated half the restaurant was empty but there was a large contingent of angry people still waiting to be seated Additionally the waitress was terrible offered nothing to compensate for the long wait screwed up our order and argued with someone at our table regarding what she ordered The food was good but I'll never go back.
4616,0,I took my daughter here on 4-20-2013 and they were able to get me in a last min apt Well i wish they didn't I hardly get my nails done and when I do i want to get pampered The women doing my daughters nails had no clue what to do with her even though they clearly stated child mani padie they rushed us in and out of the chair with my spa mani and pedi taking 23 min for both at a not worth it value of $55 for both of us The women who had me clearly had callouses on her hands that were rough on my feet along with her answering her phone to her husband during my hand rub that lasted 30 sec each hand I will never waste my hard earned money here again.
2132,1,Just had our first experience with TIMO Outstanding Food ambiance service etcThe tapas are terrific and the environment is great Try the bruschetta the lamb chop tapa's  the escargot and the creme brulee You won't regret itFans of Postino's will find it a worthy competitor/alternative.
1620,1,Visiting from Atl my husband and I chose grassroots from yelp reviews  When asking our server what her favorite salad was she stated veg chop with avocado  It wasn't the most expensive salad(so I knew she was truthful) By far best salad I have eve had What a treat and so fresh and healthy Husband had bbq chicken and he loved it He is a very picky eater  Our service was timely pleAsant and didn't overstay their welcome  The owner Chris  was extremely nice and gave us a heartfelt welcome  We may be back for dinner.
4273,0,Don't waste your time The waitresses are beyond slow and once they are done flirting with the table next to you she might  visit your table and then disappear.
4768,0,I've been seeing Dr Reddy and Marie Perkins since 2005  Here's how it always goes:  Schedule an appt with the doctor but find out when you arrive that they actually have you seeing the Physicians Assistant Marie Perkins even though you specifically requested Dr Reddy and made the appointment to see her well in advance Wait well over an hour in waiting room Then have Marie be curt and rude w/you while NOT listening to anything you have to share Then she will order your meds for Formulary after you told her generic is what you're insurance will coverAs for the office staffIf you get VERY abnormal lab results the assistant will leave you a msg to call back ASAP but then won't return your call for several days while you wait I have been seeing Dr Reddy and Marie for over 8 years and nothing ever changes I want to find a new endo but there are no others that I can find in Chandler I have seen numerous patients walk out of the office waiting room swearing never to return after they've gotten completely fed up I will need to succumb to finding a new doctor and make the drive to Scottsdale or downtown At least the office wait won't run over 2 hours like it does routinely at Endocrinology Associates.
1747,1,I have not been in the store so I can't speak on that but they have a great selection and will go out of there way to find a book  Prices are high but fair if you're looking for a 60 year old book in perfect condition you're not going to find it for the jacket price  If I ever get out to AZ I will stop by.
3013,1,"We went on a Friday night and even though it is off season here the place was packed Never the less the service was impeccable as always This is our third trip here and we have never been disappointed I had the 14 Oz NY strip and my wife had the prime rib Both were cooked to perfection and seasoned ever so  wonderfully My wife tells me the horseradish is the real deal and not the runny stuff you get elsewherecan't vouch as I hate the stuff  From the bread to the desert every bite was worth taking The old time ambiance with the dark wood and red ""leather"" booths are welcoming It's pricey and if you can ignore the geek with khakis no socks and deck shoes ever so gently cradling his wine(you KNOW the guy and he is everywhere) in the middle of a Phoenix summer it is worth every single cent."
3089,0,I order over the phone tuna tataki 3hand roll and asked if 2california 1spicy tuna and tempura vegetable it took over 40 min wen my husband picked it up I couldn't believe the hand rolls were the size of a felt pen and the paper sea weed crumble in my hand He had charge us 4700 so I call and told him he said he would correct and give us back like 1500 that he charge to much so another half hour later we get back the 3 rolls the only one that was right was tuna the other two I don't know no California hand roll the last 3time I Was there it was again over price and did not get for my money I'm done going therenot worth it.
1443,1,You're not going to be disappointed at Distrito that's for sure From the margaritas made with premium tequilas and fresh squeezed juices to the flavorful meats tacos and ceviches this place is a must go to for Mexican Food Being a native to AZ I'm super picky about where I'll good Mexican food and Distrito hits a home run in my opinion I also love the decor It's kitschy and classy It's such a fun restaurant I'm getting hungry writing this review.
4515,0,Do NOT eat here  Two of my friends were in town for the PF Chang's half marathon and wanted some post race food before heading on a long drive back home  I pulled the Sandwich Club off of the Yelp iPhone App and it had an 85% rating (so I figured it had to be great)We got there and waded through the huge crowd at the Daily Dose and sat down at an empty patio (one thing should tell you if a place sicks is if there is a long wait at the restaurant next door and NO spill over into the other restaurant)  We got sat right away and were greeted by a waitress who was a major space cadette  She couldn't even tell us what sides came with the sandwichesWe ordered an appetizer of guac and chips ($7) and we got processed guac from a bag and some gross round crappy tortilla chips  That right there set the scene for the rest of the meal  I ordered a grilled cheese that on the menu sounds awesome but when I got it the cheese wasn't even melted  It was just sweaty half warm with more of that crappy guacamole instead of fresh slices of avacado  My friend ordered avacado to go on her BLT and got the same gross guacamole when she commented to the waitress that saying avacado vs gaucamole on the menu was misleading the waitress proceeded to argue with her  This restaurant sucked and for the price and location the food was not worth it.
4448,0,We have ended up at this buffet a couple of times because it was in the area  However the customer service is terrible everytime  It is way over priced for the quality of their food  We are never satisfied when we leave this place.
909,1,"I love this place  I was on the hunt for the perfect ring for my woman  I walked in and was greeted promptly but it wasn't an immediate ""Here buy our jewels"" kind of deal  The folks behind the counter let me come to them and weren't pushy thank God cause I probably would have left  They have really beautiful stuff here some new and some estate  I found ""the ring"" several months ago but didn't make the purchase until after I had a few visits with it  I wanted to make sure it was right  They remembered who I was when I first came back and that means a lot to me When I made my final payment earlier this week the lady was almost as excited as me  I love supporting the local folk and I hope that if and when you want some new bling you'll give this place a shot."

3837,0,"Again it really does pain me to give low stars but my experience there was quite terribleNOTE: I tried Katana several times in 2010 (when I first moved here) and wanted to see if they were new-and-improved in 2013 For me they've gotten worseI was craving sushi one night so I called for take-out of salmon sashimi Philly roll and Rainbow roll The girl who took my order (Brittany) said it would be ready in 25 min Okay - great See you thenI gave them 30 minutes (just in case they were slammed) Showed up and Brittany seemed a little flustered and kept apologizing that my order wasn't ready and made a quick phone call Okayyy Mind you - no one is sitting in the dining area No oneAfter 5 or 10 min a couple of patrons came in and were seated Still not readyMore time elapsed and the sushi chef (don't know his name) came through the main entrance w/a box of food Thought I caught a glimpse of cucumber and perhaps other veggies More time elapsedChef apologized to me and said ""5 more minutes"" - I nodded and smiled Finally order came out (WAYYYY over-priced too)After about an hour wait (total) the sushi was quite disgusting - I must say Way too salty and it just tasted ""warm"" in some wierd way Salmon sashimi was pretty decent - good cuts and okay quality That was the only thing I finishedWill not be returning here in the near future - but I still have hopes for this place to turn itself around."
3342,0,I was looking for a better pizza than my Little Caesars or Dominos near my home Being the discounter I found that Papa John's had a decent pizza for a nice price I built my pie online and set up a carryout option with cash payment Soon I received a confirmation email with all my order information and an ETA of about 20 mins or so I sent my boyfriend within ten mins to go pick our dinner up When he arrived the front counter attendant couldn't find our pizza leaving Joe to wait an additional thirty mins or so (He was at the correct location) The attendant then handed my boyfriend TWO pizzas Clearly not our order  After finding what they thought was our pie based on the ingredient selection it was luke warm at best and had a sticker for a different client and phone number I was EXTREMELY disappointed with our experience I never write reviews-certainly not a bad one- however I needed to tell you readers Rosati's is worth the gas OR try another location.
2691,0,My wife and I were in need of 15 tons of garden soil to fill our six new raised gardens beds We ran a quick search on Craig's List and found a local company named Arizona Rock Depot AZ Rock Depot's co-owner Rex responded to our email inquiry within a few hours with a quoteThe price seemed reasonable enough so we scheduled a delivery for the following Tuesday The delivery was for the 15 tons of garden soil and 7 tons of granite I explained to Rex it was imperative that both loads were on the ground by 8 AM Tuesday as I would have a tractor man there to move the material simultaneously Rex repeated back the delivery schedule and instructions and took my credit card informationThat Thursday my doorbell rang at 6:00 AM It was a driver from AZ Rock Depot with a load of dirt I explained to him that he had been misinformed and that the delivery was to be made on Tuesday four days away He leftTuesday morning came and by 7:00 there was no sign of Az Rock Depot I called Rex' number repeated and left several anxious emails I finally received a text message at 7:15 informing that the truck was just leaving the yard We are less than 30 minutes from his yard At 8:00 I shot back another text asking where the trucks were Rex replies that they were on the way but only one truck was en route The same truck would have to unload Drive back to the yard fill and return I grumbled to Rex that this was not the agreement I needed both materials on the ground at 8 as agreed because my tractor man would have to pull from both piles at the same timeRex snapped back that he would just cancel the delivery then He realized I was in a vulnerable situation with a crew standing by so he decided to go on the attack I informed him that if he left me hanging I would hold him liable for any losses due to breach of contract The threat of a small claims action a BBB complaint and a hit on Yelp didn't deter him Rex was going to teach me a lesson for complaining He turned back the delivery (I doubt it was ever en route anyhow) and left me and my crew hangingI called to lodge a complaint with the local nursery which promotes AZ Rock Depot's products and services The nursery informed me that Rex and his partner were new owners and had just assumed ownership within the past two weeks They apologized profusely for the trouble caused by RexYou would think that a management team who had been at the helm of a company just two weeks would be doing all they could be in order to establish and retain customers They seem intent instead of burning down their new business with incompetent scheduling and an unbridled belligerence towards any customer they failWhy would anyone tolerate such incompetence and poor customer service with so many reputable companies around We scrambled to find another company who had both loads on the ground within 45 minutes.
1294,1,Ever wondered what it's like to visit the Secret Garden I imagine the atmosphere would sort of be like the patio at Cafe Monarch Head past the intimate chef's kitchen dining room which seats about 10 and through the gorgeous indoor restaurant that will make you feel like you're in a castle dining room and walk out to the patio covered in candles featuring a fountain and ensconced with flowers It's one of the most romantic restaurants in the Valley I've ever been to and it re-opens Friday October 4 after new ownershipEvery night Cafe Monarch features a unique three-course prix fixe menu based on seasonal items and Chef Andrew Nienke's taste Call ahead if you have special dietary needs and they'll adjust the menu accordingly for youI went there last week with some girlfriends -- thank you so much to new owner Christian Lewkowicz for the invitation -- and had one of the freshest meals I've ever had We started with a watermelon salad which came with huge chunks of juicy watermelon and a bed of fresh greens I love watermelon salad and this one was extra-tastyMy pals had salmon and filets for their entrees while I got to nibble on quinoa topped with fresh carrots and leeks The portion size was huge and left me stuffedFor dessert we were treated to freshly baked puff pastries topped with fresh berries and vanilla ice cream I slurped up every bite of the dessert which was light and refreshing and managed to seem healthy because of the fruit My favorite part of Cafe Monarch though was the atmosphere and hospitality The service was amazing and made you feel like you were in your own little world -- perfect for an anniversary dinner or special get-together Our meals would have cost $45 each which was a steal for such unique culinary creations and such top-notch ingredients The relaxed atmosphere will transport you out of the Valley for a night and make you feel like you're in your own private retreat.
4757,0,"I have been a member of Restaurant Depot for about 6 months now and I find the customer service to be horrible They are constantly out of stock on many items and the employees walk around with no sense of urgency as if they are doing you a favor by being there If by some stroke of luck you happen to find one of their employees shuffling around the store and you ask them a question don't expect an educated answer just expect a glazed over look as if you were speaking in a foreign language and expect the answer to be ""I'm not sure"" or ""I don't know"" I have literally asked when an item would be back in stock and have gotten the answer ""it could be any time there is no way of knowing"" as if every time they get a delivery it is a surprise Once you are finally done crusading through the gauntlet of disappointment be prepared to stand in line for at least 20 minutes even if you only have 2 items as they have no organization or concern as to their speed of service After all business owners have all the time in the world and are never pressed for time yes that was sarcasm Once it is finally your turn to be checked out keep your fingers crossed that your cashier doesn't leave mid check out and yes this has happened to me several times In closing I have rarely ever left Restaurant Depot with out being more stressed out more annoyed and out of time If I had any other Restaurant Supply options in the area I would be spending my money there already."
2878,1,This buffet is possibly the best I have ever had That is really saying something because I have been to Vegas 17 times in the last 4 years    Thought it would be nice for my mom and I to check out a local buffet so I jumped on yelp and found the reviews for this place I have driven by here many times but really never noticed it We went on a Monday night and expected it to be pretty busy Lucky for us the place was almost empty when we arrived We were seated at a very nice booth and placed our drink order At first I did not see where the actual buffet was until I noticed people walking through the archways and into another room I think that's a nice touch Makes eating a but more relaxed and quiet        We walked in and checked out everything before starting to fill our plates Pretty nice selection Lots of very nice cold meats and cheeses These turned out to be very good as I tried several I tried most everything they had to offer and was really blown away by the quality and freshness The prime rib was excellent as was the pork chops and especially the duck drum sticks These were my favorite and I ate my weight in them to prove it         The deserts were also very good I tried bites of several different cakes and pies and indulged in the gelato as well I did not notice the crepe station until I was picking out my gelato It looked like they were making bananas foster so I went for a closer look Low and behold that's just what they were doing Well I had to have some of this I ended up having them place it on a crepe instead of gelato This was fantastic as was every other desert we tried        All in all the buffet was excellent Everything was very fresh with top quality all the way down the line We are going to go again for mothers day when they have a special menu Can't wait        Give this place a try you won't regret it.
1344,1,I've been to now two locations and love it the same every time We always order the Chicago and are always pleased My family is from Chicago and have found our very own taste of home every time we go here service is great and quality needs no explaining I already miss the city but know a memory is only around the corner try it yourself thank me later.
2986,1,Oh Gammage how I do love thee My husband and I usually see 1-2 shows a year  I would definitely see more if we could afford it  It's so much fun  I've always found Gammage to be comfortable and does a fine job providing that classic theater environment  It's big enough to house big shows so you feel like you're getting a Broadway experience every time you go  Someone on here complained about parking but they have their lot as well as parking garages  You must not have seen them  We've never been without a space and we have gone at various times of the year I work at ASU and I like to walk to Gammage sometimes over lunch  It's such a pretty building with pretty landscaping  And sometimes I can hear bits of rehearsals going on which is always fun.
3877,0,I know this review won't stop people from going here just want management know things need to change The food and beer are pretty decent Came a few weeks ago for dinner on a particularly cold night We were seated at the only open table Near the doorway to outside This doorway was open and it was FREEZING We were told we could not move tables Nobody came to take an order which is funny because we were near the server station to run bills There were 5-6 serves standing there ignoring us After 20-25 mins we got up and left I told the hostesses on our way out Also they didn't do anything Very disappointing.
2820,0,service awful menu changed  They charge for onions and peppers in potatoes there cream of corn is awful there is an herb in it and they do not tell you what it is and they say they do not know  Also there is no bread basket you have to ask for it the food portions like pork chops has no bone it is small and the augratin potatoes is white not baked and awful.
1120,1,We take our schnauzer and our long haired dachshund here and they do an excellent job with both Never had any complaints about service or quality of work in the 4 or so times we have gone there Also there is (or was) a discount for school teachers Prompt service good  work cheap prices Not much else you can ask for Easier to get an appointment in the summer when all the snowbirds have left with their sundry lap dogs.
3453,0,After a long morning of volunteering at a local animal shelter my coworkers and I sat down at the famous (infamous) Los Dos Molinos for a filling lunch  I know 10 people at lunch is a challenge but the place was empty and we were treated like it was a major inconvenience  Service was slow and unfriendly I was never asked if I even wanted a drink I had to make a significant assertion to get one glass of diet coke  I ordered two chicken tacos with no cheese no beans I know it sounds boring but it is what I wanted to have for lunch  I received pork tacos and a plate full of beans  So how was the food I can imagine dog waste tasting better than the taco that I ate  Hell I can make better soft tacos in my home kitchen anytime and run circles around this placeAdditionally my coworker did not get his chili relleno until 15 minutes after everyone else was served and it looked more like soft green chili slop more than anything elseTo top it all off it took ages to get a check and when we did they would not allow us to pay separately   Needless to say I will not be returning to this place  For much better food service and cleanliness check out La Pinata near 16th Ave and Thomas it is awesome.
3411,0,Stumbled upon this place around dinner time and decided to give it a try Bad decisionI will first give you the worst My fiance had explosive diarrhea all night after eating here He ordered Ichi RollI wish I had read the review on this restaurant then I would have avoided this place The other reviewer has described this Ichi Roll I completely agree Gross In addition to what he described this roll is huge the size of a burger patti No roll should be so big that you can't fit in your mouth That just goes to show the chef does not know Japanese cuisineI ordered dragon roll which is eel and avocado Overall flavor is okay but the texture of the fish is mushier than usual that it makes me think perhaps it's not freshThe green tea Watered down Not much flavorEdamame Tasted like store bought Edamame but it's the kind that's overstocked and about to expire You get the IdeaSo will I come back to this restaurant You tell me.
699,1,"What do you say about a place that is almost universally lovedWhat else can you do but heap more praise onto it at the risk of seeming sycophantic Lux is certainly amongst the best of the best for coffee in all of the greater phoenix metropolitan area In all five areas of criterion:~Taste: * * * * * the coffee brewed and sold here is perfect the confections and baked goods are simply wonderful~Decor: * * * * * note the striking array of chairs and seating along w/ additional patio seating make for optimal outside and inside digs~Pricing: * * * * * nothing here is expensive and considering the quality of the product sold very economical~Service: * * * * * the barristas are helpful friendly and good natured perfectly willing to explain the menu and offer tips advice please tip them~Ambience: * * * * * this ties in w/ decor but is meant to be more along the lines of ""scene"" and the players in that scene the folks who frequent Lux are my kinda folks (not as much as conspire but close) young professional hip artsy intelligent down town people who know good coffee when they see/smell/taste itSo hoped that helped for the fence sitters if for some reason you were perched precariously upon the fence to beging with."
277,0,"The only good thing about this place is the location It's less than a block away from US Airways ArenaWe decided to eat at this Pizza joint because we just finished watching Disney on Ice and my nephew was hungry The guy behind the counter was very rude and pushy on selling his ""Combo Deal"" which includes a Slice of Pizza Salad and a Drink for $550 I told him I didn't want to order the Combo deal but wanted to order a Whole PieHe says it takes about 45 minutes to make a Whole pie Answer me this: What Whole Pie takes 45 minutes to make Since he made it seem that  I had no other option so instead I ordered 5 slices and two soft drinks Each slice had to be reheated in the oven It took 15 minutes til our pizza was finally ready to eat At least that's what I thought  The Pizza was extremely hot greasy and tasteless I wish I read the reviews prior and would've just waited to eat somewhere closer to home with better pizza."
1136,1,This is a wonderful place to take your pets - they give outstanding care to your animals All the staff are incredibly friendly and knowledgeable and Dr Pruden is so gentle and caring My dog has had valley fever for a few years now and she has kept me in the loop all the way explaining all the options available discussing everything fully and making sure I know what needs to be done and why This is a place I would recommend to anyone who values who looks after their pet's health.
4603,0,this bank is terrible and will charge you unfounded fees it is a hassle to try and communicate with this bank and their customer service is terrible i would not recommend this bank unless it is for someone you don't like and would like them to become financial screwed.
124,0,I go to this cookie cutter pseudo Chinese/Asian place purely because of the convenience I sometimes just don't have the time and need something quickly so I generally like the online order ability  But come on placing an order at 7 pm showing up and paying for it and not having it ready until 7:45  I mean WTF is that.
2869,0,"OHSO is one of the many declining restaurants that is propped up by good food and a wide selection of beers and being dragged down by poor service I once went there for breakfast and had a waiter that was really spacey and inattentive He had to be reminded of orders and things he forgot more than once When I pointed out that fruit on my plate was moldy he took the single moldy piece of fruit off the plate ant set it back on my table reminding me that sometimes these things happen Really I've never been served moldy food before That is disgusting and the completely wrong attitude I took that experience as a red flag but didn't think it was damning Yet another visit clued me in that my money is better spent elsewhereI went one night and sat in the bar one weeknight after the dinning room had closed Just after I ordered food and drinks and group of people went from the bar to the patio to smoke The patio opening is as wide as the patio so the smoke naturally blows into the bar I mention the smoke to the bartender who brought our drinks and before I finished speaking she cut me off and said ""because you're sensitive"" in a completely inappropriate tone I should have just left then and there There is no excuse to be that rude to a guest Our food comes and it's less than impressive The fries in my order were recooked When the waiter cleared our table he dropped the two uneaten cups of mustard that come with the pretzels on the floor He was upset because he got mustard on his pants He wasn't that upset that he'd gotten it on the floor which explains why he left it there When I left the table I slipped and nearly fell from it What kind of jackass just dumps something you could slip on in front of your table I tried calling the restaurant to voice my discontent and no one would ever pick up the phone I sent a message through a forum on their website The response I got back was defensive and told me I should have talked to a manager that night So should I have talked to the rude bartender or the guy to busy to clean up the mustard from the floor The message might as well have just been a suggestion of other restaurants to visit instead."
948,0,I was desperate for food during my layover a the Phoenix airport and fell upon Barrio Cafe  Not many vegan or vegetarian options  I ended up ordering some kind of veggie sandwich which was okay  It came with this delicious yellow sauce that made the sandwich edible I was told that it was tomatillo sauce- yea I'm pretty sure that was inaccurate  What was disappointing about this place was how unwilling they were to accommodate your dietary needs  No substituions or changes you order what's on the menu That's it  And no salsa or chips to start-- I was told they didn't even have traditional salsa in stock Rather rude staff tooAnd of course prices are quite inflated to properly exploit your hunger during your airport visitI encourage you to bring some snacks before going to this airport.
512,1,"I will never see a movie any other way This place is going to put cinema supper club out of business Food:  From Tanza - excellent The trick is to get there 20 minutes early so you get your food early and you're not eating in the day  I've been here a few times now and I haven't any complaints  Even the wait-staff is incredibly friendly Alcohol:  There is an awesome wine dispenser How very 2012  But there's also a bar that serves to ipic - it's called ""Salt""  I would like to recommend the el-corazon - unsalted 2 of those and I was ready to make out with my husband in the theater The seats:   It's so worth is to sit in the VIP seating Seats recline you get a pillow and super-soft blanket and UNLIMITED popcorn Really  I'm moving in Become a member and tuesdays are discount days Membership is FREE."

682,1,Yay Phoenix You did this one rightI've always been able to find what I need I'm not sure that I love or hate the architecture but I did read about it in Dwell which is always just a bit impressive My only beef iswhy isn't there a cafe Does that make me a yuppie for wanting a coffee house in my library I promise it's only cause I desperately need the caffeine Either wayI love espresso and a good book But this library is top notch if you ask me.
237,1,I have been to a lot of nail salons and this one is by far the bast Service was great and they do a great job Go here.
3804,0,I was expecting this place to be a nice resort  The place is kind of newly established because it was really hard to find this place in the evening  There are no signs if you come from the back and there is a lot of construction going onAlthough they make an effort for it to look nice my room was facing a trailer park and some desolate houses   It seems like it's at the edge of town  Not to mention there was a sign on my hotel door that said to use the double bolted lock at night  The bed was okay the sheets could and blanket could have been more luxurious  Good thing I got free internet because I was there on businessThey put me in the building furthest from the lobby so it took about 5 minutes to walk there  I didn't get a sense of it being safe if I walked there at night  They had no express checkout so I tried checking out using their television  That also didn't work and when I called the front desk about three times nobody picked up  I just left anyways because I didn't want to be late for my flightThe only good thing is that they give free bottled water in the room  But before you get excited it's just crappy cheap water nothing nice  Oh and there is a Starbucks if you'd like to walk all the way to the lobby again  I was dissapointed and frankly I would rather stay somewhere else next time.
2166,1,Not much to say about FEZ except they have excellent food and drinks I usually go with the sirloin and potatoes and its always good perfectly They also have a good selection of spirits in addition to a few special made cocktails Atmosphere is perfect modern and trendy without any holier than thou feelings Happy hour is every day as well go.
818,1,I have never eaten at El Pollo Loco before but decided to try them out today and get lunch for myself and coworkers  I went on their website which is easy to maneuver and found a nice catering menu  When I went to place my order it told me that because I didn't order 12 hours in advance I would need to call the store directly  I was worried they wouldn't be able to fill my order because I needed it in the next 2 hours but a very friendly man answered the phone and told me he could indeed have my order ready in time  I ordered 2 taquito platters which were very tasty and reasonably priced  When I went to the store to pick them up they also gave me extra tins for salsa from their salsa bar as well as plates and utensils  I definitely will be coming here again and I look forward to trying their other menu items.
1679,1,This place is great We've been coming here for the last few years and they always do a great job Reasonably priced prompt service and friendly customer service What more could you ask for The owner of the company is often in and is very friendly and often the one checking in the clothes and ringing you up - it's nice to see a hands-on owner that cares about his customers Always happy to support local businesses.
3517,0,Boo Went with a big birthday group after confirming business hours Got their well over 30 mins before their posted closing business time Told us kitchen was already closed and turned us awayI would understand if it was a bar/sportsbar where they have last calls for kitchen food and a bar to operate later than their kitchen If a restaurant has certain hours I was always under the impression the kitchen is open until the closing time May take a while for me to want to come back here Even tried to plead our case and it was a no go as the host sat there counting his money Wow.
1362,1,as the holidays fade into the calendar behind me i reflect back on the month of december and i realize i spent the entire past month attending an ocean of parties drinking a river of christmas cocktails and wading through a forest of friends at random gatherings in a haze of booze and mistletoeit was festive it was fun and it was exhausting as i scroll back through the rolodex of 2010 holiday memories the R Bar most certainly stands out as one of my top 5 favorite eveningsour very big group of holiday revelers was initially seated indoors as we waited for a circle of chairs surrounding a fire pit to free up right after we ordered our first round the sweetheart of a hostess ran over to let us know the party sitting there had just closed their tab and we could pounce on the coveted area once our group was seated outdoors in over sized lounge chairs beneath twinkle lights by a crackling fire i took note of the rest of our surroundings stunning a striking desert rock formation as a backdrop waterfalls roaring a moat trickling through live music filled the air laughter conversation clinking glassesi don't know if it was the group i was there with the energy of the crowd or that everyone seems to be in an especially happy mood during the holidays but the air had an electricity to it that night i settled back into the cushions poured myself deep into a cocktail and let me date hold my hand  we ended up staying until closing time and then finally moved onto a new venuealas R Bar is the kind of place you don't remember much about the service because it was so flawlessly executed you don't remember the name of your drink only that it tasted divine and you barely remember the conversations you had only that you laughed the entire timehowever you DO remember you hated leaving and couldn't wait to come backPS: ok i lied i did remember ordering the rose margarita a few times and yummmm.
2857,1,I loved Kokomo I have yet to go to a fro yo store as clean as Kokomo The fruits were so fresh and the topping section was clean with a great variety I also found it charming that I got to meet with the friendly owners Kokomo beats all the yogurt store in this area  I didn't feel guilty because the yogurt is so healthy I highly recommend Kokomo.
873,0,The manager and owner of this establishment needs to be reprimanded for his disregard for basic health and safety practices in his store  The manager accidentally spilled burning hot coffee on my brother today at the register  Instead of tending to my brother's burnt leg he simply wiped up the spill on the counter and offered up a weak apology   I worked at Starbucks for 6 years and I would never tend to a small counter spill before I offered up a wet cloth or burn cream to a customer who had been burned  Especially if the spill was my fault My concern for the employees who work here and customers who frequent this spot (which will no longer be me) is that there was no proper first aid to treat his burn  When my brother asked for something for his burn the manager dug around for a bit before producing a bottle of NIVEA BOTANICAL HAND CREAM  At this point I approached the register and asked what they had in their first aid to treat burns because Nivea hand cream was not acceptable for his burnt leg  He returned to the first aid kit and offered my brother a tube of antibacterial soapThis should be of great concern to the friendly people who work there and to the loyal customers who visit  Please consider that all food and beverage establishments should have at the bare minimum a BASIC first aid kit that includes burn cream  This manager should sincerely hope that none of his employees are burned or injured at this establishment because he would have a serious lawsuit on his hands  Same goes for his customers.
1111,0,Awful experience My girlfriend and I just wanted a quick bite that wouldn't make us feel like crap so we fell for the Applebee's ad for low calorie options We got there and we're seated near the door despite there being plenty of room in the restaurant They seated a man who appeared to be homeless and providing his own beverage choices (he poured a clear liquid into his water glass) We didn't get to order for about 15 minutes We both ordered an under 500 calorie meal and neither of us finished it It looked like a diet microwave meal dumped on the plate Some of the shrimp were overcooked and rubbery while others were undercooked and translucent  Not going back even though it is just down the street.
3730,0,The service is good but the food is not great The pizza was soggy and had very little toppings looked and tasted like cheese pizza We requested that they should add more toppings so they added little bit more topping on the existing pizza which ended up tasting terrible The manager spoke to us and advised us that we should have ordered double topping A large pizza and with three toppings cost $22  to $25 (the food is not cheap)  There are so many good pizza restaurants in the valley who serve tasty pizza's and do not skimp on toppings  I have no plans to visit this restaurant in the future.
4741,0,Let's see - the last and only other review for this branch was a little over two years ago and was two stars Which for me is too manyWhile at some point I am sure I will write a story with my experiences in sorting out the financial cluster-fuck my mom created and didn't leave a master map for - it will probably need to be marketed as fiction but still quite entertaining as long as it didn't happen to your lifetoday is not that day - so I will skip some of the more sordid details for nowFor Yelp review purposes - FIVE visits to the bank in person dealing face to face with people to continually be given partial information irrelevant information and negligently incorrect informationAll for a halfhearted apology and a bottle of water LovelyHere's the thing Wells - my mother had accounts with you for many years My stepfather has an account with you Had I been treated well had I been treated with any value and respect and even a modicum of interest I may have started an account with you I would have been a relatively easy sell However not only was I not convinced I'd get stellar service if I were your customer I was so disgusted by the horrible communication and mediocre at best service that there's no way I'd ever consider an account with you You effectively drove away my business before you even got it Granted - I am not the Sultan of Brunei or any relation to Bill Gates - the lack of my business won't effect your bottom line in any notable way You'll never feel the pinch of having driven a way a potential small time checking and savings account customer But if you keep it up there may be enough of us that is DOES make a difference Try to remember that.
1208,0,With the attitude that the staff has with their customers I'm not sure how they've been in business this long Their food is good but the times that I have gone there the customer service is pretty horrible to say the least The kid that runs the pick up counter not once not twice but every singe time throws the receipt at me No thank you no smile no nothing Horrible service from the entire staff.
728,1,They have a variety of nice boats that are well maintained and fairly new  Lots of extras available like tubes and wakeboards.
3978,0,Very bad service food so-so DO NOT use a credit card They will tack on more money after you signed and you won't see it until you check your bank statement Only thing good about this place is the mechanical bull.
3884,0,I hope I was just there on an off day Probably the worst italian food I've ever had at a restaurant The ambiance leaves a lot to be desired as well - it kinda feels like the dining room of the rest home my grandfather lived in.

1941,1,"This is a wonderful barre studio  I got hooked on barre at the Village but (at least when I was a member) there were only two classes a week  Karve has several classes a day - enough that there is no excuse for skipping  It also helps that Karve is right next door to Daydreams so someone can watch the little ones for me too Flexible schedule and babysitting - there go my excuses  Every single instructor is wonderful challenging upbeat and professional  The staff here is just incredible They really really know what they are doing AND there is usually at least one other instructor in the class actually taking the class  Got to admit - I like it that the instructors take the classes too and that they also shake and struggle through thigh work  I appreciate that there is a ""formula"" to the class but that even after about 50 classes I have not been bored  And finally I really like the other women that go to Karve  It is a beautiful place to spend an hour."
341,1,I've been eating at The Wild Thaiger at least once a week for the last 3 yearsHands down this is the best thai food I have ever had I have never been dissapointed by anything I've eaten here The staff and owner are always friendly and attentive and the prices are reasonable I would probably eat here every night of the week if I had the chanceAll of the appetizers are delish but the dragon eggs are probably my favorite tasty dumplings with a tangy sauce topped with jalapeno rounds so good Their crab crisps are the best you will ever have My favorite dish of the moment is the Rama of the jungle Delicious melt in your mouth beef skewers with flavorful rice fritters and spicy green papaya salad YUM All of their curries are amazing and so is thier peanut sauce There is honestly nothing here I wouldn't recommend I even like their tofu dishes and normally I won't eat tofu Oh and don't forget dessert awesome cheesecakes and coconut ice cream even a delicious chocolate cake  If you love fresh mouth-watering thai food check this place out I'm sure you will enjoy.
1627,1,Best pizza I've ever hadhands down  It lives up to the hype  In fact I've been now 3 times before writing this review as I wanted to make sure my 'best pizza' claim was true  Each time I've had a different pizza and each time I've walked away wanting more  The crust is amazing and it is cool to watch them make the pizzas  Best time to go is for lunchbut get there early as it fills up quick  The restaurant is small and cozywith a cool bar next door if you are caught with long wait  It isn't often that places live up to the hypebut Pizzeria Bianco exceeds it.
1233,1,Yep One of the best dollar trees in the Phoenix Metro area I have been to the Dollar Tree in Chandler on Via Linda in Scottsdale the one by PV mall and another one in Hancock Plaza in PV/Phoenix This Dollar Tree is by far the cleanest most organized and well kept store The staff is very helpful and friendly and I have never ever had a problem with this location They also seem to have the items I need in stock Their food items are the freshest too.
2962,1,Love this place The 7seas soup is my favorite Soooo good They have one of the best carne asada tacos.
3903,0,I use to love Barrio Café but I got tired of their prices going up and the food quality and service going down so I stopped going there I decided to give Barrio Queen a try tonight - BIG MISTAKE  After being seated and waiting over 15 minutes I finally had to flag the hostess down to say that no one had stopped by to take our order  Waiter came over and said he was story that no one had told him people were seated in his area  I didn't really understand that has there were only 4 other couples in the entire restaurant eating and it wasn't like he couldn't see for himself that someone was waiting He recommended a cheese fondue for an appetizer - cheese was ok but it came with a laughable amount of chip - 6 chips on the plate to be shared Then another long wait and more waiting ---- then the food arrived  Was just ok - nothing really exciting  Most of the tacos I tried had no flavor Half way into the meal I flagged down the waiter to ask for someone to refill our water glasses  He said he'd be right back and then he just disappeared for about 15 minutes  Then when he walked by again I reminded him that we wanted a refill on water - again he said he'd bring the water  So another 1005 minutes went by and he never with the water or a check  I finally got tired of waiting and went to the front of the restaurant to ask someone to find the waiter so that I could get the bill  Never did he apologize for the extremely poor service I paid the bill and left and will NEVER return  As I was leaving I overheard a couple in front of me discussing also what poor service they received.
10,1,I read about Scramble on line so I thought I would go there for brunch and I loved it The Santa Fe eggs Benedict are amazing The staff is friendly and the ambiance is incredible I would highly recommend this place to anyone.

1962,0,I was in Scottsdale for a couple weeks about 2 months ago and decided to come here for dinner with a few coworkers one night what a mistake The service was horrible and slow we had to chase down our server for our check and had to wait about 45 minutes for 1 burger and 3 salads I'm guessing they had to butcher the cow in back or had to wait for the lettuce to grow The place was not that busy so the fact that we had to wait that long for our food is unacceptable not to mention we had to wait up front for the hostess to stop talking to her coworkers at the bar to come seat us The food is way overpriced but in Scottsdale I guess that doesn't matter It looks like a fun place from the outside but beware once you come in.
1006,1,"The best way I can describe the Steele Indian School Park is:""This land once was used as a place where Native Culture came to die and is now being used as a place where Native Culture comes to be revived""I have been to sooo many events at this park The Native American Recognition Day Parade ends here and you can usually see members of different dance groups still dressed in traditional attire laughing and dancing or just catching up With a powwow to follow There are several gourd dances held there Gourd dancing is a very important ceremony where veterans of the military are recognized and thanked for their contribution by their people and are honored justly It's an amazing experience to go Recently the Arizona Indian Festival was held at the park There were traditional villages as well as various dance groups and arts and crafts vendors and of course frybread The festival was a way to take in the different cultures of the many 22 tribes in Arizona On ""normal"" days it's a nice place to just be The land itself has been blessed MANY times and I remember once a medicine man had asked the Creator to have the park serve the people and asked the the land be able to take anything He has in store for it Several years later the two helicopters crashed and landed about 5 yards from where that man once stood Since I know of many groups who came out to rebless the land and I as a Native American see it as the park doing just what was asked It served the people That accident could have taken more lives then the ones taken But instead it landed in the park and the land took it And is even starting to heal It served the people that day As horrible a tragedy as it was it could have been truely devistating Nearly all Natives have a story of the old Indian School in their family And it's actions have caused many reprocussions some natives were taught to hate their culture and traditional languages And to this day refuse to share their knowledge with their families Some had good times and like to sit around and laugh about their experiences climbing the fence to go run around in Phoenix (my auntie has SEVERAL of those stories) In the 1800's and early 1900's it was a tragic place to exist But like I said earlier our culture didn't die We still sing We still dance we still speak our languages We still grow and learn and teach our young ones We as a people still live on."
712,0,Tried this place because of a groupon  Good thing it was at a discount because it was not worth the moneyWhile the location and building are very authentic and unique for the area that is about all this place has going for itI can't give a mexican restaurant a good review when they charge for chips and salsa especially when the salsa is below averageI ordered the smoked chicken enchiladas and was disappointed  First the waitress messed up my order  I clearly said I wanted the beans and rice this is a mexican restaurant right  For some reason my mexican food comes out with grilled seasonal vegetables and black beans  Ummok  I didn't complain bc I didn't want to wait any longer for my food  But this is definitely a first  Overall the enchiladas lacked flavor and the tortillas were hard  I will not return.
4361,0,We just got thrown out of Archie's Deli in Surprise AZ What was our horrific crime Ordering an off-the-menu appetizer one that my husband has ordered there and received at least five times Today the manager refused to do it saying we would put him out of business if he let everyone order to-go food and eat it in the restaurant Everyone who It was mid-afternoon and the place was empty We told him we would happily pay for the forbidden item (half a pound of hot tongue with a slice of challah) as we always did but he blew up and told us to get outWe are clean-cut polite adult customers who typically spend $60 every time we go to Archie's We tip well love the food have a good rapport with the staff and never cause a problem there This was probably our tenth visit to Archie's and that manager has seen us before Thanks to his nasty attitude today we won't be back and that's a shame Archie's has a nice selection of sandwiches great latkes and a wonderful selection of classic deli beverages The sandwiches are big enough to share but we always buy two and take leftovers home It's unfortunate that this manager didn't have the smarts to sell my husband his tongue and bread--even at a markup Now he lost our business $60 every other week adds up Archie's In this economy isn't customer retention importantThink long and hard before you spend your hard earned money and time here We won't make that mistake again.

2043,1,Exceptional food and serviceTook my in-laws to Christopher's to celebrate a retirement and had an even better experience the second visit  The food was perfectly prepared top quality and tasted superb Josh was our server and managed our experience perfectly-- courses landed together drinks never emptied he was great with our 4 year-old and was intimately knowledgeable about the preparation of the options  Couldn't ask for a better dinnerOnly odd thing is that this restaurant is in a high-end strip mall and splits with a small bar  Not bad things necessarily  Just not things one sees often  Then again ZinBurger is also in that mall.

2829,1,Beautiful presentation delicately simple flavors and a superb chef  We ordered one each of the seasonal omakase (which you have to reserve in advance since the ingredients are hand selected by Chef Nubuo and prepared by him only on the nights he is in house) and the regular omakase with wine pairing  First of all I thought I was going to be out by the end of the meal after drinking so much wine and I'm not a huge fan of wine but the pairings really were spectacular  There's also a list of a few thousand wines available if you are so daring to read through the whole thing  I was pleasantly full after the meal which included such dishes as seared octopus over tomato and fresh mozzarella oyster uni shooter (my personal fav) mushroom melange lamb chop etc etc etc Also the last dish of the regular omakase the foie gras was so melty smooth and rich that I almost cried I literally had to hold back the tears from pure culinary ecstasy  The dessert assortment at the end was a nice finish-- banana creme brulee assortment of ice creams green tea custardChef Nubuo is not only creative but incredibly kind and attentive to his customers  Not the typical stuck-up sushi chef  The hostess was a bit snotty since we were sharing omakase meals but we ordered a bunch of a la carte items and drinks as well  The total for four of us still came out to be over $400 so why she was giving us the glare from time to time I have no idea  If the chef is fine with it the hostess should care less  So aside from the annoying hostess all was well in Sea Saw land  It was a truly fantastic experience and one I would recommend you to try but be willing to open your wallet for the pleasure.

1796,1,This place deserves the accolades  As far as I've found it is the best bar in the greater Phoenix area  The huge patio space and limited interior means that it's friendly to both smokers and non-smokers which I think has had a large part in their popularity  It also just seems to attract an interesting crowd and I think that's what really makes it differentEvery bar attracts a specific average of people  Casey Moore's tends to attract those involved in creative fields like theatre film music etc  I don't want to say this means any one thing but it really does make the place more interesting  If you are creatively inclined you are far more likely to meet someone you might actually like as a human being there and that means a lot.
925,1,"While I've been to both Houston's and Bandera multiple times last night was my first visit to Hillstone the umbrella responsible for all of them Let's just say I'll be hard pressed to go anywhere but Hillstone from now on There was a wait so we started on the outdoor patio for a drink The outdoor space is really amazing Cool lights unique furniture and overall a great ambiance I ordered a Maker's Manhattan rocks and the drink was perfectSo often Manhattans are ""over Vermouthed"" this one was the perfect blend and let the Whiskey speak for itselfEven the ice cubes looked cool The restaurant is large spacious and has a cool design It's very Frank Lloyd Wright esque We sat at a booth toward the back of the restaurant near the kitchen and prep bar Service was prompt and friendly as I've come to expect at any Hillstone restaurantAs for the food it was delicious As a table we ordered the Hawaiian rib eye x2 (ridiculous mine was a perfect medium rare and delicious) the French Dip and the Prime rib All meals were well received even the salads were delicious The menu is really similar to Houston's (read: nearly identical) so you know what you're getting intoIt's not cheap but it's absolutely worth it Hillstone is on my list for a return trip ASAP."
1543,1,Garlic knots Need I say more Not only are their pizza and salads amazing but they have the best garlic knots I've ever had Even if you just go in there for dessert it doesn't get much better than the Zeppolis The prices are great - and you can get a single slice of pizza or a whole pizza this place is 10 times better than Domino's Pizza Hut or any other delivery pizza place Get the garlic knots i'm not sure if I forgot to mention it but they're amazing.
1623,1,Ordered the following items: 1 Al Pastor Taco 1 Carne Asada Taco 1 Al Pastor Quesadilla and 1 Carne Asada Burrito Also got the Cochatta drinkAl Pastor items:Great flavor and seasoning on the meat and the addition of grilled pineapple really perked up the dish Food was not greasy or overbearing fatty very very goodCarne Asada: I have eaten Carne Asada at many many restaurants and this was some of the best Smoky flavor but still juicy and not dry I am sure that as the grill seasons over time this Carne Asada will get even betterCochatta: Mixture of ice coffee and Horchata Cuts the acidity of the coffee and adds a nice sweet cinnamon flavor without being overbearing Great DrinkOverall I was impressed with the online ordering system speed of food construction and taste of the food This place has replaced Chipotle and Fillaburtos as our quick Mexican food place of choice.
633,1,Had a wonderful time and it's a great environment The margarita pizza was out of this world and the old fashions were mixed perfectlyI had left my phone there a few hours before closing Our wonderful waiter and an additional waitress (I'm so very sorry I can't remember your names ): ) found it called my sister we drove from Surprise back to Phoenix and they stayed a little late for me to come and pick it upTHE CUSTOMER SERVICE IS AMAZING You both have wonderful hearts.
2716,1,I love Pete's I know I know - you eat outside you have to order tartar sauce and they only take cash I love the food anyway I've gone to Pete's since I was born I love the red sauce that comes with the fish - it has a little bite to it I only wish they would expand north I'm addicted to Pete's.
4320,0,The scheduling woman Annette is extremely rude and unapologetic  When scheduling a time to come in to my home for an appointment they did not provide the 30 minute call ahead they said they would  She then called to reprimand me for not being there and said that I was being irresponsible  I tried to let her know that I did not receive the 30 minute prior phone call even letting me know that the technician was going to be there  She told me I was wrong and refused to believe me  While the technician's service was neutral the scheduling woman was one of the worst customer service experiences I have ever had.
3261,0,Did anyone else see the expose they did on Jiffy Lube on the local California news channel Someone sent me the vid on YouTube I think so if you want to hear about why never to go here check it out The crux of it is they scam a large percentage of their customers Now I'm sure that there was a big crackdown after the viral effect of that news story but I am hard pressed to believe that it doesn't happen at all anymore Changing filters running specialized machines etc are hard to track the concrete effects of and whether they actually did or not Seriously I would only go here and purchase something beyond a simple oil change if I personally knew the employee Otherwise prepare to get way overcharged for work that they said they did but probably didn't It's a crazy mixed up world out there kids.
710,1,Kris is quite honestly one of the most talented and qualified laser instructors in the country  No one has more experience no one is more accommodating and no one can make learning about lasers more fun than her Her state of the art training facility is UNBELIEVABLE Plus the small class sizes allow students to experience more hands on training than other schools that cram 10+ people in one room If you want to begin your career in lasers there is no better choice than Esthetic Advisor Laser Academy.
4547,0,Worst customer service I have ever experienced (only go if your a male) The two women who were working were gossiping about hooking up with men while cutting these two children's hair I told her I wanted a few high lighs to freshen my look for a wedding That I was trying to get my hair healthy so I dont want a bunch The woman was not friendly at all but i figured oh well its Supercuts Once she finished putting highlights in I was spun around and saw she had put tons of right lights in She announced it would be 85 dollars I told her I would not pay That if I wanted a 85 dollar color job I would have gone to my regular salon She told me to go to the sink Rinsed my hair aggressively and told me to leave Refusing to give me a towel and in front of other customers just said ok leave Will never go back Thought I would save a few dollars and get 4-5 high lights before a wedding Ended up spending 160 to get my tye-dyed hair fixed the next morning and missed my best friends wedding rehearsal RUDE salon Just pay 85 and go to a nice salon that will pamper you.
264,1,My first time at a cajun seafood kitchen and let me tell you it was great  I wasn't so sure how the whole experience would go since I don't usually eat fish and I haven't had a lot of experience with cajun food either  But my hesitation quickly slipped away as the ambiance of the restaurant engulfed me  This is a fun placeIt was a busy night and so we had cocktails and appetizers on the patio--great patio  As our table came available we were escorted inside to nice location by the window  (I love tables with a view)  Our waiter was very helpful with the selections explaining in detail which dishes would suit our individual tastes Nice variety of dishes on the menu  My ceasar salad was was as nice complement to the shrimp etouffee and dirty rice  Everything was spiced just right and the favors were just wateringOur waiter checked back on us periodically just enough to keep in touch but not be a bother  He was attentive and concerned that his dinner suggestions met with our approval--they did  He was very good and I wish I could remember his name to give him a proper shout out Needless to say I'll be back next time I'm in Phoenix---Love you Pappadeaux's.
3317,0,"if $20 per person for all-you-can-eat sushi sounds too good to be true then it's probably too good to be true  the 1st red flag should have been AUCE sushi  think about it if you were the owner of the restaurant would you put out 5 star sushi so that people can scarf it all down for $20i guess it's just as much my fault for believing a korean barbecue restaurant would have semi-spectacular sushiwhatever you do don't let the hostess convince you to sit in the little ""black hole"" room with the ""sushi"" sign on the doorway even if you're only going to order the AYCE sushi (which is a mistake in itself)we were left in there for about 15mins to peruse() the menu  we finally checked off a few rolls and were waiting for the waiter to come back and take our order sheet all the while we could see the sushi chef standing there twiddling his thumbs secretly laughing that he was getting paid to do nothing  i finally figured i could just take the slip of paper up to him myself so i did  he seemed a little taken aback but took the paper reluctantly and pretended to start our order  i say that because it seemed to take another 10 or so minutes for them to bring us the 1st role  by then we were so famished that we scarfed it down like a pack of rabid wolves  it tasted ok but i couldn't tell if it was because i was so grateful to have something to eat or if it really tasted greati've heard it said that they purposefully bring you a roll every 1005 minutes so that you won't order more than you can eat (in which the rules state that any left over food will trump the AYCE price of $20 and they reserve the right to change the pricing structure to full price for each roll/nigiri that is not eaten)  fair enough but anyone who's ever eaten at an AYCE joint knows full well that if you eat too slow you will invariably eat about 1/3 of what you would have eaten if you were allowed to eat at your own ""natural"" pace (haha)  so by the time we got  to the 3rd of 5 rolls we ended up choking down the less than stellar 2 remaining rolls in fear of being charged the full price for the whole mealyeah i must admit that it was not such a great idea to order ""fillers"" such as tempura but the batter was like a batter that you would find on a beer battered onions rings at the local BBQ joint  it was thick doughy and tasteless  i guess i'm used to thin light and crispy tempura batter that i've had at other japanese restaurantsif you plan on taking me there for the AYCE sushi and say that you'll pay for me my wife and 1 y/o daughter don't be offended if i decline you'll thank me later b/c i'll have saved you a ton of money."
2605,0,It takes a lot for me to write a review and blast a company like this and to be fair all the negatives come from their Gilbert location the auwatukee location has always been good  I've tried Ariba's several times and have been disappointed every time  In the four of the last five visits I've found the floors sticky and the tables dirty  If they pay this little attention to the cleanliness of the front I'm scared of what I might find in the kitchen  Although I've always found the service to be slow and the waiters inattentive Sunday's (8/5/12) experience was one of the worst I've ever experienced anywhere  I thought I would take some out of town relatives to a good AZ Mexican dinner but once we received our water/Ice tea they were refilled once during our visit and that only after flagging down the waiter  Minor maybe but when the food was delivered to the table one of the meals was missing and I was assured it would be right out  20 minutes later I flagged down the waiter once again and with apologizes was told they would get it right out  Another 20 minutes went by and my guests had all finished their meals before the waiter came by to see if we needed anything else When I told him we still hadn't received the meal and since everyone else was done we no longer wanted the meal and wanted it removed from our bill  Again with apologies he left and finally returned 20 minutes later with the meal removed  Annoyed with the slow service I tried to return the bill with my credit card immediately  I was ignored and waited another 20 minutes for him to return to take my money  Save yourself a lot of aggravation and disappointment and go somewhere else.
807,1,I love this restaurant The lettuce wraps are out of this world  I have tried other versions and P F Changs wins hands down  Yum.
4261,0,I must say Radio Milano was my all time FAVORITE restaurants in phoenix which I never reviewed because everyone already knew how fabulous it was  Logging into today to realize the venue change has left me somewhere between completely inconsolable and totally suicidal  WHY WHY WHYYYYYY would you do that to us LGO  I HATE SUSHI WHYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY.
3417,0,awful food is bad and there is nogood service.
134,1,This place is kind of buried in a dead little strip mall opposite of Joe's Grotto and can be a little less than eye catching from the outside Once inside you can tell it's has been around for a while However I have been here 3 times with my family and every time the Kung-food and the service here has been no less than amazing The older gentleman that runs the place is always accommodating and friendly My boyfriend is allergic to shrimp and they are more than willing to cater to his needs and make substitutions when necessary The quality of food is always consistent each time and is by far the best that I have tasted in Phoenix They generally aren't super packed which is confusing given the quality of the food here although they do have a lot of business on the take out side We generally get the family style meals which include several delicous items The one we usually get includes Wonton soup the Poo Poo Platter (lol) Mongolian beef (which my boyfriend swears by) Sizzling Shrimp House Special Chicken (best chicken ever) Mushu Pork and Peking Fried Rice And they top off every meal with these little banana filled glazed turnover squares Prices are decent all around which is also a plus given the quality of the food I would highly recommend this place to anyone who would like a delicious memorable and authentic Chinese meal.
3950,0,In town on vacation and wanted to get a pedicure with my husband We called 45 minutes in advance and although we made an appointment we were never really told that we could be seen right away When we got to our appointment on time  we asked again and we were told that they could get started right away They had us sit in a chair and ran water However no one started on us The women next to us didn't even have an appointment And when we asked them they said sorry others had an appointment When we explained so did wewe were asked to go to another salon Not we can fix itbut go elsewhere Funny no one inside looked like us so I dare not pull that card but I'll say our business was not welcomed So if you like bait and switch go here But there are tons of other options in Scottsdale No one deserves to be lied to.
4523,0,"The food is mediocre and unfortunately there aren't a lot of options in town Everytime my husband and I go there the service is bad and  the food is majority of the time cold because its been sitting for awhile  I went in this morning and it will for sure be my last time at any good egg I sat at the bar for 20 minutes Four waiters passed by me and  smiled not a ""someone will be with you"" nothing I was about to walk up to who appeared to be a manager (who also passed me a few times)  but I decided to leave because there was already a precedence to having a bad experience It wasn't till I got up and left when a waiter asked if I was ok I snapped because I was starving and pregnant and I feel bad but that place deserves no business of mine I'm done."
736,1,all the way from calihad to have this place oh how i love the food great place icant lie i love there food.

3007,1,"I am in love with OTF It's seriously the best workout you can get in an hour I love how it just flys by It's similar to circuit training but you wear a heart monitor and your heart rate is displayed on a screen It helps to push me a little bit harder so I stay in the ""orange zone"" longer The staff is also super friendly and very responsive I highly recommend checking out Orange Theory Fitness They offer a free trial class as well."
4128,0,We were in route from Phoenix to Tuscon and needed dinner I looked up a few places online and Eva's seemed like a reasonable optionThis restaurant has EVERYTHING it needs to be successful:* A cool atmosphere-- check* a great menu--check* Good drink specials--check checkDespite all of this this was hands down the WORST Mexican dinner I have ever had in my entire life (I eat a ton of Mexican food)First of all the service is terrible  Our waitress did not know what beer was on tap did not know the drink specials or happy hour dinner apps and didn't give us appropriate drink refillsThe food takes the cake for being just plain awful  I ordered tortilla soup and one of the happy hour nachos my husband ordered a combo meal and my cousin ordered a steak rice bowl  After one bite of my soup I was completely done (tasted like it was burnt) my husband and cousin could stomach a little more than me but still felt like the food was sub par at best  I mentioned to the server that I was disappointed with my soup and all she could offer was to take it back to the kitchen (no replacement option or comp ticket) Bottom line: Would I ever eat here again  Nope  Never.
1503,1,Grew up on Mike and Rondas in Flagstaff  Its awesome to have one here where I live now    I cant really tell you about anything there but the Steak Strips with Eggs meal because thats all I ever get  I'm addicted to itI'm a simple guy that doesnt care for the frills just a place to sit a clean table and good service  If you want real food cooked with plenty of love this is your place to eat.
2297,1,Wow Very delicious sandwiches My husband and I agreed their sandwiches are the best we've had in Phoenix so far They are not typical subs at all They are made with very fresh meat cheese and veggies and really mouthwatering Especially I liked the delicious cheese We had a prosciutto sandwich ($899) and black forest sandwich($699) I also loved the honey mustard sauce in my black forest sandwich After eating sandwiches we decided to have some desserts I was totally overwhelmed by the selection of nice looking cakes They had coconut cream mousse chocolate pistachio mousse caramel apple mousse chocolate cup mousse cream horns tiramisu napoleon cannoli etc etc don't they all sound yummy  I finally decided to try something new to me I forgot the name but it's a kind of pudding with fruits and two kinds of creams in rum syrup The lady working there told me it's popular in Vulcan countries My husband had cherry chocolate mousse We were both satisfied with our choices And they are $295 and $395 which I think quite reasonable It's a small place with 5 tables or so and I think family-owned People working there are nice and friendly Thier food is mostly Italian/French style with some East European tasteNext time I want to try their bread or croissantI wish this place was located closer to our home but probably worth driving all the way to get there.
1580,1,"""Kismet: (Islam) the will of Allah - kismat An event (or a course of events) that will inevitably happen in the future - destiny fate"" That's the word that popped into my head after a wonderful evening at Cibo A motley group of friends met up for dinner and left very very happy We met around 7pm at Cibo We were immediately seated at the front of the house next to the bar The bartender was our waiter and he was super friendly and very helpful We decided to each order a pizza so that plates could be passed around and pizzas shared I'm glad that was what the decision was because I tried several different pizzas that night The server was very helpful in selecting the wine that I chose to drink that night He asked me what I liked to drink as far as American standards and suggested great Italian wines He even came to suggest certain pizzas as well as aperitifs I ordered the Bruschetta it was delicious The entire table enjoyed that appetizer Once the main meals arrived we realized that appetizers weren't needed For my meal I ordered the Prosciutto Crudo The dough was well cooked but not too hard that you could take a good chewy/smoky bite out of it There were plenty of toppings and everything was high quality I was amazed At the end of the meal we just HAD to indulge in the crepes I chose the Nutella and chocolate crepeheaven Of course I shared and everyone agreed that the crepe was amazing To finish our dining experience off we indulged in aperitifs of Lemoncello and some kind of yummy chocolate liqueur Of course from start to finish I was happy Our service was spot on the food was FANTASTIC and the drinks were wonderful It was fate that our crew hit that spot right then right there I honestly do not have one complaint one criticism one bad thing to say about Cibo I hope to catch a moment of kismet again."
1664,1,This place is such a great find and so close to my house I can take side streets all the way home:)  I love that it is BYOB Michael and I brought a bottle of wine with us and proceeded to have one the of the best dinners I have had in a long time  We started out with the Calamari Friti which was so tasty  I cannot bring myself to eat the little octopi but Michael has no issues with that and gobbled those little guys up:)  I stick to the fried little rings and I am fine  Then we shared the meatball pizza I was kind of hesitant because I thought it might be whole meatballs on a pizza but it was not and I am still dreaming of this pizza the flavors and the crust were amazing  I cannot wait to come back and try the pasta dishes and the calzones  We ended our dinner with the Tira Misu I think the moment our waitress set the desert down it was gone in 5 minutes  This was such a great dinner and the price cannot be beat including the $500 corking fee the bill totaled $3500  Not Bad.
4464,0,"SO DISAPPOINTED  Stopped in on a Monday night we were one of 5 tables My first impression was the staff could care less if me and my family were in there or not My kids were excited with their ""build your own burger"" so we went in Waitress forgot our appetizer the build your own burger wasnt anything bigger than a McDonalds hamburger (good enough for my kids tho)I ordered a ceasar salad which came with NO DRESSING Waitress only came back to give us the bill No check back no drink refills no ""how is everything""Just another bar on Mill Ave passing the time until Friday and Saturday Keep walking if your looking for a place to eat This might be good for bar hopping just not to eat."
1205,1,I love Frasher's The service has been awesome both times that I went I sat at the bar and Jen served me She's attentive and friendly and knows her stuffThere was a male manager last time we were there which would be last Saturday night He was also exceptionally nice and helpfulThe crab stuffed mushrooms ribs mashed potatoes and corn are all to die for The appearance is fun It's got a divey atmosphere with exceptional food Not to mention I looove drinking wine in dim lighting I love this place.
526,1,I am in love First of all I'm a taco connoisseur & a tequila lover so it wouldn't have taken much to please me However the corona & lime chicken tacos were excellent our server was knowledgeable about tequilas (& able to find something for my hyper-picky best friend to eat) & the margaritas were good enough that my generally thrifty friends ordered 3 eachI agree that it would be helpful to have some sort of primer on tequila for those who are less tequila-inclined but I will definitely be back.

2942,1,"I always turn to yelp when exploring a new place I've never been It was my first time visiting Tempe AZ I thought to myself ""Where is everybody"" Driving around on the road in the middle of the day it was 90 degrees out and there weren't that many people out Then I went into Harlow's for brunch due to yelp recommendations and realized everyone was here LOL But really I think everyone is indoors when it's hot out The food here was phenomenal I had the eggs benedict Perfect taste and perfect portion This is how all eggs benedict should be My boyfriend enjoyed his meal as well (biscuits and gravy)  and the service was great."
1775,1,I found a great Groupon for this salon and decided to give it a try because of the good reviews I found online The receptionist was super nice when I called and booked me for an appointment with Miguel the next day I was greeted right away and Miguel was ready for me as soon as I arrived I don't think I've ever not had to wait for a stylist I showed Miguel a few pictures of what I was wanting and he gave me an awesome cut and style He's a wizard with the clippers I normally walk out of a salon with really big soccer-mom hair and have to wash it and restyle it immediately but I am incredibly happy with what Miguel has done with my hair The product that he used doesn't smell awful like most products and my hair is totally touchable I highly recommend Salon 1219.

3209,0,That's what it'll be I said to myself as I drove the 20 miles down to the Doctors office from NW Phoenix Papa Joe's Fish and 'Cue  I had read the Yelp reviews and had wanted to go for weeks now  So on the way back from sitting for 30 minutes in an MRI tube I stopped at what I was sure was going to be a grand slam  Kind of a rough part of Bethany Home Road but I figured it should be ok and it was don't let it scare you off  Walked in and the place was full of people but no one had any food in front of them and since it was nearly 1 PM I figured everyone is already done with lunch (wrong)  Ordered the brisket sandwich and two sides for around $650 reasonable enough and even comes with a drink  I was order

902,0,I hate this foresaken place To go from one terminal to the other you have to walk for two days and get blisters on the palms of your feet It has the worst set up no trams what so ever the waiting areas are tiny tiny tiny there is no where to sit you see tons of people sitting on the floor Not a lot of places to eat either and the restaurants all serve their beer in plastic cups how classy is that for a $10 beer I can't rate check in or security check thru's because I only experienced a connecting flight but my experience was a 0 star nightmare.
3783,0,Oh Phoenix you did it again  How can you screw up breakfast  Cold eggs congealing on a plate  Yes  Raw yet greasy potatoes that taste like chorizo Yes  Cold limp bacon Yes  Possibly the worst breakfast I have ever had in my life  If you want a bad breakfast I would recommend 5 and diner for a truly horrific experience I would go Joe's Diner all the way.
409,1,"I discovered Rage Cycles after moving back to Phoenix in 2002 from spending a few years in San Francisco I had reverse culture shock and needed badly to revert to what I loved most - bikes With geographic fortune on my side I wandered into the bike shop nearest my home and and was instantly relieved - I had just found my new second home Nearly every 'wrench' I've met there since Day 1 has given me the personal experience I had been searching for since a friend closed his shop before I moved away Admittedly I'm one of those people fanatic enough about bikes that I would share my bed with one and also currently have one of my most prized custom cruisers hanging on my wall as a mechanical piece of art (which I do pull down to ride frequently)and while I'm a very passionate bike owner I am a horrible mechanic - hence my need for Rage So when your garage shed and living room are filled with bikes ranging from grocery-getter cruisers custom built/painted top to bottom rigs downhill mountain and high end top dollar ""all mountain"" bikes AND you know from first hand experience that working on them yourself is the worst possible idea you need a shop like Rage that is filled with guys that not only know their shit but share that same passion I would 100% lay it on the line to vouch for every single person who works there to give you the bike shop experience you needeven if you're buying your first ever bike I heart Rage with good reason."
2378,1,"I had a fabulous experience today Chef Sara was very friendly and super helpful with the menu She did let us know she was out of some ingredients though and so the menu was rather limited This disappointed me at first so I ordered something that would have been probably my 3rd choice I got the ""Rawgasmic"" sandwich and let me tell you I was not disappointed in the least The bread was a amazing and the spreads were so flavorful The sandwich was topped with so many colorful fresh organic veggies too I was completely full and satisfied after eating this My friend ordered the marinara zuchinni noodle bowl and I swear she inhaled it before I could ask for a tasteI also loved the decor and even took some photos around the place to copy in my own decor Yes it is pricier than your average lunch joint but I'd rather pay extra here than at some second rate chain Here I know all the ingredients have a purpose and are all fresh organic and carefully chosen The menu is so creative and the plate ends up looking like a work of art So yeah I'll pay a couple extra dollars for that I wish I had room for dessert because the dessert tray looked incredible."
4,1,The sushi is amazing  It is made daily in the store by an authentic sushi chef  The rolls are more beautiful and delictable than in most actual sushi restaurants  Pricing is good too 12 piece brown rice spicy tuna for $799 beats most happy hour pricing and the really fancy rolls are typically $8-$10  The produce selection is broad as well including an all organic sectionThey also match competitor coupons  I use the $3 of off $30 from Fresh and Easy when I go thereThey also have good prices on wine (larger selection than some wine stores).
4214,0,So where do I start There was a long line to get in so the foods has got to be good Only problem is that I never made it inside to eat My friend and I arrived and it wasn't what i had expected I thought it would be a local neighborhood bar with good food It's not it's a tinie tiny diner that looked kind of dumpy We walked in and added our names to the long list We tried waiting inside but the ogling from the sex predator cook made it strange and we had to sit outside After waiting for 10 min the hostess came out and was looking for a party that had already left due to the wait she called their name and when there wasn't a response she just grabbed a couple that had just arrived What  This place is crap We were waiting We ended up leaving and going to Liberty Market now that place is great Sorry I hate leaving bad reviews but it was a terrible experience.

3169,0,We ordered a smoothie waited patiently for 20 min We were the only ones who ordered 3 couples came in ordered after us but got their drinks before we did Naturally after seeing other pple get their drinks before us I asked if they were still making our smoothieThis guy must've been having a bad day Right away he started yelling at us Making excuses his juice machine was broken I needed to calm down etc I said ok 5 min later he asked us what we ordered We told him turns out he gave the drink to the wrong customer Instead of just re making the drink he started yelling saying we weren't paying attention giving him and his employee attitude He just gave us our money back and yelled at us to get out The other customers left too after seeing his response Extremely unprofessional rude and just plain disgusting attitude Was an african american employee claimed he was the ownerLol we just wanted a smoothie he accidentally gave away our drink blamed his machine made us wait 25 min just to kick us out cause he was too embarassed to apologize We were extremely confused Maybe the juice is good idk we never got to try cause the employee made a mistake ans then kicked us out because he was too embarassed to apologize.
1129,1,"Willow Stream Spa in the Scottsdale Fairmont Princess is my all-time favorite spaI suppose for that to matter it requires some context And yes I've been to more than a few spas That's because (1) I love spas and (2) I've been lucky enough to be a magazine travel writer and editor of health and spa magazines for years So I have spa'd in and out of the country and on most cruise lines I've done day spas and ""stay"" spas I've been to Japanese spas a Thai spa in Canada the ultimate Ayurveda spa in Fairfield Iowa  and my most recent massage was at Halele'a Spa in the St Regis Princeville on Kauai which Conde Nast just named a top spa for 2010 So I don't name my favorite spa lightly We moved to Scottsdale less than two years ago and I love everything about it But beyond the weather and great dining and outdoor hot spots it is absolutely spa heavenWhen we bought a house down the street from the Fairmont last year I was sure that their spa was too expensive for regular visits despite being just a lovely stroll away But I've averaged well over a visit a month between gift certificates from friends spa weeks and the spa's own specialsOthers have detailed the great features so I won't belabor that my favorites are the wet room the inhalation room and the rooftop pool with free cabanas What a beautiful place to enjoy an Arizona sunset The amenities are all truly free and unlimited It's always a half-day experience for me A full vacation right down the roadSpa week can be way too crowded This year I tried a Saturday evening and I'll never do that again But it is spa week that made me a regular so I can't complain about others discovering this great value I'll just be sure and do weekdays only I've never had a bad massage here My spa week sessions have never skimped on quality I don't know how those wonderful therapists do it I have had a couple of very irritating moments with the front desk at the spa So much so that my cursor hovered over the stars considering removing one So it wasn't minorBut I booked my next appointment this morning and had a wonderful person on the phone so hopefully this one dark smudge is being addressed."
634,1,Taliesin West represents perhaps the best tour I've been on in my life  Dwayne the guide was animated passionate informative and gave us more than 90 minutes of facts stories and intrigue about FLW and the amazing space the Taliesin West representsBased on my experience I could not recommend anything but the 90 minute tour  If you've driven our there pay the extra few dollars (which supports good work philosophy and learning) and indulge your mindThey feature several discounts for the 60 and 90 minutes tours including those for seniors and active militaryBe forewarned a large portion of the tour features the outside elements and on a cold and rainy day it can be a bit of a burden without proper clothes and an umbrella  Even moving inside can be a challenge due to FLW's insistence on using canvas sheets for the roof  Kick ass stuff.
3372,0,"What is it with AZ and their TERRIBLE chinese  I'm from small town midwest and our chinese was amazing  This is a big city- wtf  Anyways Oriental Garden ""super"" buffet was anything but super  I know that buffets in general are hard to rate becuase of the lacking food quality but I've had some great chinese buffets in my day  The options are limited and they didn't even have the favorites like sesame chicken general tso or beef and broccoli  Instead they replaced it with weird questionable entrees like cheese covered seafood mystery  Even the crab legs were bad and had a funky taste  I wouldn't pay $5 for this buffet so the $13 a person is unresonable for the quality of food  I'm sorry I can't think of any prosWill someone please tell where I can find good chinese food in this city."
1808,1,Had another amazing meal here Some more recommendations include the Gulf Crab Dippair it with the Pinot Grigioand you have perfection Also my husband ordered the Cajun Prime Rib which I had a few tastes ofdeliciouseven nicer if you order it with the Shrimp My main meal and the dessert were the same as last timeand I think if it is possible the Rhubarb and Strawberry Cobler has managed to improve and taste even better than the last time.
4924,0,I have only been here twice but both times were not so fun  The first time was for a birthday party that included 45 guests  Now I'm not accustomed to great or even good service when there are that many people to take care of  Having worked in the restaurant industry myself I can understand the trials and tribulations that come from 45 drunken 20 somethingsHowever I do take note when 4/5 of the bills are taken care of 1 hour before the other 1/5 such that the majority of the party can move on to the next location long before the bills are received by the rest of the party  Not to mention the fact that the server was not able to then clarify the bills such that it took them FOUR attempts to get the last few bills correct attitude included  Again I thought nothing of this at first  So I went back with just the bf  The second time I went to Marcella's the server forgot to offer bread asked what we wanted to drink and never brought them and even took 30 minutes to ask us what we wanted to eat when the place was not even remotely full  Needless to say I had to fill out a comment card   I understand this is a newer restaurant in the newer area of fashion square but I'd like to think that service would be a company's first priority when opening a new restaurant  At least for me personally if the service is great I'm more likely to attribute poor food to the specific meal I picked rather than the restaurant as a whole  To end on a positive note I've heard great things about their prices for happy hour.
2421,0,"Having been a long time customer of Bloom North the Green House and Sauce I have never been disappointed with any of the Fox Restaurant Concepts establishments  The quality and taste of their food is by far among the best in the Valley  That is until Saturday night  We made reservations at Olive & Ivy via OpenTablecom  We arrived promptly were seated promptly and were looking forward to a spectacular meal pared with a few bottles of wine from their typically spectacular selection  That is where our evening went horribly awry  The service was dreadful at best  We placed our order for appetizers and drinks I asked the server about a particular wine he didn't know much about it and offered to bring me a sample  20 minutes later having not seen our server or our drinks we flagged down the manager  This should've been his 1st clue that there were a number of tables in our area that were completely dissatisfied  Our drinks arrived and the server quickly left  Needless to say one drink was completely wrong and had to be sent back and my ""taste"" was a full glass (and I must say wasn't a ""great"" wine and I wouldn't have ordered it if given a choice)  We got our appetizers before getting all of our drink order and then we never saw our server again  Since we never saw our server again we decided that if we're going to drop $400 on a meal that it wouldn't be here  After flagging down somebody we asked for our check which of course was wrong  This is where the restaurant saved some face Our new server (not sure what happened to our 1st server) sincerely apologized for what had been going on and agreed to take off the ""taste"" that I was being charged $14 for (I only took a sip of it so the glass was still full)  When she came back she said that the manager comped the entire check since things had gone so far south on the patio  We did leave her a nice tip and I hope she got it and not the server who ruined our eveningWe decided that we needed a nice retreat from bad service so we went over to TCooks at the Royal Palms Inn (highly recommended) and we dropped $400+ there on food and wine  It's too bad with such good food and wine our topic of conversation was our earlier bad experienceI hope this isn't a cultural shift for Fox Restaurant Concepts (Bloom North the Green House Sauce and many more)  I would hate to think of Bloom treating me this way  And I just can't imagine how this could happen at this location considering the parent organization (Fox Restaurant Concepts) is located in the same building."
729,1,Great service Packed my goods and arrived on time on perfect condition  Very happy with Joe Demarco and the UPS Store.
228,1,Amazing exhibits and live performances  We went during a christmas piano performance and it was incredible  They also had a show with the musical machine from belgium in the mechanical music section  It was amazing to see who they created old time music boxes and paper based music machines.
2458,1,"We go here every year during our annual jaunt to Glendale Glitters It's owned by a very friendly Polish family that always make me smile One year one of the daughters had a fake baby and must have been ""playing mommy"" for a school class It kept crying and the whole family kept taking turns rocking and feeding the baby while acting like nothing unusual was going on I told you that make me smile Every time I go there I am sure to get the pierogi as it's not to be missed But please don't go there during Glendale Glitters because it's so hard to get a table during the festivites and I really want to get a seat this time."
2589,1,I love this place  The pizzas are great but their salads are my favorite  I love the antipasto salad with their house made dressing  I have eaten here more times than I can count and will keep coming back for more.
493,0,I'm giving this place 1 star because I went to get my hair colored for the first time and the girl messed up on it so I had to go back the next day and get it bleached and colored again The color didn't exactly come out the way I wanted it too but it will do I'm just upset because after all that now I'll have to keep up with it so it don't turn orange and most likely I'll just have to cut my hair short to get the color out since it won't go back to my natural color after bleaching I'm so upset that my husband paid 150 for this.
1616,1,The only thing I can say about this place is the bean dip is good hot food tons of flavor and excellent service I always sit at the bar.
4774,0,"Buzz kill  It was 3p and there was only 4 varieties all of which were basic and underwhelming  Thinking they were closing soon I asked what their hours where  After commenting on the sparse assortment and finding out there is no cooking on site the clerk said ""there might be more coming from another store""  I also inquired about the ingredients wanting to know more about the quality of ingredients used  The gal replied with ""she didn't' know"" since she didn't cook them  Give me a break  Product knowledge especially when it comes to food is standard  Most bakeries are known for something using organic ingredients having a signature cake ect  I ended up with chocolate  At 350 a pop it had way too much frosting  cake was dry could be compared to a Safeway bakery cupcake just more presentable  I'll take a sprinkles cupcake any day where at least you know your getting top of the line ingredients and almost always have a great selection of flavors."
1089,0,Totally disappointed I wasn't paying attention when I pulled into the parking lot and I thought I was going to Whataburger Imagine my surprise when all I saw was hotdogs on the menu Took me a minute to figure out why but once I did since I was there I thought I'd try something Having never been to a Wienerschnitzel before I had to rely on the photos to show me what to expect Saw the sauerkraut dog and had to order that has mustard too perfect way to eat a hot dog Shakes were on sale so i got a chocolate one The shake was ok it didn't make it back to the office but not because it was 'awesome' it was because I was thirsty and that's all I had Got to the office opened the bag pulled out the hotdog and well was quite disappointed The photo shows a HOTDOG in a bun with a nice stripe of mustard and a heaping amount of sauerkraut That is not what I got I got a hotdog in a BUN with about a teaspoon of sauerkraut that looked like it was dipped in mustard Ok so i'm used to the Costco hotdogs where you can actually see the dog sticking out each side so i was expecting as such That's how the photo looked but no no dog sticking out took me two bites each end to find the hot dog and it was no bigger around than my finger and was tasteless Won't go there again.
1092,1,I am a Sephora Insider because I frequent Sephora all the time I recently had my free makeover done by Heather and Yvette at Sephora They did a fabulous job It was so great I don't usually like when people do my makeup since I am really fussy They listened to exactly what I wanted and made me look flawless I recommend getting all your beauty needs at Sephora.
78,1,My son and daughter both get thier hair cut here and they always do an excellent job I keep going back.
2885,1,If you judge a BBQ place by the smell when you walk in the door this place will get your attention right away  It smells like any authentic down home BBQ joint you have ever been in  Before you are even greeted by the friendly staff it's a good sign  The menu is great diverse and everything looks great  I had the Cuban sandwich which had pulled pork mustard and pickles with a side of jalapeno Cole Slaw  It was exceptional  Other favorites at the table were the baby back ribs  The meat was falling off the bone but not overdone  The appetizer was the potato chips with ranch dressing  If you love chips this is the perfect dish  The worst thing about the appetizer will be stepping on the scales tomorrow morning :)  Well worth the extra pound it added to my waistline though :)The BBQ sauces were the best Madison our server was great atmosphere was great and the food overall was better than expected  They also do the little things right like have Stevia in the raw not a huge thing but very noticeable in terms or doing it right I would recommend this place to anyone who loves BBQ or wants to try something different  We will go back for sure.
1069,1,We've been to many Indian food spots in the past but this is by far our favorite The food is always on point and we are always greeted with a smile.
4290,0,My boyfriend and I were in the area wanted to try something new scoped it out on YELP Thought it would be good because the reviews were good Only one menu off to the side in the whole place One girl was working no greeting went up and asked her about a menu item and could have cared less She didn't ask if it was our first time or try to help in any way was tossing things around must have hated her job Could barely hear her when asking the type of bean or rice we wanted Absolutely would not come here again The impression from just the employee not having any sort of customer service skills was enough for me to not want to come back The food was decent had a salad and nothing to write home about You can just go to Chipotle and get the customer service and good food.
85,0,Both Market Bistro locations are now out of business.
2066,1,This place is so delicious It's such a chill environment dress up or don't it's totally up to you And the food Well it's delicious south-Mexico style food You must try The Español for an appetizer but you can never go wrong with the guacamole either And the paella is just delicious but be prepared for left-overs Oh and don't forget the drinks Bloody Michelada or a Margarita both are great.
4255,0,Does not exist at this location.
3364,0,Our pizza was totally raw  Completely disgusting and totally un-edible  I would give 0 stars if I could.
3494,0,Their website says they can bring any flavor to an event Apparently they can do that but not professionalism I put a request for a small order to set up for my family for Christmas time Since I'm not there I obviously can't cook anything so I always set up a catered dinner that they just need to go pick up I asked if it was possible and they said I was a joke and to go to Fry's As a business owner myself no matter what the request is you should respond in a kind and professional manner I encourage people interested in this business to try other caterers before this one.
2665,1,Is there anywhere else in the Valley that does bruschetta this yummy I think not Love their catering too.
4697,0,I visited the Sugar Bowl this weekend and really wanted to love it I was so excited to sample their delicious treats However before I could even raise the spoon to my mouth I discovered not one not two but three roaches roaming around the restaurant Gross I will not be returning.
4283,0,IHOP is barely a step up from Denny's in terms of boring chain food Last night was the first time I ever had dinner there and it tasted like squishy mushy cardboard The food took forever even though there were only three tables in the place with customersThe reason I gave it two stars instead of you is because the breakfasts are pretty good I don't mind them except the omlettes which are way too oily The coffee is almost bad but the waitresses always look happy[update April 2 2011]Why'd I go back I hate this place now We went today for the first time we have all had a chance to go out together for breakfast I was excited to do this and was eager I should've stayed homeMy wife got a waffle with her combo that was cold tasted like cardboard and was crunchy The bacon my wife and child ordered was burnt crispy and did not look like bacon at allMy sausage (I always upgrade to turkey sausage since the regular pork kid here is vomit worth) was totally cold I sent it back and complained I think she microwaved my plate Their coffee is always burnt so I got an iced coffee She said they had Mocha Vanilla or Hazelnut I asked if they just had a regular coffee flavored one she said yes and brought me disgusting hazelnut (glad I'm not allergic)Ok now it's three hours later My daughter laid on the floor whining about how bad her stomach hurts I've been to the bathroom twice and my wife is asleep because she said if she didn't lay down she would puke SeriouslyThe management (district managers) really need to care enough to read YELP  They remodeled the outside of this place and I guess spent all their money to make it look pretty so we'd forget they serve dogfood.
1047,1,Years ago I had a Jack Russel who was very 'alph'  Brad worked with us and my Jack Russel became a happy obedient dog  Brad was never harsh or mean and our dog responded beautifully  I had vets comment on what a well behave Jack Russel he was  I now have a wonder chihuahua who is sweet but stubborn  Brad and Jade are great my puppy is already responding  I love this group and the philosophy  It is more price they 'puppy mill' trainers but sooo very worth it.
760,1,The live events are excellent so verify they have something playing when you visit  You can spend days in this museum if you love music so be prepared   try to catch the apollonia music show that happens everyday   The museum restaurant was also really impressive  We had a chestnut soup that was spectacular.
2095,1,"This place is the SH*T Alex the owner is cool as hell Real kick back shop and real professional I've had the same Berber for 5+ years but I moved north and the drive was killing me I gave ""The Spot"" a shot and homeboy delivered Great cut hot towel AND a shoulder massage (no homo) for $12 Even his little bald friend cut really good Hey if u live in the area and need a good fade or whatever then check this place out It's definitely worth it."
1552,1,If there is ever any place to be for dinner this is it Sometimes I find myself dreaming of brie and steak tenderloins on thoes little toasts Great beer and wine selection Can be hard to get there for happy hours because it's packed The service 4 stars Highly recommended :).
2181,1,This place is a hidden gem  You cannot get live honky tonk music like this anywhere close  Did I say LIVE music yes I did We went there on a Saturday night I guess the weekend it opened It is next to the Scottsdale Comedy Club which by the way if you have not tried must go The place is small but they had a full bar nice décor and great service  So it won me over  Must try the Texas Frito Nachos  so good  the hush puppies lack flavor but I'm not a fan of hush puppies in general My companions liked them then again if you're drunk anything fried is good  They have a small dance floor in front of the stage so bring your cowboy boots and start two-steppin  The only criticism I can make is the place is small and it would have been nice if there was a patio to get away for some air  I'd go back to enjoy the live music drinks and try out their menu which is quite good in price.
2877,1,This is by far the best yogurt place I have ever been to I am a yogurt snob and I am glad that I ran across this place The first thing I notice is that the owners keep pride in making the place spotless Secondly the workers are very friendly (couple cute ones) and always willing to give you a sample cup I recommend trying a couple sample cups to see what you will like The flavors are awesome and some are switched out every so often Some yogurt places have a weird chemical taste to it This place does not have that taste at all The price is also by far one of the most competitive in yogurt industry Yummy tummy.
1068,1,Loved this place  It was great to get seated in back by the yard but still inside  ordered about 5 plates and loved everything  get the crab in the jar it is basically a cup a butter with crab in itwaiter was great and it was really cool to have three different places inside one location/.
4265,0,I've gone to this salon several times an usually only as my second or third choice This past visit will definitely be the last I made an appointment for the first available (once they opened) for a mani/pedi for myself and two pedis for my sisters We walk in for our appointment and there are only two people working and they already had 4 people in the chairs doing pedis Then they state that they only had us marked down for the mani/pedi and didn't have the pedis marked for an appointment Regardless I made the first appointment of the day we show up 5 minutes early but they are already working on four other people What's the point of even making an appointment if they won't honor it and hold your spot Then the technician that did my nails was extremely opinionated and would constantly insult and talk me out of what I wanted I went in to get my nails done for my wedding and had a wry specific idea in mind However did not leave with what I wanted Very disappointed Plus both my sisters pedis were done poorly and are already peeling not even 12 hours later.

2624,1,Stumbled across Zoes on our way out of town we're touring musicians so fresh fast inexpensive food is super important to us on the road We got excited as soon as we walked in the door You could smell the freshnessWe had a hard time deciding but I had the spinach wrap with chicken and Greg had the turkey reuben Both were fabulous and the fresh slaw with feta side was fantastic as well We so wish we had a place like this at home.
663,1,I am new to Arizona and I absolutely love Sprouts Having a place like that makes the transition of moving to Mesa AZ from Seattle WA a lot easier for me.
2179,1,Overall experience couldn't have been any better so I have to give a whopping 5 stars After a sad morning at the vet I decided to treat myself to some nearby coffee Heard a lot about this place especially how incredibly awesome the staff is at this location so we had to check it out Low and behold the truth has been told This visit actually turned my day completely around We pulled up and this super cool peppy chick came running (yes she literally ran back and forth to take orders and give them) out to greet us at the car while we were waiting in one of the drive-thru lines and gave us the rundown on the menu since we were newbies She talked us through our order we waited a few minutes and then pulled up to the window or should I say PARTY (I encourage you to take a solid look inside the shack if you have a chanceThey have a friggin' DISCO BALL inside for goodness sake) There was a really chill funny gal ready to take my money She actually had the ability to hold a good conversation while we waited for our drinks (there were none of those boring lulls or awkward glances where you accidentally make eye contact before your food is ready) And she even gave my pup a doggie treat OH Annnnnd gave us a punch card but punched all of the spots so that we would get a free drink next time Can't wait to go back I seriously left wanting to get a part-time job there just so I could become friends with the workers and have them in my life Haha You guys rockAnd the iced drinks were OH SO DELICIOUS Try the Annihilator You won't regret it.
4110,0,walked in got seated the table was still dirty/oily/sticky Smelled like a mixture of cleaning products and old fish My daughter was getting ill due to the smell so we left Didnt order and never will We were really looking forward to a good bowl of pho It was disappointing.

3288,0,I have 3 words for you: FAKE BOARDING PASSESIn 2009 we tried to fly to Costa Rica from Toronto at Christmas time BIG MISTAKE To make a long story short our flight out of YYZ was delayed by 3 hours (even though it was showing on-time on the website when left our house we were later told by American Airlines that apparently the flight crew was late) and we spent 3 days alternately standing in line-ups or sitting from morning until night in various airports on stand-by for flights because we couldn't make our connection We were passed around from one enormous line-up to another (only to be sent back again) and got sent all over the USA We went from Toronto to Charlotte to Dallas to Florida and finally to San Jose Costa Rica receiving some bogus boarding passes in the process Boarding passes that they took from us and refused to give back This part involved US Airways' partner American Airlines (the AA representative told us that the flight had been oversold weeks ago and there were other passengers already in the seats we had showing on our boarding passes) and some unfriendly back and forth between the two And of course you dare not make a scene in an American airport no sirree bob otherwise those GI Joes will be all over you like white on rice We were all ready to explode especially after the second day when our luggage managed to get on a flight but we didn't so we were at the motel with only the clothes on our backs Motel folk were really nice though and they gave a discount to stranded travellers We missed out on a 3rd of our 9 day trip (all pre-paid) and were not compensated 1 penny by US Airways or GAP Adventures All the gory details took 3 single-spaced pages to spell out but suffice it to say avoid US Airways and avoid traveling during Christmas if you can.
2317,1,I love this place awesome food great beer/wine selection A really relaxed atmosphere Thursdays they have 75 ice scream scoops and they're kid friendly Generous pour when you order a glass of wine always a good thing in my bookJenna and Brooklyn are the only two that have served us and both and fantastic.
3379,0,"I hate to break it to you all but the long awaiting delivery of an H&M store in Scottsdale turned out to be a huge disappointment Ever hear the saying ""Good from far but far from good""  This pretty much sums it up The clothes are great for a straight figured person with no curves that only wants to wear their cloths once or twice Otherwise you are SOL  There is no quality control whatsoever except that they are all made cheaply  The only thing good I can say about H&M is the have cute accessories."
120,1,Always enjoy the food here especially the brisket cornbread and Mac n cheese Our servers were excellent from the minute we walked into the establishment to the time we headed out.
1607,0,"So disappointed  I used to love BJs restaurant  Their food is no longer the great delicious quality that it used to be  It was as if they received frozen prepared food in a box microwaved it and served it  Everything we ordered tasted stale or like a cheap thawed out frozen dinner  Our waiter offered no resolution whatsoever and had a ""so sad too bad"" attitude stating that corporate changed some of their recipes and they had no control over it  He also charged us full price for everything even though we ordered happy hour specials We had to remind him that it was happy hour  Never going back."
649,0,"Cockroaches and poor service confirmed it was the last time I went there I loved this place The crispy chicken lunch was one of my favorite dishes around But then everything changed on Monday 09/30 I'll give you my chain of events that has me adding this place on to my blacklisted restaurants list:I ordered the usual crispy chicken and paid to go 10 minutes later the hostess comes up and says ""Sorry we dont have that dish you have to pick something else"" I scanned the menu again and went with the BBQ pork dish which is the same priceAnother 10 minutes go by and I still havent seen my order What I did see was a giant cockroach on the white faux alligator-skinned  booth seating It started scrambling around and my coworker knocked it to the ground while it was chasing him I immediately inform the hostess of the situation while pointing to the cockroach she smiles and says ""oh we just sprayed this morning"" and walks away without clearing the cockroach 37 minutes after walking in through the door we get our order without an apology for the entire experience 37 minutes after walking in the door I decided I would never step foot in this awful place again The icing on the cake for me was that the BBQ pork was awful and undercookedStay away."
2019,1,I had the unique opportunity to witness one of Anthony's Brush Parties for kids Such a wonderful concept to watch the kids experience art in a whole new level and have so much fun in the process Anyone with children should definitely consider this as a great option for a birthday partyand if you don't have children scoot on down for an adult party I will gbe coming back for one of those very soon :).

377,1,Great food  this location is inside of a shell station (Circle K products) The popeyes employees don't care if you get a drink from the Circle K side (as long as you order chicken  duh) Great for lunch or dinner And on tuesdays they have the $1 special.

1567,1,So there is this amazing pizza place called Pizza Press outside of Disneyland It is one of my must haves when I visit Imagine my joy when I walked into Fired Pie with the same concept and deliciousness but without the almost 400 mile driveThe toppings are fresh and choices are plentiful so even the picky eater can find something The reg tomato pizza sauce isnt spicy and it isn't sweet ( if I want sweet I will buy dessert) The only thing is to tell them is to not over cook the pizza cuz it can easily get charred If you arent a pizza person or need more than just pizza the salads aren't to be missed I ordered just a plain ceasar salad and it was awesome  The lettuce was crisp and fresh They didn't overpower it with either cheese or dressing It wasn't premade and dumped in a bowl or packaging to just serve up Another plus is that it is definitely big enough to share if you are with someone and you are each having a pizzaAll said and done this is a place that I hope stays in the neighborhood for years to come.
1086,0,"Here's a tip don't eat here The food was bland and cold The cheese in the cheese enchilada wasn't even melted It was a tortilla full of cold shredded cheese Also the refried beans were awful -- I've had instant refried beans that held their consistency betterWe waited 20 minutes for this ""food"" and there were only three other occupied tablesAlso this is the only place I've ever been to that when you order ""chips and salsa"" puts the salsa ON the chips If you can call it salsa -- chopped tomato and onion with cilantro barely even qualifies as Pico de gallo it sure as hell isn't salsa But thanks for making my chips soggyThis is the first Filiberto's I've been to I'll try another just to rule out one pathetic location But I'm never going back to this one."
4674,0,"Worst Customer Service EverMy husband (G) went to this center today to get some screws for a microwave we were given after striking out at Ace Home Depot etc G told the ""Customer Service Rep"" what he needed and after searching his computer a bit he declared that he wasn't able to help G WITH ATTITUDE - like G was putting him out by asking him to do his jobG asked to speak to the manager in the hopes that he might be able to get some actual help and was told that no he wouldn't get the manager for G because G had an attitude and needed to leave the store Keep in mind that my husband hadn't said anything rude or raised his voice He had simply asked to speak with a manager G was floored what had he done to deserve this After he left the center he called and unfortunately got the same rude employee Employee said he still wouldn't get a manager but eventually gave in after declaring that the manager probably would refuse to talk to G The manager did come on the line and when G explained what had happened the Manager (THE MANAGER) told G that it is a store policy that if an employee determines that a customer is out of line rude etc that they have sole authority to have them removed from the premises What kind of BS is this Apparently at Sears Parts & Repair the customer is always WRONG It is amazing to me that after all the money we have dropped in Sears that not only did this kind of disrespectful thing happen but that the Manager actually claims this is ok and store policy Really Store policyI will be writing a formal complaint to Sears Corp and see what they think of this ridiculous ""store policy""."
2641,0,If I could give it less than 1 star I would  I don't understand all the people raving about this place the food is horrible They must be friends or getting paid for their reviews Every roll is a really bad California roll with Krab meat and horrible to mediocre toppings on top I ordered a spicy tuna role since it's pretty hard to mess up wow was I wrong The roll was the nasty California role with chopped tuna on top and there was  absolutely no spice to the role I was told by the waitress 'that's how we make our spicy roles' This confused me  since the definition of spicy is ' seasoned with or containing spice'  so their spicy roles are not really spicy roles  I will give them this the roles are big and inexpensive but who cares when they are basically inedible .
2123,1,Great service  Great atmosphere  Did not eat so can't comment on that.
4540,0,Well this is not new york pizza and obviously no one here has ever had NY pizza  Sauce bland crust was wrong and cheese had an odd flavor  Don't say its new york pizza if its not  Just another sub-standard pizza place trying to make a buck off the new york name.
4098,0,I travel frequently Ive stayed at many 4-5 stars so i know what to expect when it comes to service This hotel lacks customer service professionalism organization and the ability to meet the paying customers needs For this I rate them a 1 star They completely screwed up my reservations (i had multiple rooms reserved) pretty funny they claimed they didnt have accurate billing set up yet charged my account fees The reservation desk and front desk deserve an F- minus all around Please save your time money and frustration and book elsewhere.
4982,0,"Let me start off by saying I had the worst service I have ever had in my life at the Barrio Our server was SO rude I went here with a friend of mine and we were completely blown away by our experience This was my first time dining at Barrio Cafe and my very last We ordered the table side guacamole and it wasn't ""table side"" our server made it in back and just threw it down on the table I ordered the fish taco's and my friend ordered the quesadilla  My fish tacos tasted like I was eating fish sticks wrapped in a stale tortilla SO GROSS My friends Quesadilla  was so bland how do you mess up a quesadilla  So to say the least Barrio Cafe is forever marked off my places to dine at in the city."
4520,0,Mediocre sushi and god-awful service My wife and I both ex-servers from our college years tried them three times Every time the service was infuriating and the food bland Save your money.
2672,1,This place is very coolAfter having dinner at Humble Pie and seeing all the hype going on over at this little joint I knew I had to check it out Grabbed lunch with my intern here mid afternoon on a Friday It's an entirely remodeled home turned into a restaurant Go inside and you can see where the lviing room with fireplace used to be and the kitchen area too All redone to be intimate seating and a very quaint but stocked bar area Even the bathroom looks old school like they just moved in and the prior residents were just there It's pretty coolWe sat on the patio which had a ton of great seating Couches for hanging and drinking probably to a little 3 chair bar area and plenty of patio tables with a great umbrella in the middle Also to the side is this super funky old tractor contraption that now is a glorious fountain resting on a mountain of giant rocks It's very cool So out of place but I dug itThe wait service was fantastic She wasn't pushy but attentive too We orded the baby blue and the BLT The baby blue had the sweetest chewiest walnuts ever and what looked like perfect amount of blue cheese too Apple slices wer cut super thin and drizzled with a yummy dressing I had the BLT which came with a chipolte mayo saice and avacado Yeah that's right The bacon was cooked to be extra crunchy and served on the best locally grown lettuce and tomatos They give you kettle chips and a pickle spear Hands down that damn pickle was stellarCan't wait to go back on a Sunday or Monday for an all day happy hour.
2388,1,Love this place so much as they have the best Pho Bo Kho (beef stew) Always comes for more I always like to see their small water fountain that they had in the middle of the restaurant Their service is very fast and the food taste great I'm pretty sure I'll be back for more Pho Bo Kho.
4407,0,We came here to celebrate my brother and my husband's birthdays  We will never pick this place again  The service was SO slow and the food was mediocre at best  We only had 1 red crunched pepper between 9 people  The jar was passed back and forth throughout the dinnerSupremo Italiano - It was only thing good from this dinner but not the BEST pizza   (spicy Italian sausage pepperoni bell peppers onions mozzarella provolone and meat sauce)Chicken & Sausage Ziti - This dish was so watered down  Tasteless  HORRIBLE  (chicken breast mild Italian sausage red onions roma tomatoes and spinach in garlic cream sauce)Linguine Frutti di Mare - This dish was ok  (shrimp baby clams mussels and calamari in spicy red clam sauce)Spaghetti with Meatballs - This was another tasteless dish  The meatballs was horrific  The meat was low grade and after eating it I lost my appetite  I don't think it was meat at all  YUCKWe waited 45 mins for tasteless dishes   And spend a couple hundred of dollars.
200,1,I was invited to my cousins wedding at this lovely location The resort itself is absolutely stunning The grounds are very well kept and the staff is very friendly and helpfulThe wedding was held on the golf course and made for an amazing view of the mountains and sunset (which was perfect for this 530 wedding) The area where the reception took place was right below the main restaurant/bar for the resort the area provided was small but perfect for the amount of people attending (they may have a separate location for bigger parties) there was plenty of room on the dance floor for us to all get-down and boogie The resort also catered the food and I must say I was very impressed AS the guests of the party entered the reception area we were greeted with smiles by two young ladies serving finger foods as appetizers There was a try of baby bruschetta and crape wrapped asparagus sprinkled with asiago cheese Both were very good but I must say to the restaurant manager if this asparagus isn't on your normal menu it should be and ASAP They were Delicious and everyone really enjoyed them For dinner we had the option of a steak which came with a side of mashed potatoes and asparagus or salmon that came with a side of rice pilaf and asparagus I was lucky enough to try both options and personally i would always pick salmon of steak but this time around I enjoyed the steak much more My steak was cooked just perfectly but i did hear other guests say there's was a little rare for their liking (I didn't mind it at all) although I didn't have took much connection with much of the staff the ones that were working this party we all extremely nice and helpful all in all i would defiantly recommend this location to throw and large corporate event or wedding I'm sure you will be taken care of.
4496,0,Good place to take your young out-of-town guests to show you're still hip Not a good place for us senior citizens The music is so loud as to be painful The staff are disdainful of older folk The food is strange hard core healthy Might be good spot to cure a hangover.
2420,1,This review is for the lounge that is part of this gorgeous hotel that boasts outstanding vistas along with a lush tropical feel to it  My wife wanted to check this place out for happy hour I'm glad we did The food is excellent They have $2 steak tacos on Tuesdays Although they are relatively tiny they were very tasty We had the short rib flat bread for $7 Which is not what you are thinking when you hear the word flat bread It's more like a tortilla in which you dish in the short rib meat (no bones) and lather it with this heavenly goat cheese I could have eat that cheese all night In addition we had the pretzel bread bites that came with dipping cheese The first few pretzels I dipped with the cheese but then I realized that I still had goat cheese left Think of a bagel lathered with cream cheese That's what I did with the goat cheese and pretzel bread Our total tab came to $18 (included one soda) before tipNeedless to say this place is very intimate and classy and very affordable for the regular folks  And I might add that all of the employees are professional and helpful.

1027,1,Me and malls BLECCCHHbut I have to say I love this mall  I miss this mall  I could walk this entire HUUUUUUUUUGE mall and never get bored  Tired yes but never bored  They really built this place up over the years and it's gorgeous  Some very high end but also some reasonably priced stores too  I haven't even seen it in the past few years (having moved to CA) but I speak with friends who tell me the latest happenings  They frequent this mall all the time  It's okayI WILL go back someday  This mall has something for everyone  I can't say that about most mallsat least out here in SoCal.
1162,1,This is a great Yard House  My first experience at a Yard House was a few years ago at the one in the Scottsdale mall and well that was obnoxious  Not so much the Yard House but the people  Anyways moving onThis Yard House has a great vibe about it  There's plenty of seating inside but the selling point with this location is the outdoor seating that wraps around the restaurant with plenty of heat lamps  Being that it's tucked behind Margaritaville it's a great place to sit and people watch at night  I had the Mac and Cheese which is to die for and probably the best adult mac and cheese on the planet and then I headed inside to the bar for a whiskey  Of all places in Westgate the people I ran into here were super friendly and easy to talk to  The bartenders were really friendly and I ended up staying a couple hours as the patrons at the bar didn't have the attitude as some of the neighboring restaurants and everybody was chatty  It was a fun experience  The lighting is a little dimmer inside than some restaurants but it sets the tone for the place and it works  The Yard House in general has some of the absolute best food around  If you are in the Westgate area it's a must stop for dinner or drinks.
4248,0,"I hate to hand out single star badges of honor on here but this place deserves it  When they first opened a review would have been 4 stars but lately the service from inside and wash staff drops it to one star  The last 2 times we have taken our cars in they have not been very clean including them not even trying to vacuum out the back of my wife's SUV last time she was there  To top it off when she went to pay with a coupon that can be printed off of their website at this moment they refused to accept the coupon saying that the prices have changed and we ""need to deal with it""  Mind you this coupon has no expiration date on it and is currently active on the web  We finally got a hold of a manager who was not to thrilled to correct the pricing error and lastly they charged us for an extra quart of oil when their oil changes come with 5 quarts and according to the manual the engine holds just under 5 quarts  Wont be going here again."
3363,0,"High on their horse Its ""our policy"" to not allow you to have shots of espresso over ice You HAVE to have an americano   Are you kidding me The other person in my flight crew ended up just getting a few shots of espresso and it was a big ordeal and tasted horrible  ""good luck"" was the reply when I mentioned going somewhere else As a flight crew member we come through this airport ALL the time Good way for word to travel fast about you is to give flight crew crummy service We both received attitude All we wanted was a simple order bummer was excited about the ""something different"" factor."
829,0,"I decided to go to this restaurant because of my fellow online reviewers & unfortunately it's the first time I've felt let down  My boyfriend and I went to Su Vino winery right before they were closing & needed to find a new place to eat so I pulled up Trip Advisor & found F&B had amazing reviews  As we walked in I thought the place was really cute it was really eclectic & looked very down to earthWe sat down & were asking questions to the waitress because their drink menu is a bit confusing  She seemed a little impatient with us but then would go to the table next to us (an older couple) and be so friendly & nice seemed really odd  I got the impression that maybe she thought they would spend more & tip her better but we spent over $200 on our meal so I would think that deserves a little attention  I advise all younger patrons to try not to sit in the section of the early 30's blonde waitresses unless you want rude serviceThe food was not really that spectacular either  The ambiance gives you the impression of a farm fresh type cuisine but the steak we had was not impressive at all  Grass fed beef is really my favorite because it tends to just melt in your mouth but it didn't taste much better than something you would buy in the butcher section of your grocery store  We ordered the falafel (probably the best out of everything) sunchokes (very weird it almost tastes like a potato/artichoke & I definitely do not recommend this) it tasted very unhealthy & they gave you way too muchI would have to say that the absolute worst part for me was the dessert of all things this should be executed perfectly because that's the last thing you eat before you leave  I originally ordered the trip chocolate souffle cake & was sooooo excited what a joke  I have made souffle many times & it is very difficult but what they served was not souffle it tasted like they pulled an old dessert out of the refrigerator dumped Hershey syrup on it & served it  It was dense cold & dry YUCK  I took one bite & could not eat another after 20 minutes of our dessert sitting their uneaten the waitress finally came back to check on us & I ordered the Butterscotch Pudding (their signature dessert) & the waitress said ""oh you decided to try that too""  She brought it out & then dropped off our check  Okay here's a little Serving 101 if somebody orders dessert & doesn't eat it & then orders another dessert you may want to ask if something was wrong  Not just ignore the table & then drop off the check to avoid having a conversation or to remove an item who does that  I then told her that I didn't like the dessert & to please remove it  After 25 hours a few courses $240 (with tip) later I was glad to leave  I will not be returning or recommending this place in the future in fact I've told a few people already not to waste their time in trying it."

1598,1,This is the most moving and inspiring museum I have ever been to You get to travel around the world and experience music and dance like never before  Being able to simply walk up to an exhibit without having to press a button on the headphones made the experience even more joyful  You need more than one day to truly experience all this place has to offer I wanted to listen to every snippet of song but it is overwhelming and I will simply have to come  back again and again If you are a fan of music and dance get ready to have your heart opened and your soul bathed in the beauty that all of humanity shares through their unique song and dance This is also a magnificent lesson in geographyUnique inspiring and truly a destination museum  If you have one day only to see museums in Phoenix do NOT miss this One of a kind.

3144,0,Went to the OfficeMax on Stapley asked where an item would be located in the store clerk said they did not have what I was looking for so I continued to shop found the item I asked about a little annoyed however went on my way no biggie Tonight I went into return an item  Cashier had to wait for Manager took 20 minutes then I went & found the manager and asked her to help  Manager was very rude  just continuing to say have a nice night  Very disrespectful  If she would have said I am sorry let me help you right now Instead I left there frustrated  & disrespected  After waiting 30 minutes for 2 copies and 20 minutes for a manager 50 minutes of my night was given to the elite OfficeMax that doesn't need my business   I will never step foot in this Officemax again and would encourage others not to as well.
2843,1,I come here a lot with my best friends We always order the Buffalo Chicken Quesadilla There was a bump were sometimes the cook lacked buffalo sauce but when we brought it up to attention it never happened again We never once had a problem with the service the servers are always in a good mood Kudos to the manager This place takes care of their loyal's.
998,0,Very noisy and the waiter rushed us to put in order  Tempura greasy Smelled like old oil  My cod was a small serving for $28 with no sides it was adequate that's it  They forgot one of our party's order and acted like it took longer to cook even though it was the same as mine  They took that off the bill but that was itRidiculous really for the money.
4159,0,Sorry Cornish  You have a good thing going it seems but need some polishing/cleaning  The place was doing a really brisk carryout business while we were there  Very friendly and eclectic staff  Good beer selection tooThe pasties were tasty but the temperature of the filling when reheated was not consistent - some hot spots some cool spots  I worry that this could be a recipe for food illnessThe star killer came just as we were getting ready to leave  A small roach came crawling out onto the bar in front of us  GGGAAAAHHHHDDDD.

3148,0,When you sit around and have a debate about whether or not this was the worst Mexican food you've ever had well that exemplifies what kind of experience this wasWe went on Cinco de Mayo and were in somewhat of a hurry as we had other obligations to attend to I thought that at 5pm we could slip in grab a table in the bar grab food and beverage and get on our wayTo be quick and to the point the service was good but the food was absolutely garbage Bland flat uninspired Between the purple power rangers (Pro-Tem Rent-a-Cop) the 20 year old manager and the horrific food I'll go out of my way to not go here again.

12,1,I thought this Sweet Tomatoes was brand new when I walked it  Very Clean and everyone was friendly and attentive  The staff at this location are a class act    The salad bar and it's topping were well maintained and fresh  I especially liked their array of pasta salads  The Tarragon and Tuna and the Asian Peanut were my favorites  I am a soup lover and could spend my entire meal there alone  I got a second ok a third helping of the Spicy Sausage with Pasta and beans  Pizza was good as was the hot pasta selection  I definitely plan on coming back here again and againeven though it's not the closest Sweet Tomatoes to me it is by far the best I've been to in the Valleykudos.

1992,0,"My husband and I used to eat at La Parilla in Mesa often However our last experience was the worst ever We had out of town guests and took them here for some good Mexican cuisine Our waiter was incredibly rude and acted as though he could not be bothered with us Everything was an inconvenience to him We asked for extra napkins and refills on our water and he acted as though we asked him for a kidneyHe took his time bringing us water and forget about getting a refill on our chips Apparently he could not be bothered to do his job We were mortified and embarrassed at how we were treated His name is ""Rodriguez"" (at least that's what was printed on our bill) The food was delicious but the waiter's attitude ruined what would have been a great eveningI tried to let the management know what happened but their email has conveniently been full for weeks We will NEVER go back to this place We'd sooner eat at Taco Bell then to be treated as poorly as we were FIRE RODRIGUEZ."

600,1,I love love love this store Other than an actual Farmer's Market I can't find a better deal on fresh produce The also have an extensive health supplement sectionStaff is _always_ cheerful and helpful and having this kind of store open until 10 every night ROCKSTheir specials can be very good and change weekly For instance one month they were offering discounts on ALL gluten free foods (well tagged) which was very helpful to someone like me who experiments with my diet Another week the had 25% off ALL supplements (I went nuts on Udo's and Raw Vitamin products)Note: They normally offer a monthly flyer and a weekly flyer On Wednesdays the previous week AND the current week specials are vaildI'm not sure what other people are complaining about regarding prices I meticulously keep a database of the products I buy where I buy them and how much they cost Other than a few bulk items I buy at Costco (and of course Farmer's markets) these are the lowest I've foundThat being said I can't always find what I want at Farmer's markets and since I shop for only one I don't require bulk foods so much.
1943,1,Best pizza I found so far in tempe A little pricey but you get your money worth I like the mamma's spinach CALZONE The mamma's spinach pizza wasnt as good Be prepared for some garlic though You may want to ask w/o garlic if you dont like it -)  overall really really good.

1521,1,When I'm casual but want to feel NYC I go to Christopher's  We go here for a special occasion dinner or on the fly happy hourwhich is the best HH food in town  Let me repeat that - best in town  Hamburger with truffle fries brick oven pizza or a perfect salmon salad plus a beer or glass of wine for about $10/person Can't beat it  Sitting at the open kitchen makes me appreciate the setup and organization required to run a restaurant as well as the chef's tats  If you don't want the blaring heat of the brick oven don't sit at the corner next to itPhoenix is HOT enough in the summer so cool off and let someone else do the cooking.
2777,1,WOW  What more can I say   I love this store  Talk about variety  I could spend hours just wandering the isles contemplating different things to make and the seafood section in the back well let's just say this is the only place I go to get my seafood  Prices are very reasonable and service is very good  Just be patient with some of the staff when it comes to communicating as they are not all fluent in English  But they make every effort to assist you and make your shopping experience a pleasant one  If you have never been and plan on going  Make sure you free up enough time to actually go through the entire store and see all the things they have.
4406,0,I loathe to write a bad review for one of my favorite hobbies drinking craft beer however Sun Up is a brewing company that I feel the need to never visit again nor would I recommend beer lovers to go out of their way to stop inThe majority of the beer was just plain boring and warm to boot They had a lager wheat amber pale oatmeal stout and a scottish red on draft  None of the beer sampled tasted even close to what I would consider the fundamentals of that particular category ie a very bitter amber ale and a sweet and not-hoppy-whatsoever pale ale  Even the root beer was flat and tasteless  I initially was going to give this place two stars mainly because they do serve beer and the bartender was nice  but thinking about the beer I have to knock this down to one star  Sorry Sun Up but you need to go back to the drawing board and create some good basic craft brew.

1437,1,"One of the oldest buildings in Tempe a real treat to be inside except during the horrible Arizona summers The building is swamp-cooled so it is huuuuumid during many days of the summer It is usually PACKED around dinner time (5-7) most days and especially on Thursdays The ""DJ"" plays pretty good music I put him in quotes because the few times I've seen the music system it's a Macbook hooked up to someone's itunes collection No problem with that though--me and the guy have pretty similar tastes in music The waitresses here are great nine times out of ten and they are always good-looking (do they even let males serve here) The barrel fries are great even if they are still $550 for a considerable deduction in the amount of fries you get recently They usually have a ""special"" or ""chef's choice"" menu where you can get something that isn't a usual menu item Good for dates The hefeweizen contains banana clove which is amazing The peach ale is a favorite among many women I know and Kiltlifter is always great if you're looking to take a nap soon (heavy) My only gripe is that the happy hour starts at 11 Sheesh."

285,1,Never having dealt with a Discount Tire in Phoenix before (only in Texas and their service has been great all the time) I came in not knowing what kind of service to expect I was pleasantly surprised The store had a good amount of parking and the store front was clean open and had adequate seating around the perimeters There were already 5-6 people sitting and waiting for their cars to be finished and 2 people waiting infront of me to see a representative All the guys working there were busy helping someone yet were saying hello to us and reassuring they'd get to us very soon I didn't wait an unneccesary amount of time and then was helped by Wally He inspected my tires recommended a plan of action gave me options and we headed back into the store After I made my decision to replace 2 of the tires he checked their stock and unfortunately they didn't have them there BUT he called another store and had them picked up for the next morning so I could just come back the next day to this same store and get those bad boys installed Great The prices were not as heafty (relief) and although there were a good amount of people the next day waiting for their cars to also be serviced it took exactly the amount of time they'd told me (45 min) They apologized for the wait but no need for that The guy who helped me on the 2nd day (I'm sorry I forgot his name) was also very professional and great I recommend this store and will be bringing my car here in the future most definitely Thanks guysTIP: If you know you need to bring your car in you can make an appointment with them online They take walk-ins but I believe it helps them manage their customers easier and that in turn benefits you.
2852,1,This place is great to get any nail service I like how big and spacious the area is and how they get customers in and out You barely have to wait and thats if you have to wait at all There's a menu of services for pedicures which gives you a selection So you dont get stuck with just the normal pedicure and they take their time as well You get your money's worth Pricing is average Go for a mani and pedi to give it a go : ).
3564,0,I went there 2 times for a back problem The first time they gave me full attention and i was very satisfied The second time they split my time with someone else and i had about 15 minutes of time However they had no problem charging my insurance company and myself for full service  When i called and complained they made all kinds of excusesand still wanted the money instead of saying it was the wrong thing to do Ipaid them  however i would never return buyer beware.
1340,1,It didn't even take longer than 3 minutes into our meal before everyone was thanking me for recommending Cafe Carumba as our lunch venue on Friday How could I recommend anything else though It was close to the office I hadn't been there before and well they serve breakfast til 2pm EVERY DAY There was absolutely nothing disappointing about this experience A large group of us gathered there on Friday and when I arrived we had received a room in the back all to ourselves with a long table It was absolutely perfect Our server was a true gem We had waters on our table when we arrived and he put up with our wishy washyness when it came to our orders I started off with a mimosa that despite being pulpy which I typically don't care for was absolutely enchanting It came in a wine glass instead of a champagne glass More is better :)As it came time to order I couldn't move past the breakfast menu and thought I had settled on the perfect treat Then I was told by the server there was an underground breakfast menu that included five different types of eggs benedict Yes you heard me correctly I did say five There was the traditional one one with avocado one with portabello one with crab cakes instead of an english muffin which a coworker got and the steak one that I decided to try When our food first started to arrive we were told it was being brought out as its done so it stays hot We began to worry that we would be eating without everyone but that worry lasted maybe 45 seconds as instantly the rest of the food was brought out Silence followed for at least the first 10 minutes aside from messages of thanks and grunts of happinessThe potatoes are as heavenly as everyone says you need to have them I also recommend the eggs benedict with steak instead of canadian bacon I typically down my breakfast (ask anyone) but I couldn't finish my last eggs benedict I did manage to have two mimosas though YumAt the end of the meal the sever brought me out a foil rose which I've attached and still have Why can't all men be as sweetIn the end the food is phenomenal the mimosas are exquisite and larger than the ones elsewhere service is prompt and extremely friendly I will be back again.
2370,1,I love this place  Went on this occassion with a gf for hh and just the best experience (not there has ever been a bad one)  The hostess sat us on the patio promptly and we were immediately greeted by our server who also happened to be VERY handsome  We had the best service all night very attentive and as good as it gets The food as always top notch  Great portion sizes and quality  We shared the mushroom ravioli prawns and cheeseburger and all were to die for I think my favorite were the prawns great size and spicy amazingness Overall doesn't get better and for the HH prices it's icing on the cake.
674,0,Super slow service I'm currently sitting here waiting for my takeout order I have been here for roughly 25 minutes and am receiving no help We might as well have eaten hereI probably would have gotten my food faster.
3322,0,My experience at this salon could not have been worse I was the maid of honor for my bestie's wedding and a group of 6 of us went in the morning before the wedding to get pedis and the bride also got a mani The lady at the front desk was the grumpiest woman on earth but whatever We got our pedis and it was mostly enjoyable The technicians were not all excellent but for the most part we were happy with the results The environment was comfortable and clean and it was a relaxing morningThe problem was that just 5 hours later the bride's nails were already chipping She wasn't washing dishes or doing anything crazy but she was running some errands and doing the normal last minute stuff before a wedding Unfortunately even though we had made a big deal about this being the bride the nail techs did not recommend something longer lasting like acrylic nails or even gels for the bride so we hadn't thought much about the mani she got until it started chipping Ok fine We decide to go in the morning of the wedding and have them touch up her mani assuming they will do that for us for no charge because it was their work that hadn't held up False They charged her for a whole new manicure So here's my friend totally in tears the morning of her wedding and these people are telling her she should have got a gel manicure instead (she never gets manicures so she didn't even know what that was) and telling her it was her fault that her nails chipped within 5 hours of having them done It was so ridiculous Needless to say I'll never go back to this place and recommend you skip it too Awful customer service Awful attitudes.
3444,0,"I try to like you Postinos I really do but you make it so hard  Came on a Tuesday for their 8 PM $20 Bottle of wine and bruschetta special and left disappointed and annoyedThe parking lot disaster strikes again  LGO now put up signs saying 25 min parking for LGO customers only and has a lot monkey stationed to chase away people trying to park in those spaces  I was told by the lot monkey that I could valet ($3 charge) or I could park 3 blocks away if I didn't want to pay the fee  Keep in mind this is a Tuesday and I have to pay to park my car because the restaurant blocks off all the spacesOnce seated my friend and I tried to catch up for a moment when the server came over to take our drink orders  Since we had just sat down we asked for some time to take a look at the menu  Our server came back a few minutes later and asked if we were ready to order  No suggestions on a wine no questions if we had questions just ""you ready to order""We ordered a bottle and bruschetta and our waiter disappeared  For the rest of the night  I watched him refill wine glasses at other tables ours was brought by another server  Other tables had their plates cleared when they were finished ours sat in front of us until another server took them away  Our server obviously didn't want our business because about an hour after we sat down he came back to the table and asked if we were interested in any dessert  We said no and he immediately dropped the check on the table and left  No offer of another round of drinks just here is your checkThe wine we had was amazing and was a steal at the price plus the bruschetta  The bruschetta themselves were half assed  3 of the 4 weren't even sliced all the way through but over all they were decentYet again Postinos shows they want my money but not my patronage  I don't understand how I am the only one who keeps having horrible experiences here."

2994,1,This is bad this place is right across the street from where I work and I fear I will spend all of my money hereSosososo good Great Soy LatteI wish they had bigger sized cups because it soo good.
1913,1,I was looking for a unique setting to have a Holiday party for my staff of 17  Heinrich was gracious and accommodated my request to have the function on the patio with heaters and surrounding the large fire pit  It was great  The wait staff especially Kristen did a great job making sure everyone had what they wished  I'm looking forward to bringing my wife and this time I can enjoy the wine menu too.
893,1,El Chorro is my favorite spot for Sunday brunch  I ordered the omelette of the day served with potato cake/hash browns roasted tomatoes and a giant english muffin the best breakfast I've had in a long time  Not to mention their complementary sticky buns  As if that wasn't enough the atmosphere is unbeatable  Shade misters and an exquisite view.
1459,0,"I am actually really disappointed in the service I got today I went in and was deciding what I wanted to get I saw that there was a chocolate moo'd and a peanut butter moo'd I asked if I could mix the two so I could share the drink with my girlfriend The girl answered: ""Yeah they're both made of the same thing with different things in them"" I'm still not sure what that means She then snapped at my girlfriend and didn't even ask us if we wanted a free boost It's a shame because I don't think we have ever had bad service at this establishment It's one reason we've returned consistently."
3718,0,My first and last Whatacrappyburger Nasty grey patty and one of the heaviest burgers ever Needed to cook some more once back home but i could only eat half of this junk before I threw in the towel Free fries and drink helped soften the blow but this chain is a disaster In and Out is way better I can't believe how bad the burger was too bad cause they spend alot of money on billboards but not even on quality food obviously.
2658,1,My wife and I seem to be on the hunt for the perfect breakfast place here in North Scottsdale  Many to choose from and Butters is our new favorite  First of all the atmosphere on the patio was our first hint that we'd like it here  There is a fountain right off the back and the sounds and smells that make for a pleasant experience  They were also playing fun music on the patio as well  Nothing loud or obnoxious but it was a welcomed addition on a Sunday morning  Secondly this is somewhat like a cafe  They have a barista bar there and the latte my wife got was very tasty and my coffee was very excellent  Our meals were very good as well  When it comes to breakfast foods you don't need to reinvent the wheel  They served good food and at a good price and great atmosphere  We will definitely be back**Update**We went back again this Sunday and had another great experience  The service was awesome and the food was even better  I went out on a limb and tried something I usually wouldn't get the Corned Beef Hash Skillet topped with over easy eggs  It was amazing  It also was a lot of food  I ate about half of it but I am so glad I tried it.
250,1,Life's question to people who eat at Souper Salad: Why Why would you punish yourself with a crappy salad bar when you could spoil yourself by eating at Sweet Tomatoes Ohhhhh my gosh Sweet tomatoes: and endless ocean of comfort foods all you can eat for a low price Sounds too good to be true doesn't it I've been eating here since I was a little kid not at this one specifically but at this chain It is called Souplantation in California A huge line of salad goodies (a ton of yummy treats too many to name) usually 6-8 different soups potato bar pasta bar bread bar muffin/dessert bar fruit/jello etc and a soft serve bar Not to mention they have a pretty great beverage selection It's hard to not overeat here but I never feel guilty since I eat so many veggies while I'm here Beware if you go at 6 this place gets rocking for dinner If you're lucky you'll be there while they walk around with hot chocolate chip cookies Bottom line You like choices you like salad bars Eat here :-).
1448,1,Nice coffee shop Didn't find it on Google Maps though.
399,1,"We tried the store over Avondale and it was fine but this store BLOWS IT OUT OF THE WATER We stayed right next to the bell location but it didn't ""look safe"" according to my wife so we came over here Great location (area) staff was friendly and store was super clean."
4583,0,Buyer beware that the prices they show on line are not the same prices you find when you call  i was sold a org domain even when I told them that I was a for profit business  They didn't tell me org were reserved for non-profits  When I tried to get my money back they said I could use the org even though my web developer said I shouldn't  i wanted to buy another domain but when I told them the price online they said they were having problems with their website  I went ahead and purchased while I was on hold and hung up  It seems like their employees are pressured into hard sales because the first time I tried to by a domain name for $799 the guy I spoke to tried to pressure me into buying things I didn't need  When I refused he transferred me to another rep by saying he didn't handle this type of call The second person I spoke to was very pleasant.
1343,1,Still live in Flagstaff still love The Duce and I'd like to think DJ Luis is still my bff even after all these years While I love the overall atmosphere and drinks Luis and his karaoke/music playing prowess are basically why I go out of my way to stop at the Duce whenever I'm in town He has pretty much any song you' d ever want to hear or sing and he's totally cool no better place in town to sing karaoke and there's plenty of room on the dance floor to get down.
1484,1,Where do I start  Canes sauceFreaking yummy  Texas ToastYUMMY  and the chicken so moist and juicy not greasy or or nasty  I cannot wait until the one on the West side of town is finished so we can eat it more often  Wish they had a few more options on the menu but in allmost of my family love chicken and fries  Thanks Canes.

3918,0,"I'm pregnant and craving Mexican  I hadn't been to this restaurant in years and decided to give it another try  Being on a budget I didn't have that much to spend on lunch for my boyfriend and I  First thing that turned me off was printed in the menu  Only 1 refill of the chips and salsa before they charged $199 for more  Also only 1 refill on drinks (which were absurdly expensive for iced tea and lemonade: $225 each)  Any restaurant that charges that much for drinks and limits your refills to 1 turns me off especially here in the desert  My boyfriend had a chimichanga with shredded beef which was pretty good and I tried the enchiladas with ""mole"" sauce  It was absolutely disgusting  I sent it back and asked for chicken enchiladas with green sauce  Decent but not worth $1049 they charged for simple enchiladas  The chips were nothing to write home about honestly a Fry's bag of $1 would have been much more appealing  The salsa (a trio of regular green and hot) was bland and tasteless albeit spicy (which didn't help my sudden need to suck down the limited drink I had ordered)  I am reliving the food even now as it gave me horrible heartburn and left me feeling extremely nauseas  I will never be going back ever again."
4388,0,I made appointments for my daughter and I to have mani-pedicures  We are from another state and I just moved here and she was visiting me and we thought it would be fun  I checked Yelp and saw good reviews so I was thinking this would be a great treat for my daughter  I had the man working on me and he did a passable job but the woman who worked on my daughter didn't speak any English and within hours her manicure was chipping off and she had to re-file her toenails because they were so jagged and sharp  Our feet were so dry from the pedicures that we had to apply tons of lotion to them to make them stop hurting  The manicures hurt for days from all nicks we had around our nails from the cuticle scissors they used  We would not recommend this nail salon to anyone  By the time my daughter left from her vacation her nail polish had completely chipped off  What a waste of $8500.
3707,0,"HORRIBLE- greasy tempura and flat on one side  the roll was loaded with rice and that's about it  The waitress sat with her friends and talked even tho I needed some attenttion  At the end she thought by calling me ""doll"" that would make up for everything  I could not have been more disappointed and won 't ever do back- These guys will never take the place of Blue Wasabi."
2582,0,Mediocre food at best and overpriced.
1004,1,Fantastic We had a very big table for a family dinner on Saturday Samanda was our waitress and she KICKED ASS We devoured everything including cheesecake for dessert The Burger here is 100% my favorite thing on the menu The steaks were fantastic but the bone marrow was a bit scary My veggie chopped salad was massive and very good but the dressing might be an acquired taste The tuna tartar and crab cakes were tasty appys However nothing and I mean NOTHING can come close to the popovers I wish I could just get a glass of wine and a popover for dinner Seriously thats all i need in the end Dont be a no carb bitch and turn these down They are worth every single ounce of delish *** I googled them less than 300 calories for the whole thing***  Again worth every single one The outside atmosphere is just perfect here BIg fireplace and lots of nice people to enjoy the sunset with Cant go wrong.
3872,0,When they first opened they had awesome prices on the meats now they are the same as anywhere else The fruit and veggies go bad in a day or less not a good thingNo reason to drive 8 miles out of my way when I can get the same if not better products closer to me.
1509,0,First time to the mellow mushroom was very excited Took over an hour to get the pizza waitressed blamed the amount of people in the restaurant and how busy they were restaurant was maybe 20% occupancy Service was absolutely awful Pizza was okay but the service really killed it.
3867,0,Total sports bar borderline dive bar and it has been around foEVA  I get that many patrons feel that it is an institution but really it's just a burger joint that caters to a bunch of alcoholics and has crappy service from pretty much everyone who works the barRude lazy pron to ignore you on a regular basis Or don't want to wait on you because they are going off shift in like 20minutes   Are you effing kidding me with this  Take my firkin order and treat me like the paying customer that I amChristI go here from time to time because I work at the local college and my friends and colleagues like to go after work because it's close and I don't want to be difficult so I go alongI for whatever reason am no longer a beer drinker but I try and keep it low maintenance because I know these types of bartenders don't like to make cocktails and I really don't want any enemies  So I order a vodka and club soda with extra lime because  I figure it's easy and I don't care for tonic  Yeah well apparently this can't be done well because the club soda is ALWAYS flat and the drink tastes like crappy vodka and tap water  So I asked how the club soda was on this particular visit and they said much better since the fireI was hopeful didn't quite get why the fire might have fixed the problem but hopeful nonetheless  But no it was the same shitty flat water and I hated to have to send it back because I knew this dude was gong to give attitude because that's how he do  Hell he was doin that when he told me the fire helped the waterdick really and so unnecessaryYup attitude took the drink back and I settled for a glass of wine equally difficult to drink but I just shut up about it and smile  Then we were ignored until I actually had to ask him a third time to take our food orderI wouldn't call myself a regular but they recognize me in there and I know them by name  My colleagues know the staff far better than I but either way why be shitty to customers who are trying to be cool and not too difficult   And honestly who would like to sip a beverage that reminds her that she too could be homeless and filtering rubbing alcohol through a sock  WHY Hamburger Works staff is it OK with you to be rude and lame to your customers  Oh I know you don't like people who expect you to do your job like wipe off the food debris left on the table and booths  Maybe wait on customers with a friendly attitude and not argue about the fact that I must be drinking a different kind of club soda  Really  How about considering that perhaps the club soda you are pouring is tap water or at the very least admit that it's horribly flatStupid stuff to even give my time to really but unfortunately I have had enough of these experiences over the years and decided today was the last cocktail strawIt's a shitty bar that stinks with a lousy and entitled wait staff none of whom really know how to make a decent drink and if they do know they don't want you to knowI vowed tonight in the presences of my friends that I will never be going back here again  I don't care if we only have a moment to grab a bite and a drink  Sooo not worth the attitude and the funky smells that embed themselves in my clothing and hairOy vey I need to go take a bath right now.
952,1,Service is always great and food is consistent Huge fan of the fez burger or shrimp kisra The garlic aioli is out of this world.
1093,1,"T Cook's is my favorite restaurant in AZ thus far I really enjoy the spanish colonial architecture gardens water fountains patio and charming walk-ways and courtyard The ambiance is extremely romantic and puts me in a calming reflective mood I can seriously see myself getting married @ the Royal Palms I've read some of the reviews and I've always had great service here I remembered one of my dates had asked for a romantic corner to seat at and not only did they give us a romantic corner but the hostess came with a basket of fresh rose petals and placed them all over our table My date must have seriously thought he was going to get laid that night by just that gesture alone but was mistaken lol Anyways I love the lobster bisque-not too salty and just creamy enough I've enjoyed the Asian pear salad too which is flavorful and has great texture But if you're looking for one appetizer to try definitely get the sauteed shrimp & calamari in an organic yellow tomato sauce Fra Diablo My mouth just started watering It's not breaded calamari so it's healthier and also tastes better (5 stars)As for the main course:-Pan roasted duck breast with spiced confit pave sage gnocchi & roasted butternut squash is 3 stars I'm not much of a duck person but the roasted butternut squash was to die for and the duck was tender-Wood roasted ""Pulet Rouge"" checkan with a rosemary polenta cake asparagus and Swiss chard is 4 stars Any meat prepared wood roasted gives it a twist in flavor which I appreciate I usually ask for asparagus steamed so I'm not sure how the Swiss chard is (gotta watch my figure)-I've tried their fish (they change their menus from time to time) nibbled on my date's plates and everything has been really goodI want to try one of their pasta dishes next time when I'm not dieting The bar area is also super sexy sleek and mysterious They usually have a live piano player at night I seriously could come here weekly for just the calamari and architecture-it's like you're in another world besides the AZ desert It's become my escape to mini paradise."
4630,0,"I can summarize this in one word  YUCK  We went for dinner/supper which is part of the problem  We ordered t-bone steak and chicken  The salad bowl had a hole right through the plastic and the steak was way thin  We ordered it medium and any steak that thin just ends up being cooked as ""well done"" anyway  Everything comes with grease dripping hash browns whether you want them or not  At least the staff was friendly enough and food (if you call it that) was served quickly  My personal recommendation is that if you're not going to eat breakfast go somewhere else."
94,1,I seriously can't believe I haven't ever written a review of my favorite Mexican place in the entire world Not like this place is still a secret which is a good thing because hopefully that means it's not going anywhere I should mention that I can't normally eat a lot of food in one sitting But something magical happens to my stomach when I walk into Carolina's I'm suddenly able to put away twice the amount of food as my male dining companions The problem is I can't ever decide whether to get the bean and cheese burrito or the red machaca burrito so I just end up getting both And finishing both And it's not even difficult These have to be two of the best burritos in the history of the world and I'm sure a lot of it has to do with the ridiculously delicious tortillas they make here I always pick up a dozen to take back with me to NYC just to show people here that good Mexican DOES exist It's just all sadly located in slightly shady parts of Phoenix (or in SoCal or in actual Mexico) The wait to order is never very long but the wait to get your food does seem endless It's only because they make everything fresh to order though And it probably just feels like an eternity because I've really been waiting several MONTHS to eat this food and that's just added to the 500 minute wait for the food to arrive They have something here that I have never seen beforea Coke fountain AND a Pepsi fountain And a smaller fountain with ok-tasting horchata and other Mexican refrescas So no more fighting over whether a place is Coke or Pepsi they've got it all covered I could probably write several essays' worth of love for this place but I'll save you all the time-just get off your butt and get to Carolina's ASAP And if you're heading to NYC bring me some tortillas :).
1271,1,Its been years since Ive been to an Outback and I was so pleasantly surprised how wonderful everything was this evening My boyfriend and I both got the 4 courses for $15 which is a screaming deal for the amount of food you get The french onion soup was a $1 up charge but totally worth it We asked for our steaks medium rare unaware of how thick an outback special would be They came more rare than medium rare so I did what I absolutely hate to do I sent it back Our server Christopher was so nice about it and seemed more interested in making sure we were actually enjoying our evening The manager stopped by to apologize (even though it was no one's fault but my own) and told me the steaks would be up in a minute or two We were so full so Christopher boxed up our desserts for us to go ALSO I ordered the skinny rita which was also amazing very light and refreshing perfect to start before a 4 course dinner We will be back because of the food management and our awesome server Chris.
1007,1,Most authentic Indian food outside of India  I know because I've been   Don't let the idea of  exotic food scare you awaythere's something for everyone here even vegetarians and children  Try the paneer (pressed cheese) dishes or samosas choley if you don't like meat  Try the chicken or paneer Makhani if you don't like the heat  For medium-spicy dishes the Chicken Tikka Masala is excellent with a side of rice and naan bread  If you want a bite of something that'll bite you back with a really great flavor try the Tandoor Fish wrap  The key to eating reasonably is to go as a group of 2 or more get rice and naan and a couple different items to share with the entire table  You don't have to drink alcohol but there's a full service bar at all 3 of the Tandoori Times locations and the beer selection is above-average  This is the original location and offers a great semi-upscale atmosphere and a nice patio complete with hookah  Bellydancers join the fun on Friday and Saturday nights  Decent value if you crave very good quality food an exotic atmosphere and an authentic Indian experience  Ok the bellydancing isn't exactly authentic but it's definitely exciting  One of my favorite weekend hangoutssolid 5 out of 5.
4814,0,I had a really scathing review of this place and the owner emailed me and asked me to take it down so I am  But I have to say I think the food here is dull and tasteless  I would never go back  One of my critical remarks about the food in this valley is that many places are dumbed down without heat or flavor  So maybe this place is just fine for those people who prefer that type of food.
4859,0,I ordered a double burrito meaning two burritos lengthwise The incompetent workers then proceeded to fill my scrawny excuse of a burrito with very scant and stingy single scoop portions I ordered and PAYED for 2 burritos and it came out looking like an average sized burrito I was a regular customer and I 100% to ever return to this location Don't go the people working are imbeciles.
4913,0,I really cannot rate the quality of the food as I never actually got my meal After waiting for 25 minutes and asking numerous times if my order was still on its way I was told that they did not know what happened to my order but they were out of steak now I opted for a refund as I had to return to work My only suggestion don't go there if there is a chance they will be busy.
4235,0,DON'T EAT HERE UNLESS YOU WANT CLEANING FLUIDS AND OTHER DEBRIS IN YOUR FOOD We were eating at this location about 1-2 times a month but no more not after what we saw today We were seated near the food area and looked up to see staff cleaning the food stands and vents above the food and prep areas Debris was falling in the food and the cleaning fluids were being sprayed over the food DISGUSTING I spoke to the supervisor and she could not care less Don't eat here unless you want to get sick.
520,1,I must say the freshness and and the taste of the pizza here is going to give bianco a run for his money We had 2 different pies but the clincher has the meats that hey use on there pies wow When I got the check it was almost half of bianco's price with out all the wait time I will be back.

2681,1,"I went here for my birthday a few months ago and was completely floored by the taste of the food AmazingI liked that it was a tapas style restaurant because my Dad and his girlfriend don't (usually) have big appetites although my husband and I doWe loved the atmosphere as soon as we walked in We ordered some delicious sake And we ordered a little bit of everything I thought the vegetarian selection was decent I can't remember exactly what we ordered but I remember us all ravenously digging into every plate then greedily waiting for the next The flavors were phenomenal We HAD to have more We ordered another round of tapas and sake More gluttony followed My Dad and his girlfriend ate like pigs But even after about a dozen small plates we weren't filledMy only complaint is the huge bill at the end $140 But I do take responsibility for not keeping track of the mounting expense The small plates seem reasonably priced but you need to order enough to get fill your stomach Again we loved the atmosphere I loved the erotic art by the bathroom My Dad scoffed ""That's nothing new Same shit I saw in the '60's"" Whatever My Dad claims he has already seen everything before at least he was impressed by the foodI will definitely be back And give their happy hour a try to relieve some of the burden off my wallet."
1538,0,I would have never chosen to go here but my buddy made me go He was looking for an old Western Town and his parents went here years ago  I hated to tell him that there was no mechanical bull back in 1888 When we got here there were families celebrating birthdays with kids and large groups of people coming in on tourist buses It was kind of like a tourist trap The musical act on stage was uninspiredseemed like they were just playing their music set taking long breaks and collecting there check The food was okayan Outback Steakhouse would have tasted better My drink came in a cracked glasshow does a bartender not see that before they pour a drink Answer: Someone who is bad at there job and collecting there check The fun parts of the evening:  the Rattlesnake we had for dinner It tasted like Calamari And the actors in the old western town  They were in character and it was funny to have conversations with them It reminded me of that episode of South Parkwhen the boys went on the field trip to an old western townI think the creators of the show might have come here for research If I had kids I would go back here because it would be fun for them  I would not go here for the food.
690,1,My husband and I are SO glad we discovered this place It is 5 miles from our house but worth the drive The donuts are fresh great variety great tasting and inexpensive SO much better than Dunkin and Krispy Kreme IMHO.
1604,1,GO HERE Seriously just go Stop reading this review and go eat some tacos because I don't want this place to shut down It's surprisingly uncrowded for such a nice little Mexican spot Granted it's new and I hear their other location does pretty well so maybe they just need a little while to get their following in this neighborhood (Watch everyone reads my glowing review and pretty soon I won't even be able to get a table)Their margaritas are perfect and their $1 tacos from 4-7 pm during the week can't be beat  The staff is super friendly and the food comes out quickly  Love their beans so make sure to get a side of those with your happy hour tacos  Last Friday my husband and I stopped in got 2 margaritas 5 tacos chips and salsa and a side of rice and beans for $15  Such a steal.
1506,1,Love this place  Tell everyone about it  I've only gotten to go twice but have loved it both times  The staff is supper friendly and have gone out of their way to make sure we are taking care of without hovering or bugging us  I love how casual it is: order at the counter pick it up and take a seat  Last time my husband and i got our own dishes but this time we split a pulled pork sandwich with the potato salad side  Not a heavy meal but just enough: spent $8  I don't even like potato salad but have cravings for this amazing salad with a kick  Last time i had to take leftovers home and they didn't just put it in a box but properly wrapped itI'm fastidious about cleanliness and customer service and have hall all expectations exceededMy only complaint is that the bun of the sandwich is too thick but delicious  So i just don't eat the whole thing.
551,0,Avoid this corrupt company terrible I sent my wife in for an oil change and to get the brakes looked at because they were squeekingThey did the oil change and told her that the rotors would have to be ground down or replaced and the rear brakes needed to be cleaned the bill would be about $40000I said no bought $1800 brake pads from another company and did the repair myself in about an hourWhen I looked at the rotors they were LIKE GLASS in immaculate condition absolutely did not require any grinding/replacement  (the vehicle is only a few years old with low mileage) They completely tried to take advantage of my wife fabricated a completely false story about the vehicle to try to make a quick buck they should be shut down You've been warned.
4678,0,I have been to several Mellow Mushroom locations and recommended this place to my co-workers It was by far the worse experience I have ever had A group of eight people and very few other customers we received poor service It took a while to receive our drinks and once we got our food after waiting for over an hour several personal pizzas were delivered to our table UNCOOKED They returned their pizzas and the second pizzas they brought back were not what they order They still even charged those guest Several guest had major stomach aches from the uncooked food A big disappointment for Mellow Mushroom.
368,1,Fast friendly and deliciousMy favorite Large supreme with extra jalepenos.
3037,0,I learned of this company through a living social deal I emailed them to set up an appointment The earliest available date was a month later I went ahead and scheduled the appointment in spite of the wait time One month went by  on the scheduled day of cleaning in which I was told they would arrive between 12 and 1 NO ONE shows up I wait at 3:30 I email asking why was this scheduled appointment not kept I've yet to get a response or an explanationThere are many cleaning companies out there my suggestion - try a different one than Maid 4 it all.
67,0,This was absolutely horrible I got the supreme pizza with the mystery meats  I threw it in the trash I will wait until I get to my destination to eat Horrible.
307,1,With the exception that they should have made this one twice as big (you can hardly find a seat around noon) I've never once had a wrong order and sometimes I order some complex stuff Employees are like overly happy which is actually sometimes annoying but oh well But yeah In N Out hardly even needs a review everyone knows the food is always incredibleAnd Amanda B is right There used to be a little green house that was on this lot before they finally gave in.
1325,1,wow this place is poppin I went here w my fiance to eat and we met the owner George himself since he was working the register We told him we were from out of town and asked about the different gyro's they served- He was so nice he hooked us up w two sodas and the food was only $7 Huge portions and fresh flavors Def coming back when I am in Arizona again Great customer service.
4078,0,"Open Road Tours nearly ruined our vacation  We booked our Grand Canyon tour several weeks in advance but they called to cancel LAST MINUTE (literally 5pm on the Sunday before our Monday tour)  The customer service rep cited weather issues and told us that given their 25 years of experience there would be fog in the canyon and it really wouldn't be worth the trip up thereAfter about an hour of wallowing in dejection we optimistically decided to just try calling around to see if any other tour companies were operating  Every single tour company we called (we went to tripadvisor and started with the highest rated) was still operating tours to the Grand Canyon but many of them were full  We finally managed to snag the last 2 spots with another company and there were absolutely NO visibility issues at all  In fact the day was extremely clear and the Grand Canyon was spectacularOpen Road Tours was extremely unprofessional in not helping us find an alternate way to see the Grand Canyon after we expressed that it was our whole purpose in visiting Phoenix and the day we booked was the only day we could go  Rather than call peers to secure us spots they told us there was nothing they could do unless we wanted to book on another day (impossible since we were leaving the next day)  Given that there were absolutely no actual weather issues and they had actually already attempted to reschedule the tour prior to the ""weather cancellation"" due to insufficient bookings on Monday the entire experience leaves a bad taste in my mouthPARTING THOUGHT: Why take a chance with your vacation and book with an unreliable tour company when there are so many excellent options in the area."

687,1,This Discount Tire location has made a customer for life Everyone was friendly and the prices were fair Also I was in and out in about 30 minutes tires and all I was very impressed with the manager who went above and beyond what was needed I would definitely recommend this location to everyone.
210,1,Great foodI recommend the waffles with bacon and hash brownsamazing strawberry lemonade Went on a saturday early afternoon and only had maybe a 5 minute waitdef going again.
675,1,The only club car dealers in the area Great customer service and always helping the best they can If your on the market for a golf cart (gas or electric) and want the best come here for a club car golf cart and you'll be glad you did.
3260,0,I went to this place twice to really give them a chance I wanted to like it so very much It's in a really cool old building and it's downtown but easy to drive to but I'm not going back The place looks like a giant disorganized thrift store The food is terrible and super expensive for what it is I got french fries once which were ok but way too greasy and kind of soggy The second time I got a salad which was starting to rot and was drenched with a very thick sweet dressing It was the worst salad I've ever had To top it off on my second and last visit one of the owners made fun of higher quality beer I don't know anyone who would purchase semi expensive food and then order a super crappy beer to go with it This place just doesn't seem well thought out.
1470,1,We love Yogurtini  Our favorite flavors are the mint  chocolate & peanut butter  They have all the toppings you could imagine  I especially enjoy the mochi seriously tasty    The yogurt shop is located very close to yummy restraunts & lots of shopping so it is excellent choice for your desert destination.
916,1,Can't get more authentic than this Polish family runs the place and makes all their own meats and sausage They carry many crackers condiments and other imported goods from Poland etc They also make a decent sandwich for 5 or 6 bucks Warning Cash only.
2569,1,Wonderful environment to watch a game great ambiance although it did take a while to get acknowledged when we sat at the bar Try the Ruben it's outstanding and prices are reasonable If you have to eat near the convention center and are crunched for time it's the perfect spot.
2555,1,If you're a Tempe/Mesa native or an ASU student or alum then you probably know Haji-Baba I however am neither and only recently discovered this awesome place by way of a recommendation on TwitterSince then I've been there five times and have tried nearly everything on the menu The food is delicious Seriously there hasn't been one thing I've tried that I haven't enjoyedOn my first trip I ordered the combination I highly recommend doing this if you've never eaten here before This plate gives you a great sampling of what their menu has to offer and a generous portion at that It's easily enough for two people and at only around $12 a great deal tooOn my most recent visit I had the Gyro plate again amazing A very generous portion served with a delicious salad a side of rice and I topped the meal off with an Arabic coffeeHaji-Baba is not really a secret and the place will get very busy at lunch time If you want to eat there go for an early or late lunch otherwise you'll have to wait for a table it's worth itThey have a large menu and great prices and if you don't have time to stay and eat you can order to-go from the counterThe staff do a good job but their food is so good I'd still eat there if a server punched me in the face every time I walked in the doorIf you haven't tried it you need to go there If you have then you know just how great Haji-Baba is.
4595,0,Went in for lunch today and walked out after waiting 20 mins for a server to come to our table  No one came by no water no one to take our order nothing  Servers were either all yacking behind the counter or all 3 of them waiting on 1 table Everyone should skip this place and go to New Mexican Grill instead.
4299,0,I live in South Scottsdale My boyfriend and I are always in tempe and we would shop at this whole foods we loved the service there until last year we got kicked out of the store for no reason by the store manager claiming we vandalize his property yet he wouldnt show us anything on the video tapehe said he would call the cops on us if we came back for trespassing no such agreement between us the store and the cops when we did nothing wrong i want this issue to be resolved but i wouldnt shop there until they got a new store manager if anyone can help us out on being kicked out for no reason and what 2 do plz email me My boyfriend and I were kicked out last july for something that we still don't know what we did we made a complaint to the HR in texas they were doing an investigation and we havent heard from them back at all i was wondering does anyone know who the store manager at the tempe location is now I believed it was eric but i wouldnt be shocked if he got fired for that cuz he approached us off of whole foods property claiming we did something to his store.
1782,0,This place was a disappointment First of all the food took forever- even though my bf and I were the only ones there They have only 1 gyro on the menu C'mon now every greek restaurant should have more than 1 type of gyro My bf had the gyro and thought it wasn't bad despite the grease that poured out the bottom of his gyro when he held it up However when I order a gyro with beef only (no lamb) they didn't have it They also didn't have the beef sandwich When I ordered the Italian sandwich I was in horror when it came out It looked like soggy roast beef (that surprisingly tasted very dry due to overcooking) served in an old hot dog bun No joke the bread was an over-microwaved hot dog bun that was too hard to tear apart nonetheless bite through it It tasted as bad as it looked and I resorted to eating only my fries (which were overcooked and hard I think they re-cooked a batch that had been sitting out since lunch three hours before we came in) Who messes up fries This was a horrid eating experience that left me going straight to Mickey-D's for something more reliable Save your money people.
3240,0,This was an incredibly overrated restaurant We chose it because of high marks on yelp We started with mushroom soup which was salty brown water with a vague mushroom flavor We sent it back and got a beet salad which was fine To be fair my main course of trout was good The cioppino my son and husband had was the worst we had ever ordered It was supposedly a main course but was quite small The shrimp were tiny with a few pieces of shell fish and a very small piece of fish in a watery red broth without any character My son went next door to order a pizza so that he would have something to eat The bill was $12000 and we felt incredibly ripped off.
291,1,Moe and the guys are great at this location Have been going there for about 4 years since they opened this location.
3289,0,Went in one other party was there Their poppers were cold they said they could heat them up for me You don't heat popper they are double the price and half the size of Teharu in Scottsdale Surprisingly the iced green tea wasn't very good.
2807,1,This restaurant is what simple yet gourmet cuisine is all about You can't go wrong no matter what is on the ever-changing menu.
1829,1,Some of the best veggi/vegan food around & def the best here in AZ Are you unsure of what meat substitutes are or taste like  Green really nails it& their fake 'chicken' is seriously some of the best Ive had across the country ---- try the OG Poo Boy sandwich a spicy buffalo 'chicken' sandwich on a sub roll (so delicious) or I usually get the Ranchero Salad Buffalo wing style instead of BBQ  Seriously I cant go there without getting the Buffalo anything  Check out their new location in Phoenix on 7th st ---- with their dessert cafe next door 'Nami' you can get fantastic vegan pastries Soynami's (vegan version of Dairy Queens blizzard) cupcakes coffee & more SO GREAT +++.
3467,0,Waited 3hrs to sit 5:30 to 8:33 the worse system for seating Don't ever go.
2774,1,Local breeze is one of my favorite restaurants in the city  My bf and I go all the time for brunch and they also have really good burgers too  My favorite part about this place is that they have a dog friendly patio  They usually bring the dogs little dog bowls with water and sometimes even a cookie  Try the coca cola ham omelet for brunchAH-MAZING.
4160,0,"Overrated Overpriced Underwhelming The cashiers are nice and friendly but that's as good as this place gets Their sandwiches are pathetic They are also not worth what you pay for I recommend going to a better place for your foodI'm going to use my ""never again"" card for this one."
4316,0,I am very embarrassed I ate here So much so I didn't even photograph because anyone would think this was just a hate review I will start with my iced TeaI went to the iced tea dispenser and got splashed in the belly with cold iced tea The manager just laughed when she saw saw iced tea hit me in the stomach  but she did wipe it off the floor (yeah)I thought the packaged salsa looked better than the salsa bar salsa because the salsa bar salsa looked like it was just frozen tomatoes just brought outThe  chicken in my salad was so dry I don't think anybody body would come back for trying chicken here (In the salad anyway)And the tomatoes seemed like thawed  grainy frozen tomatoes and the dressing was just Mayo with a little green stuff in itIt was very bad foodsorry.
4851,0,"If you have to be some place on time don't use them  I called at 2pm for a 4:15 taxi to arrive  At 4:25 they were calling me saying he was right around the corner and gave me his location  Estrella called a couple more times to ""verify my address""  At 4:35 I called them and cancelled the cab and got a ride from my neighbor  As we pulled out of my neighborhood we PASSED the cab He had taken a street that he thought was going to be a through street and got himself lost This is a TAXI service they should know how to get around the valley  Don't these people use GPS or MAPS at least  End of story I was still late for my class that I paid 25000 bucks for I was not allowed in and the money is non refundable  So thanks Estrella wasting my time and costing me money  WORST TAXI SERVICE EVER."
3765,0,NoI said - NO.
563,1,The Fish Market has been here awhile and it is still going strongFor the price this is one of the finest seafood restaurants in the city I adore their clam chowder (white) and just about everything else on the menu That have a fantastic fish selection with several fresh catches to choose from The scallops are wonderful and the shrimp is sooooo freshThe staff is super friendly The manager let my daughters pet the lobsters (in fact he invited them to do so)Two thumbs up.
1517,1,Yes yes and hell yes  The food--I had veal piccata the small portion--was delicious and more than enoughMy friend got the large size veal parmigiana and she had to take more than half home for the next day  Her portion was that large so maybe it is smarter to get the large order for a little more and get 2X the foodThey put bread that's toasted with garlic and olive oil on the table first which was dee-licious  Obviously I totally blew the Atkins all protein diet with that bread basket but it was sooo goodI just love the food here so this is now my new go-to place for real Italian ***Keep up the good work at this location but you need to kick the 83rd Ave location and get them cooking like the 59th Ave location  I've eaten at both and they just are not the same:  different cooks make a difference.
577,1,This place is amazing Great trainers and an awesome community feel I can't imagine working out anywhere else.
1070,1,I am addicted to looking fabulous all the time Carmen makes my lashes long thick and beautiful I am a fitness instructor/ dance teacher and don't always have the time to put on make up in the morning Carmen does an amazing job Her prices are fantastic and her work is beautiful HIGHLY recommend her.
3869,0,I have eaten there in the past and has been a while  Food was very good when this restaurant first opened  Just went there 01/18/2014 I ordered the chicken dinner to go and it was the worst crap ever  First the cashier ran back and asked the cook if there was any chicken  I received 2 legs and  thighs which tasted and looked like it sat under a heat lamp for hours  For the price your paying u think it would be fresh  Quality has definitely went down  Will never again go to this culvers location again.
513,1,Fast friendly service and no charge for my first rotation and flat repair WOWED in Scottsdale.
2127,1,They may have the best pulled pork sandwich topped with delicious slaw in townEverything about this sandwich said finish me all and you'll be stuffed miserablebut you can give it a tryI might suggest they throw a little more fruit on the plate just to make it look like a decent attempt Otherwise I love this newly decorated spot and will definitely be back.
2625,1,Loved this placetook my mom for mothers day and we were there for 5 hours getting wonderful services and had lunch by the pool Cant wait to go back.
747,0,Worst pho I have ever had Rubbery beef crunchy noodles and tasteless broth Look else where for Pho.
135,1,I'm an investor in both residential and  commercial real estate  I've worked with Jason's team on a number of occasions and he's a top notch real estate professional  Jason identified several great deals for us and his knowledge of the local markets has been a huge asset on the leasing side of our business  I highly recommend Jason's services.
2509,1,I am transplant from Chicago where we know pizza like no one else and this place has the best pizza on the entire West Coast  One bite and I knew immediately no other pie can compare 2 thumbs way up.
57,1,I haven't had better pho anywhere in az the large pho is enormous for the price i usually go with my family and order a regular sized pho for myself and a number 45 (beef/rice plate) to share with another person the one down side of this place is that it's located in a little more run down area and the restaurant's cleanliness isn't that great nonetheless their food makes up for it i would definitely recommend this place.
2928,1,I've been trying out all of the chinese restaurants in the area and I think I've found my new favorite  Its right next to Church's chicken and I only found out of it because of the tiny sign out by the roadThis place doesn't look like much from the outside or from the inside  I don't think I'd want to sit down here with friends Its clean but there's always a TV blaring some show or news that would interrupt any conversation  Take out is probably the way to goI've gotten take out from here twice so far  The menu says specifically that soup is not included with the dinner combos for take out  Both times I ordered they included the soup anyway  The soup is very goodWe've tried Chicken Lo Mein Orange Chicken and Sweet & Sour Pork and all three were great  They give you plenty of food which is great if you like leftovers  They're about as fast as any other place and thier prices are great  There are a few other places that I dropped in to get menus from and I probably won't even try them after seeing this menu because they cost so much more.
395,1,This place is brand new clean and reasonably priced.
1504,1,Colin M did a masterful job filling you in on the facts about this business so check out his review  I can only second what he said  This is a real camera shop stocked to the gills with lots of top-of-the-line stuff  It would be easy to be intimidated but don't let that keep you from going into this fine establishmentI have bought a few things here and they have always been very helpful and friendlyYou can find better prices on the internet but no instant gratification on the internet  And who is going to help you with a problem or answer a question when you have one  Who will repair or clean your camera for you  No we need to support our local shops and if it means paying a few percentage points more it's worth it.
3841,0,"Please know that this is a DOG FRIENDLY restaurant  Even when the dog is aggressive or interfering with other customers they have preference over the humans My husband and my young son sat on the patio to enjoy the gorgeous weather  Unfortunately a couple with a huge hyperactive Pitt Bull sat next to them The dog kept bumping into my son's chair and even lunged at a waiter When my husband politely asked them if they could control their dog he was told that he shouldn't have brought his ""kid to a dog friendly restaurant""  Management was no help (maybe because one of the waitresses was friends with the couple-she kept sitting with them) so my husband and son had to leave (no available seats inside)  So we'll take their advise and never eat here again."
2902,1,My husband and I go to Alberto's often as we are locals  It's great to have a neighborhood place where you are greeted by name  Alberto the owner is a real gem and runs this charming and cozy place Ask Alberto for a wine recommendation he'll give you a great bottle in the price range that you ask for The warm homemade bread with homemade dips and great olive oil are a great way to start the meal The bruschetta is fabulous and a must-have starter  I also love the Artichoke salad it's very unusual and tasty with plenty of shaved parmesan My favorite entrée is the Fettucine Alberto- a cheesy tomato sauce over fresh homemade fettucini  The pastas are good sized portions and you will not leave hungry Sadly I'm not sure we've left enough room for dessert on our last few visits  Enjoyable meal cozy setting and great food.
698,1,Same 4 people had dinner here a year later  We thoroughly enjoyed this place again  We started with two orders of their chopped salad and it is outstanding  You would make a big mistake to go to this restaurant and not order that  Very unique dish tasty and just overall enjoyable  For our main course I had their Pork Shank and it was terrific  Huge portion with very tender pork off the bone with a nice bark type crust yet so tender  My friend had their stuffed Pork Chop and raved about it and the two wives split 3 small plates-0 was a small version of their mushroom dish another was scallops with a beet risotto (they liked this one the best) and the third was a sliced BBQ Pork with a picked slaw--nice mixture of sweet and smoky  They really liked all 3 dishes  For dessert the 4 of us split a dessert called cereal killer which was ice cream with frosted flakes brittle caramel sauce and an oatmeal cookie  Very good and plenty for the 4 of us  Our waitress--Patricia was outstanding  She was very knowledgeable about the menu and about the wine and seemed genuinely interested in our well being  She is a top notch waitress  We will be back again next year when we come back for spring training.
413,1,"So they pretty much have every flavor Tea imaginable hot or cold Had their Chocolate Mint Hot Tea and my oh my it was Devine  Not your typical ""tea shop"" as it has more of a modern feel  Not too crowded for being a Saturday night but enough people to know its worth walking into  Cant wait to try their pomegranate tea."
667,0,Worst location ever I just moved around the corner from this particular TB and am very unsatisfied with the service The people are relatively nice but the speed of service sucks It always takes at least 15 minutes to get your food in the drive thru and it is usually ice cold once I drive the 3 minutes to my house(edited below 4/23/13)The other issue I have i that every time I have visited this location they get my order wrong Not just a little wrong completely wrong Today the store manager came to try and help the incompetent employee mess up my order I decided it was time to speak up She never said sorry acted offended that I was giving her negative feedback about her store and proceeded to talk down and mock my concern  I was so upset that I banged on the window and demanded my money back I drove 15 minuted to the next closest TB NEVER AGAIN.
624,1,It's always perfect  Great Staff Great Management Great Food.
555,0,I wish I couldn't even give it one star my husband and I went in there for a quick bite before going grocery shopping We went to the counter we were not greeted for one two they all looked at both my husband and I like we don't belong in here because of our skin color and two they all spoke spanish not one drop of English I'm sorry but if you are going to work in a fast food restaurant in America you better start speaking our language I will never go to this one EVER again.
4419,0,I used to love Banana Republic  I stopped by at lunch to buy a few outfits I wasted quite a bit of time in this storeto an frazzeling degree  The choppy layout of the new store is annoying  The clothing line changed drastically so you look like you just came from an overpriced (and cold) beach  I was looking to dress sharp and professional not wrinkled and hap-hazzard  I wanted short sleeves not flimsy spagetti straps long sleeved blouses and SWEATERS (helloits JUNEand ARIZONA)  Banana Republic's new format and collection is a huge FAIL.
1439,1,This place is awesome Great food good service The happy hour cant be beat.
2682,1,First let me chuckle at the reviews that rate it low because it's busy or loud  FolksREALLY  Seriously you rate this place low because you can't sit right down on a weekend night you have some issues If an empty quiet place is what you are looking for Burger King and Harveys right next door to Blue may be the spot for you Okay first service is always top notch   The servers are great friendly attentive and most importantly  knowledgeable on ALL of the menu items Is the food gourmet  Nope it is a sports bar but personally I have not found a place that compares the quality and taste of the food at this place  I am not kidding there is not one menu item that I have tried that I haven't enjoyed  My personal favorites boneless wings grilled mahi tacos buffalo chicken flat bread pizza and pasta alfredo  This is by far my families and my favorite dinner spot and it seems by the crowds many agree with me.
2478,1,So peaceful So quiet So in tune with natureIf you want to escape the hustle and bustle of Phoenix or perhaps even forget you're in Phoenix at all but rather in Japan next to a roaring waterfall go here Buy some fish food and feed the Koi they will thank you for it :).
3814,0,My son ordered the Sweet and Sour Chicken along with the Shrimp Fried Rice which he enjoyed  My husband was not impressed with the Broccoli Beef  While I ordered the Hot and Sour Soup and the Hot and Spicy Lamb  The Hot and Sour Soup was mediocre I've had much better and the Hot and Spicy Lamb was extremely greasy  The quality of the meals is not what will keep up us from coming back  It was the fact that as we were waiting for our check my son noticed a cockroach next to my husband's shoe on the floor Which brought our attention to the reminder of the dining room floor and we saw another one  Totally gross.
4359,0,"Shame on me for going back here I haven't been since my last review and really wanted to love this place again If I could I would give negative stars now  I had not had a pedicure in about 10 months (I just had a baby and don't do pedicures while pregnant) I wanted to pamper myself a little I read another yelper's review and yes this is NOT a spa HOWEVER they offer these particular services and therefore they should be performing these services correctly and appropriatelyI went late in the day (got there about 75 minutes before closing) because I had to wait for my husband to get home from work but thought I arrived in plenty of time When I signed in the owner looked immediately at the clock At that point I knew I shouldn't have come in that late My fault there The gal came out and showed me to my chairbaby cockroach alive running around in the chair She brushed it off and it fell into the water where I was going to place my feet I understand there is a sandwich shop next door but why cockroaches in a nail place Also someone's dinner or lunch sat in a paper bag in the next chair over from me such ambianceThe nail tech watched the clock like a hawk to the point it made me uncomfortable She got done in a record time if 45 minutes She flew out the door in front of me as I handed her a tip I paid for a deluxe pedicure and think I was taken advantage of because there was nothing ""deluxe"" about it NEVER will I go back I don't know why I fooled myself into returning again Furthermore the paint chipped on one of my toes the very next day  As I said shame on me."

1672,1,My girlfriend and I stayed here this past weekend for a girls weekend away  I totally forgot to get an early check in so I called from the airport and they were able to do it no problem  Front desk and concierge staff was so friendly  Jenny sat down with us at length and helped us figure out hiking and eating  Our first evening they left champagne and snacks in our room as a happy birthday gift So sweet  The shuttle was great and the drivers nice and helpful  The pool was perfect and not too crowded on Saturday afternoon  They were very accommodating when we needed scissors bandaids extra bags etc  Our only complaint was no elevator as my friend had a huge bag since she was flying internationally for work from our weekend  Also - the location cannot be beat  Wouldn't stay anywhere else when I return someday.
3195,0,Besides the drinks i think this place is probably one of the most overrated restaurant in Phoenix And I actually like it's sister restaurant Postino Actually I think the owners are trying to ride the coat ails of its sister restaurants - LGO Postini and Chelsea's Kitchen  The menu has no imagination I was reading the menu and was trying to find something intriguing Perhaps I has high hopes as the owners are shrewd business people I should have just had a drink and went on my way But I gave Radio Milano a chanceRoman artichokes$10  The meatloaf dish we ordered was marginal The vegetable plate was so-so The housemade pasta tasted on par with chef boyardee  After spending $90I left with an empty taste in my mouth  Plus the dished are pretty small Only bright spot was that the service was good and the waitress was attentive But I go to restaurants for quality food not high priced crap.
2600,0,"How the hell you gonna trust a place to be authentic when they don't even know the difference between ""parmesan"" and ""parmagiana"" so they just combine them into a made up word (WHAT THE HELL IS PARMASANA)""Parmagiana"" is a style of cooking ""Parmesan"" is the cheese you sprinkle on your spaghettiGod People can be so stupid."
2308,1,FannnnnntasticFormerly Black Chile Mexican Grille Ling & Louie's Kitchen is wonderful Came here on a business holiday lunch and we simply had to sample everything We got the chicken skewers that came very well prepared with yummy dipping sauce too We also got a sushi roll which was good but nothing too exciting your basic sushi roll Also got the steak tip and blue cheese sliders and yeah they were as amazing as they sound The buns were like sweet table rolls and really melted in your mouth The extra bacon and BBQ was the perfect touch of sweet and saucy Finally we order the lettuce wraps too My boss said they were a tad satly for her but I thought the lettuce really complimented the spicey chicken and sauceFor lunch I orded the carne asada taco on flour shells Wam bam thank you maam They were fabulous The shells were so soft and chewy and tiny Freaking adorable The pico add these awesome kick that went well with the meet I wish there'd been more avadcado on each one but they were so tasty it didn't matterThe entire table truly enjoyed each other their meals and of course the staff and management were so kind and friendly to usGo here.
309,1,"Great place for kids  Don't forget to ask about the Junior Ranger activities  There is a small indoor nature center and a variety of hiking trails around a lake and the river  The trails are all very kid friendly  Various signs point the way and name the floraI find that the Junior Ranger activities help engage kids who look around and after ten minutes of hiking say ""What's next""  We usually go through three phases of Junior Ranger activity engagement  The first is antipathy  In the beginning it just seems to daunting  The parents start doing it and having fun  Then the second stage starts -- engagement achieved  Everyone is involved  Not only is the activity doable but it is fun  During this stage the family gets to explore the environs  After walking around the park there is usually just a narrative left that stands in the way of the kid and the reward  An insurmountable task during the first phase during the third phase get it done and get the reward it is completed in short order  Throughout the parents insert pearls of wisdom during obvious teachable moments  And at the end everyone forgets the first stage and agrees that they had fun the whole time."
1289,1,This local hole-in-the-wall is the best Thai restaurant in Avondale (well ok it's the only one) It easy to miss but once you find it you won't forget it The menu is a bit beyond the standard Thai eatery offering bold authentic Thai flavors If you love Thai food this is the place to go If you don't get Thai food this is the place to go For the spicy dishes they can make it as Thai as you would like or it The service is very good and the owner and staff make you feel very welcome You owe yourself a short trip to this humble great restaurant.

1331,1,Seriously the staff & Dr Marc are more than fantastic glorious dental care I was with them for 5 years before having to move to CA I was so sad to leave them behind I even had a filling that felt loose & emailed them within 3 minutes I had a reply When I did find a new dentist Sher're called to make sure I was doing well Very responsive caring and detailed Dr Marc is so delicate with you I have a serious fear of drills he let me turn up my ipod as loud as I could & made sure I was comfortable throughout All the hygienists & specialists are professional down to earth & genuinely care about your dental health.

3536,0,"I can no longer hold myself back from speaking out against this unscrupulous tire dealer Yes J J is a true professional but his boss Ralph the owner leaves a lot to be desired I started doing business with C & R Tire back in July 21 2009 I bought a set of 4 tires for my pick up I continued to buy several sets of tires from C & R up to July 2010 for my trucks We then started having tire failure problems and this is when the owner got involved and destroyed any hope of any future business from me The tires started to form bubbles on the side wall or the thread itself This is not just one tire but every single one we bought The last set failed this week So far I have replaced 10 tires that I bought from C & R over the time period all with the same defective problem bubbles on the side wall or thread Upon the first 2 occurrences I called C & R JJ put me on to Ralph the owner The answer from Ralph was it was not their problem It was a road hazard and we were not covered In his own words I will never forget this because I wrote it down ""You buy the lowest quality tire we have and you don't buy the road hazard protection what do you expect"" Basically he was telling me that his lower priced tires do not meet the standards of the road without the extra warranty Road hazards happened to all the tires I bought from C & R  I now buy my tires from another reputable and well know dealer in town and I can tell you that I do not have to worry about the tires they stand behind their products I have not had one tire failure from this other dealer All tires from C & R failed Can that be just a coincidence I don't think so."
1158,1,Now on my third time eating here since I found it a few weeks back and everything is amazing I a big fan of homemade middle eastern food an have been spoiled with it because family and friends would make it (my grandpa made hummus tabouli and falafel) this place does it right I have tried the gyro kifta hummus tabouli and more and it has all been great My true judge of a mid-eastern place is the hummus since I love it and have been making my own for as long as I can remember This stuff is great right combo of flavors and good bread to boot My only knock is it's a but creamier than I like and a bit less garlic(but I love super extra garlic so I can't hold that against them) Overall it's just right and I will devour it The meats are all flavorful and moist (especially rare with most other gyros) The tabouli is a nice mix of greens and wheat with a ton of fresh flavorsPlain in simple if you like mid-eastern food go here you won't regret it Try the combination meal and get a bit of all the good stuff.
1440,1,This Fry's Rocks  It used to be Smitty's when I was a kid so I have an instant love for it already simply b/c the location is nostalgic but beyond fond memories-- this Fry's RocksWe bought a Patio Set- round table and 4 chairs AND a 3 burner BBQ with a sauce burner all for $28900  Such a bargainNot only is this place a clean well kept grocery store they sell like real stuff furniture decorations lamps bedding the works  Anyhow I had a great experience here with today's bargains  Now we can have our own little backyard patio party who wants to grill.
582,1,Dolby Atmos In all reality this is a typical movie theatre like all the other Harkins in the valley However there is one thing that separates this theatre from all the other theaters Not only does this one have a Cine Capri but it is a Cine Capri with Dolby Atmos If you aren't familiar with Dolby Atmos and how it enhances a movie then I suggest you allow yourself a true audio experience.
378,1,After reading all the rave reviews about BLT Steak's happy hour I wanted to try it for myself Yelpers once again you have not failed me The rave reviews were spot on - this place is fantastic Boyfriend and I snagged ourselves a comfy spot on a couch next to the firepit on the patio The atmosphere is comfortable romantic and warm We were immediately greeted by our waitress who pointed out the happy hour menu They have several drink options and many food options We were there for the food and ordered a few items to share - the popovers (a must) the charcuterie plate the burger and the truffle friesHands down the standout of the night was the popovers They were huge fluffy and full of eggy goodness They are served with butter and salt - it's really all they need - yum But I added in some of the meat from the charcuterie plate and it was an excellent combo if I do say so myself Everyone who says get the popovers is right - get the popoversThe burger was very tasty A good size - plenty for sharing and cooked just right The fries were my least favorite I was excited by the description - truffle fries with parmesan cheese - but the fries were overcooked (too hard) and the truffle was overpowering Not my thing I guessThe service was really good too Even though you'd spend WAY more on dinner inside I never felt like I was part of the cheap crowd I felt like we were treated the same way we would be if we were dropping $200 even though we dropped less that $50 I appreciated that and it's smart because now I'm very likely to come back and blow a wad on a special occasion Well played BLT Steak I highly recommend BLT Steak's happy hour It was the dining highlight of my weekend.
4737,0,Have been an Ulta customer for a long time but had never tried the salon until recently  Was a HORRIBLE experience  My stylist Delia ran 45 minutes late to start me and on several occasions during the hair cut stopped and kept looking around  She made various odd faces as if to say my hair was a mess  She not only didn't listen to what I wanted but shot down the only thing I did ask for  She said I wouldn't look good  At the end of the painful ordeal she then charged me for a conditioning service I didn't ask for  At that point she directed me to the line at the front of the store after which I waited in they then sent me back to the salon to make the price correction  (happened twice then I asked for a manager)  Was very unprofessional all around and would NEVER go back.
139,0,If there was a NO star button I would have posted it I am not kidding when I say this place is a freaking nightmare I honestly felt like I was eating breakfast at the Drury Inn I soooo wanted to be excited about this place BUT I am extremely scared of this place First off it was Sunday and I was craving pumpkin pancakesSaw they had them on the menu via yelp Well no reg menu on Sunday's just brunch Ok fine $10 a person and you can get an omelet waffles (made to order cooking station) then the scary part There is a dining area set up with sliced deli meat potato salad (wtf) mini cupcakes and who cares what else I wanted to run for my life I ordered an omelet and all my veggies were raw in it Disgusting to say the least My waffles took forever cause they didn't spray the waffle iron so it stuck I don't have all night to write this review but I will not be returning for any circumstance.
576,1,I've been on a French kick lately  I spent last summer in France and am longing to experience it again  Checked this place out the other day and was really impressed  Authentic French food that is done almost as if you are in France which is a rarity to find here in the states let me tell you  I will definitely be coming back here on a regular basis and highly recommend it.
4501,0,1 star is too much to give this place as a review I was super excited to start my membership here and that quickly turned to disappointment My main complaint with this gym is there lack of policy for cutting locks off the lockers at night I can come into the gym at 2 in the afternoon with no one working out or in any classes and I'm lucky to find even one available locker People feel it necessary to lock their dirty stuff in the lockers over night and take up space for other members When asking the front desk what my options were they said i could pay an additional 25$ a month for a dedicated locker (people are getting them for free when they lock their lock all month) or i could place my bag with the front dest people to watch I've tried many times to get in touch with the manager Anthony i believe and have yet to receive a returned phone call or have yet to catch this guy while he's working to complain in person Called today again to ask for a solution to people abusing the locker system and was grilled but the preteen girl on the phone on asking the EXACT purpose i was calling rather than just taking my reason for calling as a complaint about the gym and keeping it at that I pay more more money each month to come to this gym over my old 24 hour fitness contract and drive way the hell downtown to use this facility The bi weekly payment schedule is a joke too seems all fine and dandy till you do the math and it comes out to about 43 a month after everything is said and done The lack of mirrors is annoying especially when you're trying to watch your formOver all i would give this place a half of a star because esthetically its pleasing but thats about it.
298,1,I had to run here on lunch to get my oil changed and 2 tires replaced before i left on a trip the next day to Flagstaff and i couldnt be happier  The people i spoke with over the phone were very accomodating gave me a great price and most importantly got me in and out on time to work  I really must say i will go back here again when i get my brakes done as well any other routine maintence im too lazy to do myself and back to the tires they beat the price on tires for the same tire everywhere else and had them in stock for me the same day.
1169,1,Best place in town.
3138,0,Very disappointing morning  Wanted a great breakfast but instead received NO service  Waited 10 minutes to get waited on - and nobody came over to even say hello  The place was not busy - 5 tables of people with over 5 staff available  Had to leave after nobody could even say hello  Sorry to saywon't be back.
4422,0,Sixty minutes after our reservation we were seated  N o other expensive restaurant I have ever been in ( NYC Europe San Fransisco) has ever treated us so shabbily  fish portions are half the size they used to be with higher prices  the waiters are actors trying to promote poor and expensive food with clever worrisome.
2500,1,Ice cream done my way Yes pleaseI love cookie dough but don't like Vanillaand this is the only place I can do thatThe staff is friendly the lines are never too long and I have yet to have a reason not to come backThe ONLY issue I have is I would like coupons more frequently Will not ding them a star but worthy of mentioning :).

3244,0,"WHAT ARE YOU DOING NO PICTURES YOU STUPID TOURIST BITCHOkay maybe she didn't say the ""stupid tourist bitch"" part but it was in her eyes Her eyes were like evil little pegs stabbing me in the heart I loathe you gelato scooper ladyWhat was I thinking taking pictures of the gelato sign outside I didn't realize I was breaking some secret gelato code: no photos of the gelateria or else ye shall be verbally lashed in front of ten(s) of people WE DON'T WANT PEOPLE TO HAVE PICTURES OF OUR GELATO YOU STOP IT NOWUm okay Why the fuck notYOU WILL TRY TO STEAL OUR RECIPESOh I get it I can deduce a recipe simply by LOOKING at gelato Wow I am a fucking genius YOU CAN HAVE PICTURES FROM OUR WEBSITEOkay now I am pissed off And I haven't had any gelato yet First she cockblocks my photographing skillz Then she tells me I may be a gelato-recipe-stealing thief And now she's ""graciously"" offering me pictures from their website as a consolation Gee THANKSBy this point I've mentally committed myself to hating their gelato And thankfully their gelato did not change my mind It was mediocre unflavorful and slightly watered down Hey gelato lady I didn't want pictures of your second-rate gelato anyway Take that."
3254,0,My wife and in-laws decided to try the North Phoenix Bill Johnson's out tonight to celebrate my in-laws anniversary  (My wife and I had never eaten there) We had been enticed to give it a shot after purchasing a deal chicken gift certificate  Fool me once shame on youWe were excited at the happy hour options and enjoyed a couple $1 beersunfortunately this is where the pleasantries stopped  After ordering we spent over 40 minutes looking around the 1/3 full restaurant for our food to arrive  At no point did our server Charlean apologize for the long wait or offer refills to my wife's soda  When the food finally did come it was cold  We would've mentioned it to our server but she didn't come back for 30 minutes to finally bring us our bill and at no point did she ask us if we need anything else or if the food was meeting expectations  I would've mentioned the experience to a manager but after the hour and a half in the restaurant I didn't really feel like asking around to figure out who the manager wasparticularly when we were trying to celebrate an anniversary  I spent year's in the restaurant business and I don't know which is the most disappointing - slow/cold food poor service or the inability to locate a managerregardless if this is the Bill Johnson's standard of service I will not be fooled twiceTaylor.
730,0,We had a meeting scheduled for Capistrano's to supply our restaurant with bread and buns  We waited over a half an hour before deciding we would need to reschedule  Later after we left the gentleman we had a meeting with called us   Instead of apologizing for wasting our time he proceeded to blame us for being late when we were 5 minutes early  After that failed he tried to blame the receptionist who tried at least 3 times to call his office twice on his cell phone and even sent him and E-mail  Apparently Capistrano's has all the customers it needs and isn't really looking for more  Take your business elsewhere.
2358,1,We got married here yesterday  It was beautiful and everyone loved the venue  Tasha was great to work with and there are just so many cool places to take pictures  We did a morning ceremony in late April  The only complaint I have is that where we had the ceremony (center courtyard) had only 50% shade  The groom's side was empty because everyone was huddled around the shady south side  I love living close to here so I can sneak a peek when I'm out walking the dogs.
1586,1,After my favorite wings place closed down (NY boyz subs n wings) I tried the next winner of the Wingstock challenge It's a little bit out of the way for me but it was well worth the trip there The chicken is incredibly crispy and juicy the mac and cheese bites are amazing The jalepeno poppers were my least favorite (honestly Jack in the box does it better) but the size of the jalepenos are hefty and well worth the priceThe honey biscuits are the BEST if I were to come back here again I would come back for the honey biscuits rater than the wings It was soft sweet hot and delicious It's a little bit on the expensive end but it's a good alternative from places like hooters.
2707,1,Service was great the place was kept really neat and clean And the food is authentic Great place to eat after a hangover or lunch.
4390,0,There are bees everywhere swarming the whole drive thru don't roll down your windows Truly Nolan is here but they are not doing anything to solve the problemThis was not a fun experience I pulled up to the drive thru window and bees swarmed into my car I kept yelling for the drive thru attendant to hurry and hand me my food and she was just starring at me through the window cause she was to afraid to open the window Meanwhile a plethora of bees let themselves into my vehicle I was so irritated at the whole situation I just drove off without getting my food I will never return to this place again I should probably seek legal advice since the drive through was still taking customers while knowing that had a swarm of bees in the drive through.
1444,1,I violated my rule of avoiding grocery shopping while hungry and decided to venture over to Whole Foods  Whole Foods tends to be the indecisive individual's nightmare (that would be me)  Yet this store is a foodie's dream There are aisles upon aisles of glorious wholesome products (pun intended)  Everything is meticulously organized and there are at least ten varieties of every type of item  No joke  It took me fifteen minutes to decide which brand of bottled tea would be suitable (and economical) I roamed the freshly prepared food section like a vulture circling it's preystrategizing which choice would be the best taste sensation  Did I want a made-to-order wrap  Or a glass of wine and a couple tapas (the live music was alluring)Maybe sushi  Pizza  Salad bar  Soup Maybe something from the smokehouseoooh A cupcake from the cupcake bar On and on it went My final decision was sushi The spicy tuna roll tasted fresh and the Pacific salad roll was very crisp I also grabbed a container of ginger for $199--not the artificially preserved pink variety--all-natural pickled ginger  Bliss  I purchased some cucumber salad from the salad bar as a side/palate cleanser All in all a very satisfying meal Prices are a tad higher than your average grocery store Then again it is Whole Foods A word of advise:  come with a game plan (eg a shopping list) If you don't define what it is you want prior to entering this store you'll end up spending two hours and twice as much money than you anticipated.
2029,1,Mas Vino I've been looking for another fun wine hang-out this may be it They have a huge selection of wine priced from $10 and up for a bottle (store prices not restaurant prices) They also have a vast selection of craft beers too Looking to have a glass while you are there - no problem They have 4-5 coolers of chilled beverages they have some non-alcoholic beverages too for the designated drivers Wondering about bringing a group The bar seats about 10 the various tables inside seat about 15-20 and then there is the big outside patiowith heaters mind you - that seats I'd say 15-20 plus lots of standing space so you can take turns with the seating if needed Food Selection is very limited for purchases you can get a little cheese plate for $10 It's a wine bar afterall but they seem to be cool with bringing in your own food so that's coolI was told on special event nights they do have a selection of appetizers though They have a TV behind the bar I'm sure you could talk the bartender into putting on a game etc when I was there a movie was playing Staff is nice our first visit we had Patrick helping us out behind the bar He also helped us to find a bottle of wine based on our needs and description so don't hesitate to ask there are so many bottles to choose from and they know their wine I'll be back Cheers.
790,0,First impressions do not mean a thing at this facility  I arrived for my first appointment and was forgotten Literally  they did not check me in After 30 minutes if waiting I asked for them to check how much longer it would be and instead of telling me they didn't check me in they take yet another 10 minutes to tell me At this point I ha e no choice but to reschedule because I have to pick up my kids I was told they would see me next month They still had the nerve I will NOT recommend this facility to anyone  It doesn't matter how shinny and new it is if they have crappy customer service it is a shame that I didn't get to meet the Dr She may be great but her staff is horrible.
423,1,If you're tired of the same old Pizza Hut Papa John's Dominos pizza all the time give this place a try Owned and operated by one person so its clear he doesn't advertise well or have a website and the place has a bit of a dull look To be honest I've never dined in here I always take my order to go The place is empty most of the time and it's sad to see he's losing all the business solely because of lack of proper advertising That's the only reason I can think of because the food is excellent I go here at least once a week The cheese they use is spectacular and the gyro specialty pizza is a must try TRY IT AND YOU WILL NOT REGRET IT I hope this place thrives because honestly I'd hate to see it go Btw for those concerned their meat is Halal.
3508,0,"This place has a cool retro chic thing going for it as far the interior is concerned but all the loveliness ends there   First off the entrance is kind of awkward  As soon as you walk into the ""bistro"" you are in the middle of the restaurant traffic pathway  It is a small place and you feel somewhat cramped and there was no host/hostess in sight  One of the bartenders greeted us and let us pick our spot (there weren't too many options) so we sat by the door  The bartender took our drink order (which by the way they only serve half bottles of wine but still charge full bottle prices) and then said the waitress would be right over to get our food order  We perused the menu several times and were still waiting on the waitress to come our way  She passed by us many times but seemed too concerned with the other tables  Finally we palce our order after the bartender had to tell her many times that we were ready  We split a salad and then placed an order of the Buffalo stax and the ""build your own"" beef stax  They never asked how we wanted them cooked and to be quite honest it did not dawn on us until we were eating them but mine arrived ""very well done"" and my boyfriend's arrived raw in the middle and burned on the outside  Needless to say we were upset but very hungry and ate what we could  I think the staff is too preoccupied with keeping a trendy Scottsdale image that they lack quality on the food and service level  It's quite a shame b/c the location is great and they would have no problem keeping regulars coming to an overpriced burger joint  I would never go back here again  The meal made both me and my boyfriend ill before we made it home (only 10 minutes away)If you want an overpriced but yummy burger then go to Deluxe Burger."
3216,0,I've had the same problem with this restaurant that others here have had The service is essentially non-existent and the food comes out cold/lukewarm and of low quality However spicy you make your food it's still somehow obvious that it's just not goodI recommend driving down the street to Tandoori Times instead The food service and experience is infinitely better.
2073,1,We love this restaurant Great service Freshest food in the west valley The pho is quite possibly the best I have ever had Try the spring rolls You won't be sorry Go therenow.
3956,0,The worst customer service ever  I once bought an item tried to return it unused with a receipt  They said the item was discontinued and I could not return it  I found the exact same item on the shelf bought it up to customer service and they still refused to honor my receipt  I have no control over how their computer rings up my item but I was being penalized for it  She said I could return without using a receipt but then I wouldn't get my full price paid  There is always some type of issue with their customer service The restrooms are unclean and there is seldom anyone around to assist or check you out  Apparently no one works at customer service ever unless I go to ask for help.
1544,1,Best Italian food I have experienced in Arizona and I was surprised because it's a chain My guy and I were ooing and ahhing throughout the meal I had the Lobster and Shrimp Ravioli with Crab insalata and it was a perfect portion perfect flavoring and al dente AMAZING The only thing this place needs is Spumoni (minus the candied fruit) Our server didn't even know what it was What i know.
354,0,Not good at all.
764,1,Love this place Only get to the Phoenix area once or twice a year and make a point to go to Old Pueblo My favorites are the carne asada and Mexican Flag enchiladas Love the fish tacos too Friendly service and reasonably priced as well.
734,1,"You must go hereWent during the ""Yelp Eats"" promotionEverything we experienced was remarkable The service food drinks and ambiance were all spectacularFirst the drinks There are numerous specialty cocktails an extensive wine list draft and bottled beers aperitif digestif single malt scotch and almost every type of alcohol you could expect Even unexpected libations that I rarely see elsewhere such as dessert wines We had to try their signature cocktails because it seemed to be the right thing to do at CPH Good booze & good bartenders can't let those go to waste We had to have something with gin so we opted for Aviation & Count Negroni Both were what we expected Strong & unique I don't see anyone disliking Aviation but Count Negroni is for specific tastes Try this if you like strong orange and cinnamon flavors The Campari in this drink makes a statementSecond the food We ordered the ""Smart Chicken"" and the Berkshire Pork Loin The chicken had a nice crispiness on the outside and had the flavor of lightly fried chicken without all the fat The risotto mushrooms and onions that came with it were amazingNow the pork The pork This experience made me fall in love with pork all over again We all love bacon but the bland white pork that comes from industrial farms has destroyed its reputation with people who love pork for its flavor not for its leanness Granted I have never had Berkshire pork before this visit but it was absolutely amazing They cooked it perfectly Pink and moist on the inside The meat was so sweet & tender and the fat was so flavorful This is due to the quality of Berkshire pork but also the proper preparation The stone fruit compote complemented the sweetness of the pork perfectly as did the pistachios The gorgonzola/white corn spoon bread was awesome And the broccoli rabe/chard (couldn't tell exactly what it was) was steamed perfectly with great seasoning and flavorThird the dessert The bread pudding was fantastic Like the best apple pie you've ever eatenonly better The ice cream that came with it was great as well I ordered a cup of coffee as well from Roastery of Cave Creek called ""Black and Tan"" One of the better cups of coffee I've ever had Even my girlfriend enjoyed it and it had no cream or sugar She usually loads up the sugar in coffee but she said that the coffee has so much flavor that it doesn't need anythingFourth the service Our server Brian was very knowledgeable and very courteous He answered every question we had gave us the proper attention and made sure we enjoyed our experience I can't remember a recent experience with better service than we had here at CPHOverall everything you want in a restaurant It's in a great location in the middle of Old Town Scottsdale I can't compliment this place enough Just go."

3777,0,Had THE MOST HORRIBLE experience at this hotel We checked in and left for the mall Came back to shower and get dressed and we noticed a few gnats Just ignored it thinking they came in with us having the door open because our friends were also staying there and were coming in and out of our room Next day my friend was in the shower and when she got ready to get out the toilet floor and sink were COVERED with gnats They had completly covered our toothbrushes and our towels She screamed and I went in the bathroom and ran back and grabbed my camera I took a picture and showed the front desk agent Lilian she said she would call someone 15 min later I walk back to the front desk and she is sitting on the couch in the lounge area talking on her cellphone UHHH Hello did you not just get a complaint and you're just taking this very lightly She then says shes calling the maintenance man (whom lives under the room we were in with a dog Were these gnats or fleas Whatever it was made my friend itch and scratch to the point where her skin broke out) Lilian came up to the room and when she seen them it made her skin crawl to where she started scratching Eventually the maintenance man showed up While he inspected the room we showed our friends 2 doors down and they also said they had seen a few also but not as many as we had The front desk agent tried to offer us a new room but if our room had gnats and our friends rooms had gnatswhy would we even want to stay there Who knows what other type of critters may be lurking in the bed sheets (Im itching as I type this) So we decided to pack our bags and find another hotel The next morning when we called to speak to them about our experience there we spoke to Andy the manager (who needs a class in customer service) he stated that we should have taken the room they offered us no refund and went back and forth with us and eventually hung up in our face We called back and he would pick up the phone and hang upPictures nextDO NOT STAY HERE AND IF YOU DO SHAKE YOUR BELONGINGS BEFORE YOU GET IN YOUR CAR.

3818,0,"Recently my Sam's Club membership under my former business expired and I was contemplating renewing on my own I had pretty much decided to renew once payday came around since I've been a member for 7 years and haven't had too many issues with the storeToday however changed my mind and I will be activating a membership with Costco I had purchased 4 brand new tires from Sam's Club last February About a week ago I noticed that my tire was low so I put air in it Then a few days later it was low againso I knew it needed to be fixed Without hesitation I drove to Sam's Club to have the auto center fix it since it was a tire I had purchased from there less than one year agoI run in to get out of the rain with my 4 month old baby and approach the service person at the counter who was definitely not wanting to be working or something didn't even greet me and acted like I was bothering him I tell him the scenario and he scans my Sam's Club card Of course it didn't come up since my membership has expired and I haven't had a chance to renew yet Immediately he informs me he can't help me and that's it So I say ""But I bought the tire from you Really You're going to send a woman with a baby back out to drive in a downpour with a flat tire not even offering to put air in it"" The utter disregard was unbelievableSo there you have it I cannot fathom doing business with a company with such horrible customer service."
4621,0,"First the couple good parts: the docs have always been nice and fairly competent unfortunately i've had a different one every single time i've been there so I don't have any loyalty to them the technicians have been fine as wellBut the rest of the staffyikes They are incompetent and downright rude (they were talking crap about me other customers other employees in earshot of everyone) I tried explaining that the doctor told me I could go home call them and tell them the brand features etc I was already wearing and then they would finalize my prescription The ""lady"" I was passed off to then 1) pressured me to buy contacts from them rather than online and 2) when I refused proceeded to make it as difficult as possible for me to get contacts from anywhere else Despite what the doc said she said that I had to come back for a trial pair because they didn't have any in stock (great) then I'd have to come back a third time for a follow up Ridiculous They didn't get the trials in for over a week I finally made it back in two weeks after that After more arguing I convinced them to let me have a follow up right there and then because I was already wearing the contacts I wanted and this time I brought the actual box and contact case with all the information so I didn't need the trial pair Doc approved I grabbed my contacts lens Rx and bouncedI also needed new glasses but I wasn't giving Nationwide any more business so I went to a Lenscrafters At Lenscrafters they needed my eyeglass Rx (Nationwide had only given me a copy of the contact Rx) so they called Nationwide Nationwide refused to turn over the prescription unless I faxed a release which of course took them a half hour The lady at Lenscrafters was stunned She had never had to do that and didn't even have a release form because most places will just fax the prescription over no problem By the way you're not a nationwide chain so your name is stupid Never again never again."

4167,0,Was so hungry came across this place while walking to the mall The wonton soup was hideous  The broth was decent but the wonton another story The wonton wrap was way too thick very overwhelming and the stuffing had no flavorHot Spicy Szechuan Lobster: for it being $22 it tasted like crap too much badder can't even taste the lobster Sizzling Black Pepper Beef: presentation was nice however the beef was super dry It actually tasted like old meat I even think Panda Express meat taste better and it's 1/3 of that price.
3312,0,Food was ok nothing to tell my friends about If your in the area come but not a place to say lets go eat at Bitz-ee.
3064,1,I wanted to hate this place  There isn't that much parking  It is packed with only a few big picnic tables to sit outside and eat  It was to hot to eat outside IMO which meant I had to take my sandwhich to go  There were only 4 sandwiches and 3 salads to choose from  One dessert they were sold out of  The price was high- $8 for a sandwich with no sidesHowever once I took my first bite of the tomatoe basil mozzarella sandwich I was in HEAVEN  The perfect amount of each ingredient  They have perfected the sandwich  I have been craving it ever since  I will stop by for lunch EVERYTIME I am in the area  I will bring everyone I know to eat here  Seriously.

3059,1,I believe this is the bigger of the 2 shops here in the valleyThey even have a cafeso for those of you who miss Boarders This is just as nice  Huge parking lot in mesa also very busy place                                        They really do have any type of book that you could want  Tapesvideos Dvdsgames for all sorts of players    The housewares dept is also quite good with huge amounts to choose from        The staff is friendly as well   As Michalel said it is also great to be a part of the recycling             You can take in all sorts of things for trade as well The trade is better than the cash                                                                                                        When you need anything in the media dept this is the place to go.
2964,1,We had a late night meal here after going to pick up a drunk from Nascar The Staff was more then excellent man did those young guys have the customer service skill down They asked all the right questions the register while ordering offered to refill drinks for an elderly couple cleaned and wiped tables for people I was impressed The food was standard 5 guys which is one reason to continue to go here Quality and consistency While I think 5 guys is an average burger I gave the extra stars for the staff here.
2288,0,I had a terrible experience at this shop-The owner is rude- my work was not done on time- I was yelled at and accused of having an expensive handbag- she ordered me to pay in advance- I think she is a nut- she did not call me to tel lme my dress would not be ready- it wa a special occasion stay away.

3842,0,Worst sushi Ive had in Arizona The egg drop soup was old and tasted like feet Then our sushi took almost an hour and tasted like it had been sitting the whole time The sushi was so bad after one bite I was afraid to eat anymore for fear of getting sick At this point I told the waitress about how bad it was and all they did was drop a bill I will never eat there again and recommend nobody else does Ever.

2891,1,I was totally impressed with this place It is super clean tons of machines several change machines and even games to keep the kiddos busy The woman working (didn't catch her name) put all of my clothes in the dryer for me so that was awesome I saved so much time and was able to get some errands done I would recommend this place to anyone who needs to use a laundromat once or every week.

3202,0,What-a-disaterMy very first experience at a Whataburger and I can not believe the variety of ways they managed to screw it upI was the only person ordering but this place was such a disorganized chaotic mess that ordering a meal took a solid 5 minutes and required two employees and a ManagerI got my meal and immediately realized that they'd gotten my order wrong OK less fries and a larger drink are probably fineBut I got a jalapeno and cheese burger and the cheese isn't melted the jalapenos have no kick and the whole thing is smothered in the cheapest most repulsive American style mustard you've ever eatenI check out the fries and realize there is a 1 to 1 ratio of salt to potato I have to roll them in a napkin just to make them palatableAnd the strawberry shake tastes like a cold chemistry experimentI hate wasting food but I looked at each item and had no interest in any of it so I gave it back to them and asked for a refund The Manger didn't hassle me about the refund and I considered a second star but the food was just too bad to justify it2013 
4610,0,Subways are supposed to be very uniform but this was not The meat was mediocre nothing tasted fresh at all And to top everything off the employee insulted me and my clothes and was hitting on my sister It was a very unpleasant experience.
601,1,My husband and I LOVE this place  The food is amazing the service is great and the prices are reasonable  Every time someone comes into town to visit we take them to Dick's and every person we've taken there have loved it  Highly recommend.

286,1,Half side of the market is filled with hot ready to eat meals I'm so glad I came in here I'll never have to cook for myself again ).
3010,1,I have been going to this place for a few years now The food is great it is grilled with light seasoning and goes perfectly with warm flour tortillas You might want to avoid going at lunch time because they are super busy and it is hard to get a seat If you work in the area call ahead and pick it up.
4405,0,Like the other reviewer said if you show up to the actual shop you'll be attended by a jerk Next time I will just have the van come out to me instead of going to the actual store I don't know what is wrong with that guy Stay away from the store.

2089,0,My 10 year old ordered the chicken - after taking a bite and saying it tasted funny - I looked to see raw chicken - took back & complained - gave us a second order which ALSO came out partially raw  They didn't even check the 2nd batch  after a lame excuse and a manager that had no clue what to do we left -  DO NOT order chicken  Hoping my son doesn't get sick tonight.
2735,1,This place is worth checking out So good I usually get the chicken pho But everything is great The staff is super friendly as well I've tried other places for pho but always compare it to Tea Lite Cafe's Hard for me to go anywhere else.
896,1,Bought the Groupon for 15 visits and have loved it This is a great place to get a good sweat on Len the owner always mixes up the exercises and comes up with creative new things for us to try The workouts are circuits- you rotate through stations and do each exercise for about 40-60 seconds I like that because just when my mind starts to tell me I can't do it anymore the bell rings and I know I only have ten more seconds that I need to push through Each day of the week has a different focus:Monday- combo day (whole body workout)Tuesday- focus on chest/shouldersWednesday- butt/legsThursday- biceps/tricepsFriday- absSaturday- combo dayYou have to sign up for classes online ahead of time which has actually turned out to be great accountability for me- I know that I have to go because I will be charged regardless plus I took someone's spot (don't worry you can cancel up to an hour before if something comes up) Overall this has been a great experience and a great way to get in shape The other girls are nice and everyone is so focused on their own exercise that nobody judges anyone else I would highly recommend Jabz.
4527,0,Overpriced Stay away  Got charged $350 and they pushed a button to reset my tripped switch  Saw this on 2 FIXIt and thought it would be a good company but read these reviews and STAY AWAY  It's all about money and getting all they can once they get into your home.

3349,0,"Review for RIP SURFER CLASS  I just want to clarify that this review if for the Fitness class and is in no way a reflection of the spa  I have been to the spa in the past and it is a beautiful first class experience  Unfortunately I cannot say the same of the fitness classA bunch of girlfriends and I decided it would be fun to try out a new workout  There were 9 of us and we made a reservation ahead of time for the Rip Surfer class  Here is the description:""SurfSet reinvigorates the typical cardio and weighttraining routine by fusing all the elements of surfing into a high intensity fat-burning session  SurfSet shakes things up continually challenging the body with dynamic angles a fast tempo and an unstable surface""I'm really sad and disappointed to say that the ONLY thing true about this description is the unstable surface  There were two instructors that evening and they started by splitting us up into two groups  One group did the surf set and crank while others moved to another room to do TRX  Then we swapped  The class was supposed to be 60 min long  I don't think we got a total 60 min workout  Between explaining things and moving all around  We may have gotten a 45-50 min workout  Additionally we wanted to do this experience as a GROUP  Which is why we signed up as a GROUP-- not to be split upWe may have gotten 20 min of actual workout on the surf boards  The rest of the workout was done on TRX and Crank machines  I did not pay $20 to workout on machines that I could use at my regular gym  I paid $20 to try a new workout  The workout itself was NOT at all high intensity  Not to take away from the instructors who were very fit for their age but we were a group of 9 women who work out regularly  There was not a single person who found this workout to be physicially challenging or exciting  It was unorganized mundane and quite frankly a waste of time and money in my opinionBeing that the Princess is a top tier spa our expecations were set higher  Between the $20 and $5 spent tipping the valet (because self parking was no where to be found and by the way- the valet guy actually tried charging me $8 for parking also)-- total expense for this ""experience"" was $25  Again the spa is fabulous and I would go back but this Surf class was a total joke and I will not be returning  Terribly disappointing because it seems like a really cool concept and it is not offered in many places."
509,1,Great nom noms in my tom toms I got the gyro It was loaded with meat and very delicious Not like some places where the meat is dry and lacking in flavor  One of the best gyros I've had Added plus its a small locally owned business and the owners are quite friendly.
4685,0,in from the Midwest staying in old Scottsdale  nice town great shops to stroll through took three friends to eat and wanted Mexican food  close to the border so it should be good  right NOT   fajitas wernt hot  didn't sizzle at all  Mexican pizza bland with little flavor  the lady got a burrito and they charged for all the sides that was to come with the order entrée and for a 102 pound lady I thought that a 1550 meal was ridiculous  when it was to be 850  top shelf margarita was half the size of the same price as at home and wasn't as good  mi pueblo real in IOWA is ten times the food of this place  and im a concrete contractor so im not a cook and could  do better with bag food from walmarts or frys cold frozen section  sorry if you eat here.
4576,0,"This place is a dive  My husband and I tried it for the first time this morning and the food was TERRIBLE  The only thing we received that was hot was the coffee  I ordered a glass of water coffee and eggs Benedict  First the water tasted like it came directly from the tap not at all filtered the Benedict  was mildly warm along with cold ""hash browns"" (these are really chopped potatoes with no seasoning)  My husband ordered iced tea corned beef hash with hash browns sourdough bread and a pancake on the side  His tea tasted like lipton nothing special and all of his food was barely warm  The toast was so cold the butter didn't even melt I could not believe that the waitresses that walked by did not say something  The pancake tasted like it came out of a box and the corned beef hash was straight from a can  I do not understand how this place is still in business  The prices are way to high for the poor quality of food that is served we paid over $30 and I left feeling like I had food poisoning  We will never return  If anyone is looking for a good HOT breakfast check out Biscuits on Elliott and 48th St on the West end of the Safeway parking lot or The Nosh on Warner and 48th St."

1491,1,Went there last night with a group Everyone really liked the food and the service was excellent We shared 5 different dishes The lamb masala was particularly good as was the tandoor chicken tikka  This is the best Indian food we have found in the valley (our group has been to many Indian restaurants in England Canada and elsewhere) The decor is a little plain but is clean and new.
4180,0,This is normally our fav place to eat - normally good sushi and great crab legs Normally last night EVERYTHING had been out for too long The sushi rice was hard the crab meat was grey inside the legs Service at the table was great but the food was horrible  We likely won't return.
2021,1,My recent trip to Snowbowl had a bus breakdown half way through Of course not DSC's fault as anyone can have a breakdown but still made us lose time & they had to deal with a bus full of unhappy customers They handled it very professionally provided partial refunds and discounts on the next trip They provided extra beverages & did a good job at making a bad situation better They played movies up & back and all in all it was pretty fun I'll never drive to snowbowl again - this is a great service and I for one will tell all my ski buddies about it Sure the staff is young - but they're also alot of fun too Thanks guys.
3439,0,"""Lowering Cane's expectations"" should be the nameThey have just set the bar low on food quality and taste  No seasoning at all in the breading of the chicken fingers and the fries seem like they came straight from your grocer's freezerMust not have thought much of their dog if this is their tribute to him  Just drove away disappointed  Want my junk food to taste good if I'm going to splurge with this type of caloric intakeOnly positive was stellar Drive-Thru service and the place seemed pretty cleanDon't waste your time."

302,1,Delish Enough said Marcella's has made me fall in love with Italian food all over again Great prices and amazing food We ordered 15 dishes for our office and I can't complain about one From the Chicken Parmesean to the Layered Lasagna down to the garlic cheese bread and apple salads I was impressed with the flavor and presentation of it all  The restaurant is great for small and large parties or even a pickup order The staff is extremely helpful and friendly and very knowledge in their menu For those who are watching the carbs and a lil bit of a health nut they do have alternatives (gluten free pasta etc) As for their happy hour its great Half off their wine sangria (red & white) and their house pizzas which I might add are large and tasty Take boys if you're looking for a great locale for a date this is the spot the decor and ambiance is great.
1915,1,"Oh my How have I NOT reviewed this place yet It is amazing This is in the top 2 of my favorite restaurants in North Phx (the other one is Bamboo Grill) If the man is there he is the best Always happy to see you and ready to chat while he cooks I have gone in here with my mom and sister with just me and Hubs and with my 2 little ones Every time the food is fantastic If it's just the girls working the service pales in comparison to when the guy is there but the food makes up for that Try the tortilla soup Made right there in front of you and ohhhh sooo good Hubby and I always share the fajitas classica mmm I think that is the best way to go And they are more than willing to give you extra of whatever you ask for And if you throw in a dollar for them they ring the bell and yell ""AYYYY"" lol Also good prices especially if you split something which is totally doable since their servings are huge."
106,0,F@(& this place  I called several times today to check in on a phone order that should have been delivered a few days ago  The 1st time I called the kid who picked up the phone was a rude little prick and he put me on hold never to come back  I then called several more times only to have their answering machine pick up  I finally got someone on the phone and they tell me that they have no idea when the phone will be there which is really messed up because it has been paid for and when it was ordered they told me the date it would be shipped and the date I would get it  What gives  Never use this place  They should have their contract canceled  Its little shtty stores like this that make Verizon customers switch to other carriers.

918,1,After reading the reviews about this place I just had to go and check it out There was alot of people but not overcrowded it was alot of families and there kids The food was awesome I had the fundido with jalapeno cream cheese and it was so good It had this awesome unique taste to it where you just couldnt stop eating even when full This was the only place that makes there mexican rice exactly like my moms It was delish You can tell there refried beans were very authentic Ive been to alot of mexican restaurants and this one is by far the best.
3015,1,Great food in a hole in the wall place  Don't let the atmosphere deter you  We are from SLC Utah and found this place on Yelp It had four tables so is small but well worth it  They had a Mexican telenovela (soap opera) on TV while we were there but it was quiet  We had tacos and huevos rancheros with beans and rice all of the food including salsas were great  To drink we had the Mexican apple soda so tasty  Give it a shot.

4402,0,This place is AWFUL NEVER take your car to Big O Tires I took my car in at the recommendation of a friend to have my tires replaced after getting hot tar on them (Darn Arizona summers) They convinced me to buy all 4 new tires I leave and have to return TWO more times to get the car properly balanced The 3rd time I was there they told me that they only had 1 guy who could properly balance my car and he wasn't in that day and to come back tomorrow I brought my car in the next day to get the car balanced AGAIN and get an oil change They told me they didn't have time to do the oil change and I'd have to come back AGAIN to get it done It also took over an hour and a half before they even looked at my car despite making an appointment They were quite rude both days as if it was my fault the car wasn't balanced right They finally got it right the third time and I have never been back I would not suggest ANYONE take their car here EVER.
470,0,What a shit heapThe sound is awful the food is awful and anything edible or potable is grossly overpriced even by venue standardsDespite the fact they have two huge projection screens you'll be lucky if they have one of them working much less bothAnd the tickets Dear lord the tickets If you've going to pack us like sardines into a 100+ degree venue without even the courtesy of breathing room lay off the ridiculous prices and magical feesThere are about a million possible venues in Arizona at which I'd rather see a show than Cricket and that includes a damp cardboard box on the corner of Van Buren.
2087,1,What a great place for lunch The pecan grove makes for a really nice setting for a picnic and/or a party and they do have them there The food is very good The Grilled Chicken BLTDA Sandwich Curry Turkey Salad Sandwich and the Farm Fresh Seasonal Sandwich are all incredibly awesome sandwiches.
161,1,"I came here last night with m'lady and two of our closest 'foodie' friends and I must say we were very impressed with Little Cleo's The new gem of the Sam Fox empire lived up to my expectations and then some in terms of ambiance service and quality of foodWalking in the restaurant is smallish with seating at tables and bar stools The first thing I noticed are the oysters - boom - right in front of you on display and labeled from location After settling in you start to get a 'San Francisco' type vibe in the atmosphere with the 40's music white tiles open kitchen etc (dare I say it - I know Bay Area natives will probably turn up their noses at that as they do for every thing else)You absolutely cannot come here without getting the oysters don't even think about it Second do you like crab Well they have a ""Warm jar of King Crab and butter with grilled bread"" - verbatim that is what it says on the menu I want to die eating a warm jar of king crab and butter that is how good it was Lastly you have to get the frog legs Don't be a wuss sack up and eat them They are delicious super tender and have an incredible Thai chili sauce We ate everything family style I recommend you do the sameTop all of it off with great service from our server Casey and you have a fantastic seafood dining experience in Phoenix Oh and don't forget to buy the kitchen a beer for $2 before you leave."
2129,1,If you have someone in your life that has celiac or any type of wheat or gluten allergy this is the place  Their bagels waffles and herb bread are works of art made with love i don't know how they do it and I don't really care I just LOVE that they DOThe waffles are my favorite and my girlfriend that has severe celiac is obsessed with the bagels  She told me this is all she wants for her birthday forever The noodles that look like egg noodles are a little mushy when cooked so I won't be getting those again but I was going to fill up on bagels and waffles anyway.
1032,1,We were one of their first ten customers when they opened the downtown Glendale location I was so excited to see them in North Glendale  It's not fancy but you get great food at reasonable prices Their red tamales with sauce are to die for My favorite chorizo is still Carolina's  but they run a close second hereThe carne asada rocks.
2499,1,My new favorite italian spot  Loved it  Talked about it for days  We ordered a ton of food-- Calamari was awesome spinach ravioli and caesar salad were perfect  My husband had two beers a ceasar and an entree as well  Our bill was only $60-- totally worth it Service was awesome they made us feel like family.
3881,0,"Can't believe this place is still in business  We went to the Harkin's Theater for an evening movie and decided to have a later evening dinner after reverse of our norm   Upon leaving the theater we quickly realized that we would have to walk somewhere to eat dinner since the roads in the vicinity were in gridlock the Peoria Stadium had just finished up their 4th of July festivities  We were quite happy to see Johnny Fox's Public House on the end of the parking lot  The outside of the building looked inviting so we decided to try it  We were greeted by a very nice blonde hostess who quickly brought us to a cozy booth in the bar area  As she sat us she handed us 3 regular menus and 3 ""late night"" menus (it was 10:05pm)  I excused myself and went to the restroom (which was far from clean)  On the back of the stall door and by the sinks I noticed posted signs that discussed their happy hour and times 10pm being ""Reverse HH""  Right after I sat back down at the table the hostess began picking presentation signs up off of all the table  I noticed it was the HH signs  Hmmm  About that time the server came back to our table and said ""Sorry the kitchen has taken down their line for the regular menu we only have the late night menu"" and he removed the menus from our table  I then asked about the HH  He said that they didn't do HH on holidays (not stated on the flyers table menu or even their website that I looked at later)  Since we needed time to look at the alternate menu we asked for a few minutes to decide  I looked around and other tables that were just being sat were still being given the standard menu even though by this time it was well after 10  We asked to speak to the manager  A dark haired man in a cheesy royal blue jacket came to our table side  When I told him our concerns and said we would not be ordering anything else and would like to pay our check (my husband had ordered a drink) he just said ""I'm sorry you feel that way  would you like me to take care of that for you"" (meaning our bill)  I figured he would at least give us HH price on the 1 beer but no instead he ran our credit card for the full amount and brought it back I have to say we go out to eat about 3-4 times a week and with all of the wonderful restaurants to choose from in the Phoenix are we will not make the mistake of going to Johnny Fox's Public House ever again."
4938,0,Went there today to have my favourite beer and maybe some fish and chips - the place is closed with a chain and padlock round the door handles - closed for good I understand.
4659,0,My wife and i went for lunch the service was so bad 15 minutes for a server to ask what we needed her words ( what do you need to drink) told manager the service was bad he said well maybe next time it will be better sorry and just at this location at the chandler mall.
3863,0,Picked up dinner with my mom on 8/28/13 The chicken nachos had a very long piece of black hair in them She pulled it out right before my eyes Totally repulsive She called the restaurant & the guy offered to remake them When she explained we lived about 30 minutes away and no one felt like eating chicken nachos anymore not even an offer of a refund Didn't even seem concerned that employees were sending out food with their hair in it Gross.
3977,0,What a disaster  I don't get the love of this place at all  I'll agree with Patrick L on this one: William-Sonoma with a hot case  That's all this is  Where do I beginFirst - the layout  This design might be nice when one or two people is in the store but on a Saturday afternoon this place had 30 people in it and was insane  The layout does not help  Not only are there three sets of lines that merge into each other creating all sorts of pile-ups but there is no where to go that you aren't in the way  Racks of food act as line partitions more than they act as display cases  It is really a nightmareSecond - quality for the price  It is a ton of high-end stuff and that's okay  I have no issue with high end products but  where the hell do you get off charging $5 more than some place like Delicious Dishes  I can get the same products at a LOCALLY OWNED store for significantly less  There is nothing special about what you stock  You don't make these cheeses yourself  These aren't your livestock being slaughtered  You get this stuff from the same supplier that AJs Trader Joes and Petit Fromage do yet you charge like you're the only game in townFinally - You call that a deli counter  The girls working here have probably been using a meat slicer for 2 months and couldn't tell you the difference between mortadella and sopressata  I'm sure they don't know how to cook it and can guarantee that they don't know proper pairingsNo thanks  I'll stick with Delicious Dishes in Phoenix and keep my money local.
1,0,"I went to this Petco a few times and was a bit appalled at their rodents section to be perfectly honest Granted it wasn't as bad as it could have been but in my opinion it was unacceptableFor one thing there was six or seven rats packed in one cage that was what    1' x 9"" 1 x 8"" Don't quote me on that - I'm not 100% sure but regardless of the details it was way too small for the number of rats that were in it They weren't unhealthy they didn't look very sick but they definitely didn't look particularly healthy either The guinea pigs were what really shocked me though If you know anything about guinea pigs you'll know they need a lot of space - even just for one This cage was the same size as the rat's cage (they all were) They barely had enough to room to walk much less exercise or popcorn (which my guinea pigs do often) There were two guinea pigs packed in that thing when it was way way too small for one baby guinea pig It also didn't look that clean - all the cages in my opinion were grungy The whole place felt grungy and grimy And they obviously weren't cleaning the cages everyday which they should be doing It would be more unfair to the animals to do anything but at least a small cleaning each dayThe prices are indeed pretty good or at least better than the prices at the Petsmart I usually go to so there's one point for Petco At last the employees Are they nice and cheerful Yes That is until you politely point out that the guinea pig cage is way too small for them to be healthy and happy (I was trying my hardest to be polite although I could have come across as rude) they (or the one I talked to) immediately turn defensive telling you ""it's very temporary"" and ""we take them out every night"" (which I don't believe but maybe a Petco employee can correct me on that) and make a face at you not once telling you they'll tell their manager (even if they won't) or you may be right like a good employee wouldWant your customers to come back Here's a good tip: don't tell them they're wrong about something and rudely correct them obviously trying to rush them out Humor them even if they are wrong about somethingOverall I would recommend not shopping here They don't take good care of their pets and their employees are rude if you care about the animals when they plainly don't Good prices They don't make up for thatI apologize if I made this too long and thank you if you read all of this regardless of whether or not you agree with me."

4080,0,I have been to Someburros one other time Food was just ok I decided to today to try their breakfast burritos After waiting for 30 minutes they had forgotten my order and then lied and said that it takes a long time to cook chorizo She speaks to the cooks in Spanish to make my order and then turns to me and states said that it was not her fault then whos fault would it be Blame it on the cooks Avoid this place Poor service awful food and employees who blame others and don't even apologize when they make a mistake Eek Me thinks not.
1778,1,These folks are doin' DD RIGHT.
1985,1,An oasis of little kid fun in Phoenix we hadn't been in over a year and came for a birthday party  They're always running a deal so look for one before departing  One year we did an annual pass  It was a good deal  There are also lots of special events that include deals  One time we met spidermanThere are lots of rides mostly for shorter kids  Some have modest height requirement that exclude the very young and some that exclude the tall  There's a train carousel mini-coaster tea cup ride an up and down parachute ride several rides that go in circles in different vehicles (eg planes cars and helicopters and futuristic flying machines) and a bumper boats ride that turns into a splash pad in the summer  Determining whether the adults need a wrist band or tickets is always a little tricky as adults are needed on some rides but not others and it also depends on the age of the child  The place has a little bit of a rundown feel but kids don't notice and have loads of fun  The arcade is really rundown but the ATM is really nice  There isn't much shade so be prepared  All of the staff are really niceThere are usually a few game and art vendors about: ball toss game sand art and/or face painting  All are a big hit with the kids but also hit up the wallet for a few bucks a piece  Everyone is a winner at ball toss by the way.
3233,0,Just walked in to grab a few bagels There were two people working One guy who knows what he was doing the other lady was prepping a bagel There was one other Patron so it wasn't busy by any means The lady prepping the bagel didn't even acknowledge us as we stood there for 5 mins just on the other side of the counter Good customer service tip Say hi and you will be right with you We got nothing and left We will never be back She didn't even make eye contact.
3259,0,This place is tired on every level Staff is polite and friendly but thoroughly inefficient and clueless There's a cute hotel around the corner called Clarendon just go there and enjoy life )Back to the 'Hilton Garden Inn': interiors are dated to say it polite the 'bar tender' is more interested in watching some football games on the TV screen the breakfast room staff on weekends just sits there doing nothing even when you're the only customer (note: the staff during the week is different they're good) Check in is delayed way beyond 3PM I've ordered a taxi to the airport on my check-out day: they did order one but managed not to tell me that it's actually here for 20 minutes And so on Never again - NOT recommended Ah and well they don't reply to emails either.
4033,0,Food is terrible Ordered a rueben and what I got was burnt soggy bread with tsp of cabbage slaw and rubbery deli meat  Service was lacking even though the restaurant was empty on a busy Saturday at the Mall  (should have been a warning) The manager erased the bill but left me lacking for a real rueben.
2901,1,this is a great place for Sushi and food Its always fresh and the food is also very tasty The rolls taste fresh and the pieces are well portioned they have a great happy hour Good prices and selection also great drinks  :) The cook will also come out and greet you He'll make sure you are satisfied I also had Ro as my waitress and she is just AWESOME I highly recommend this place Overall VERY SATISFIED.
1588,1,The food here is extremely good and the service has always been impeccable  The one time something came out that was sub par the waitress apologized profusely and removed it from the bill  Once they also accidentally brought the wrong pizza but quickly corrected it and comped it  Great atmosphere and no snobbery Fast friendly service at lunch time.
3188,0,I've been here a total of 5 times  Ok for lunch will never go back for breakfast  Huge disappointment Bad cold food 30 dollars for 2 people for bfast is crazy not to mention its cafeteria style so you get NO SERVICE for 30 bucksno thanks.
1827,1,Not much to say I absolutely love this Fry's The associates are always kind and professional They always remind you to use your Fry's card Produce is always fresh Prices compared to Albertson's are obvious savings.
3975,0,Never Again (at this location)Friday night was rough  On the way back from the bar I blew out a tire and changed it on the side of the road at 2 AM  By the time I got that taken care of and got everyone home it was nearly 3  I was spent and needed a little sustenance  Taco Bell is almost closed so where else to go  I channeled the old college student within and went to Whataburger  WhatamistakeCome to think of it I've had a couple sketchy experiences at this location (ie undercooked meat etc) but alcohol and/or exhaustion must have clouded my judgement  Being the ONLY customer in the drive thru getting a single burger should not have taken this long  I would say it may have taken longer since they were adding a slice of cheese they so graciously charged and additional 45 cents for but wait they neglected to put it on at allAfter taking one bite it all became clear  It took so long because they must have been shaking a salt shaker above it for at least 5 minutes  Gross   Never Again.
1703,1,"The team at Robert Wesley Jewelers that helped me marry my beautiful wife is first on my list I worked with Bobby (Jr) throughout my search for the perfect engagement ring and his dad was always available to give his stamp of approval when we made a decisionBobby had the patience of a saint considering 6 months passed from my first visit until we finally had the perfect diamond and setting We first had several loose diamonds flown in and Bobby educated me on their differences After a few visits we found a perfect diamond within my budget Then the real challenge began I was searching for a halo setting in yellow gold Bobby emailed me each designer that they carried and we started with dozens of options and narrowed it down over the next several weeks We found ""the"" setting at least 3 separate times until we finally brought in the female for a viewing While I tried on a Rolex or two they directed my now wife to the rings and were able to find the setting she really lovedWe had the perfect engagement ring and she of course said yes After the engagement we were all able to work together on the wedding band This was custom made so the diamonds went around the entire band but still matched the engagement ring perfectly I have since worked with Bobby for a custom engraved gold pendant for a Christmas gift and a set of diamond stud earrings for my wedding gift These guys are the best in the business for an engagement ring There are no high pressure sales tactics just a beautiful store with folks that truly have a passion for customer service This has been family owned since inception over 100 years under the same name I am grateful for the relationship I have at Robert Wesley Jewelers and for my happy wife."

867,0,SUPER RUDE - DON'T EVEN GOI have been going here for about 6 years now their pho and spring rolls and egg rolls are absolutely delicious one of the ladies here is super rude every time though Yes for the entire time I've been going here she has been an absolute b*tch she is a small thin chinese woman with a boy cut hair cut and is always very rude and mean again the food is great and everyone else is nice but I've just had it with dealing with her I made an order to go today and asked for fish sauce she put peanut sauce when I got there I asked for cups for chili sauce and she just shooed me off and told me it was all already in there when I got home all that was in there was a tiny thumbnail size of chili and they didn't even include a lime or lemon with my pho Again I'm just done with this place and will not be going back - don't waste your time either there are plenty of other pho places that will actually treat you with respect and courtesy for the same price and in the same area (one is over on 17th ave and camelback)Maxim you have lost a loyal long time customer and I will never recommend your restaurant to my friends ever again That woman is the rudest person I've ever came across in the food service industry  - I'm amazed if you don't lose more customers because of her.

1924,1,"I'm from Michigan and remember Mr Scribs being my favorite pizza there So when I heard it was now in Goodyear I was elated  There simply is no better pizza around in my opinion It's absolutely perfect  Maybe a bit pricey -- but I'll bite the bullet or hope for another coupon in the mail With the coupon I used I got 3 topping 16"" for about $10ish dollars Very reasonable with coupon Hoping they bring the cauliflour side to AZ  yum Anyway dont hesitate to try And wear your loose pants because you will eat way more than normal."
4624,0,This place was recommended to me so I decided to try it out BIG mistake I tried their Jampong soup and it was the WORST Jampong and worst soup I have ever had The noodles weren't freshinfact they tasted like they had been frozen for 5yrs too long Extremely mushy and not edible The soup was bland and was not proper Jampong soup I think they mixed a couple sauces together with water and called it Jampong The seafood and beef were dismal and the shrimp that was in the soup wasn't cleaned properly Please do us all a favor and take this so called Jampong soup off your menu.

4927,0,"I've spending a lot of time with a friend who is a pretty serious coffee drinker  A couple nights ago we stopped in at Hava Java for a caffeinated beverage before enjoying some gelato next door  Being the afternoon of July 4th the place was empty save for the barista and a guy who was in there chatting her up  I ordered a cafe au lait he an iced coffee of some sort  After asking me if I preferred skim milk or 2% the barista handed me my cup of milk and foam and told me the coffee was self-serve and pointed me in the direction of the three coffee dispensers on the other side of the bar  Really  $375 for a cafe au lait and I have to pour the coffee myself  I suppose that wouldn't have been entirely terrible if it had been any good  It's amazing how much difference whole milk makes but even beyond that the coffee was weak and flavorless and since it had to be pumped over the weak foam and milk my drink tasted like little more than a drip coffee with milk  Lame  Sorry Hava Java - a repeat customer I will not becomePS - A $025 ""service fee"" is charged to all credit/debit transactions  Again lame."
1890,1,Second large group experience hereOut with a party of 10 at 8pm Saturday night looking for dinner and drinks  After being told it would be a long wait at R&R we walked to Saddle Ranch  They said 30 minutes to get us a table for 10 but volunteered that since we had a wait they would set us up at the bar and the first round is on the house ()The wait was probably a little longer than 30 minutes but the bartender made great drinks food and prices were good and our server brought us a round of after-dinner shots again on the house  I was especially pleased because this is the second time I've come with a large group on the weekend and we were treated really well at Saddle Ranch - that is why I direct all my large groups here  Cheers to the manager for taking care of us and earning our loyaltyEDIT: If you're out on a weekend night looking for a good value for a drink the AMF is the house specialty  $13 for a carafe (guessing 32 ounces) of a coconut-flavored long islandIf you ride the bull as a guy the operator tries to throw you as quickly as possible  For girls however they go pretty easy on you.
1828,0,I'm surprised this place doesn't have more lower rated reviews We should have sat in the patio because couldn't see our menus or even our food indoors Seemed every table was using their flashlight iPhone app I complained on deaf ears Chicken was dry food presentation nice (if only we could see the food on the plates) but lacked much else Way overpriced for what you get (tiny servings) Best thing was the side of beans (amazing) Next time will try the place across the street.

3810,0,This restaurant is the BIGGEST JOKE  The portion sizes are extremely small and you will leave hungry After spending $20000 my husband and I had to go somewhere else to get something to eat A gentlemen in the restroom even commented to my husband that he didn't get much to eat and was still hungry Trust us go somewhere else Biggest disappointment of our dining experiences.
3359,0,Buyer Beware Do NOT buy from their bankruptcy liquidation sale - they are bringing in merchandise that R&S never carried to augment the sale We're talking wood veneers and fillers - we were scammed on our dining room set and are out several thousand dollars (the salesperson told us it was solid wood) You go there *thinking* you'll get a high end piece of furniture but they're using the R&S name to sell lesser quality items*Update* After contacting the company handling the liquidation and even getting an e-mail from the former owner of R&S we were refunded our full purchase price   I'm sticking with the original rating only because people visiting the bankruptcy sale need to know they're not getting the same quality they would expect from the R&S name.

3423,0,"Unfortunately my experience was much similar to Mark's The staff was indeed friendly but entirely unequipped to provide proper attention to a patient's individual needs My therapist Melissa was nice but after the initial assessment she failed to explain in any detail the source of my pain where it might have come from or illustrate a course of action Instead I was handed a sheet of exercises that looked like I could have printed it off of GoogleMelissa often had more than one patient scheduled during our appointments I would arrive and she would have me work on a machine while she saw to someone else On multiple occasions I would spend entire minutes sitting motionless waiting for Melissa to come back and instruct me This is ""treatment"" - time that I was billed for This did not seem to be the case with Melissa alone either At almost all times there were at least six patients for a total of two or three therapists One morning a woman even brought her labrador into the treatment room and it proceeded to bound around off-leash for her entire session I'm a dog lover as much as the next person but it's bad enough I have to share precious time with other members of the same species much less a dogUltimately I received no relief no specialized attention and no care I stopped treatment after three visits and would not recommend this clinic In addition as Mark said be sure to read the ""Welcome"" form - it will inform you what your insurance deductible is and how much has been met Under my plan previous chiropractic and physical therapy treatments had not been subject to a deductible but my benefits had recently changed I was shocked to get a bill in the mail for $570 That is an outrageous amount to pay for such poor care: patients need to be informed of what mediocre medical treatment will cost them I will add that after expressing my dissatisfaction to the Patient Services manager she was quick to respond and offer a resolution that I thought was fair As stated before the entire staff is courteous and patient but I would caution that it may be worth your time to seek treatment elsewhere."

431,1,Best taco shop in town hands downI love everything I have hadHorchatta is amazing I would say they need to get a bigger placea little cramped at timesI am on the fence about this because it makes things seem more communial and neighborhoody I tell people at La Condesa all the time The owner recently told me happy hour everyday 3-6pm$300 naturalorganic margaritas.
1056,1,Went for lunch  It's still within two months of opening and it's doing well from the size of the crowd  Parking is a bit of a challenge and you may have to park across the street (or in Amigo's Appliances lot as I didnot suggested)  The atmosphere is a nice change from most Pho places  It has a modern slightly contemporary feel to it with all the amenities of a social meeting locale (good bar few small TV's in the corners above the bar)  Walls are exposed brick and it has the now required community tableHad the Pho and it was outstanding  Tough to find good Pho generally in Phoenix but their's is impressive  Fun upbeat staffOnly hit was that it did take a little time to get the food but nothing too lengthyTry it out.
4935,0,The good: Nice ambiance friendly service I was trying to find a good ramen place (so spoiled by Orenchi in the bay area that's the golden standard) Walked in and saw some Asian people so thought it was a good sign The bad: Ordered chicken karage and ramen - chicken karage looked straight outta the freezer section at your local supermarket If you haven't had good chicken karage it's fried (chicken duh) with a batter similar to tempura (lighter than traditional American batters) Nope this was your standard frozen then warmed chicken with a rubbery-coating-that-passes-as-real-fried-food If I wanted frozen food I would have just made it myself (no I wouldn't that shit tastes terrible) The sauce was uninspiring but hey does it matter if the chicken isn't worth it The ugly:  The ramen I ordered came out and disappointment abounds First the noodles looked like what you buy at the supermarket So yeah if I want supermarket food I'll just go to the supermarket Am I wrong to expect restaurants to actually prepare food from scratch Oh but it's so hard to make noodles by hand/machine you say THAT'S WHY I SPEND MONEY IN A RESTAURANTWhat about the broth The life-sustaining broth that is cooked for hours if not days and ties the entire dish together  well let's not get too excited because once again it tastes more like powdered mix Are we sensing a theme here Lots of supermarket stuff at a premium price Sorry that's not why I go to a restaurantSo why did I even bother trying this place Because Yelp had promised me a grand culinary experience (okay maybe not grand but good at least) This was really sub-par at best the nicest servers or prettiest backdrop cannot make up for low-quality food But I am a temporary tourist in Phoenix (4 months for work normally in SF) so take my ran with a grain of salt Maybe all that big city living has made me a (ramen) snob YMMV.
1314,1,Great food at really reasonable prices very clean Mesquite fries are amazing  I don't think many people know about this place but they should  One of my favorite places to grab lunch  Love that the owner is usually there  Love even more that he recognizes me and strikes up conversation with me  The American Classic burger is the best burger I have found in the East Valley and for $6 you can't beat it.
4743,0,Stay as far away as you can This was my second visit and my last To have to prepay be acosted and over charged for a job done incorrectly is disturbing in the least A refund/replacement was out of the question for ruining my pants (hem that was not required making my pants too short) unless she got the pants back Who does that Nada is in no way interested in customer satisfaction or retention Beware.

2708,1,This place is awesome Better than the traditional fast Hawaiian foodThis place I'd say is very authentic with huge portions  It's inexpensive great quality/fresh and a huge portion  A must try if you are craving Hawaiian food.
644,1,If i have to choose between this location and the one on 43rd Ave It has to be this one  Why  Because here they get your drink out in literally 2min or less  Im not dogging the other location because they do great on the drinks but my God you can spend 20min in the drive-thru at times If you want fast friendly and awesome service this place kicks all kinds of ass :).
31,1,Yes I will admit that my family watches Triple D  Now with that said my wife and I have been to a few of the joints showcased on that show  As many of you that have started this journey like we have you find killer places and some okay places  Matt's is a KILLER placeMy wife and I were recently in the Phoenix area for a part of our vacation and planned to stop in for breakfast at Matt's the first morning  We got there ~8am on Saturday morning and only had to wait about 15 minutes  Yes the place was small but being the two of us it was not a challenge  There are about 9 tables total (assuming setup for 2) and 8 or so counter spotsThe food is awesome  It was so good we changed our plans and went back the next morning Here is what we had:Pork chop marinated with pesto and eggs with home fries side of bacon and toast with their very tasty home made jelly  The pork chop is to die for  I am a big pork chop for breakfast fan and usually very disappointed  Not at Matt's it was tender and cooked perfectly  My eggs were cooked exactly like I asked for and the bacon is like think slices of heaven  I had to have bacon both mornings and I am not a breakfast bacon fan usually  This bacon would make anything taste great  My wife had the daily special which was chicken sausage fresh spinach and fontina cheese scramble  Once again cooked perfect not greasy at all but with big flavor  We both had home fries which were incredible  Nice crust with some rosemary and caramelized onions  Pretty close to perfectThe next day my wife had the waffle which she liked  The fresh maple syrup was the real star of this dish  She was kind enough to pass the bacon to me (I know twist my arm)  I had the breakfast special which was a sirloin steak eggs and hash browns  The steak was SUPER tender and cooked EXACTLY how I asked (you can tell I do not experience that often)  It was obviously a good cut of meat and had been seasoned very nicely  The hash browns were very nice  Crust on both sides and tender in the middle  Exactly what you would hope for  Lastly was their toast and home made jelly  It was like butter  Nothing like your store bought jelly  I am not a jelly fan but ate all of it both morningsAs for the service it was pretty good  They were slammed on the first morning but were pleasant  The family atmosphere really made the hustle and bustle not so bad  The second time we went in they remembered us and took the time to talk for a few minutes and show their appreciation for us coming back so soon  Very nice touchOverall this now my favorite breakfast joint from Triple D  Whenever I travel to Phoenix I will plan to stop in  I would highly recommend it to anyone that wants breakfast cooked the way it should be.
176,1,After a long weekend at a kung fu seminar my sifu had and REALLY bad food a had in scottsdale I was thinking to myself AZ food sucks I don't live in AZ but I go there atleast once a year and when I leave I am disapointed and wishing I'm back in CA for real food One of my friends that live there challenged my complaint and brought me to Famous Dave's Barbeque You know i loves me some bbq but this is AZ how good can it be WoW This place is off the hook we ordered the dinner sampler which had chicken hot links BRISKET ribs and some sides They were all feakin OFF DA HOOK man Especially the brisket i think it was the best i ever had they offered 4-5 different kinds of bbq sauce I'm tellin ya i was in heaven PLS forgive me AZ for i have sinned you have opened my eyes and i will never say the food sucks there again THANK YOU SIR MAY I HAVE ANOTHER  :).

2382,1,This is by far the best sandwich place I've ever eaten at The bread is so soft and they give lots of meat I eat here three times a week I would definitely continue to come here Try the Club Grinder It's really good.
2081,1,I am a Gilbert boy and I have been eating here seemingly my whole life I take ALL of my out of town guests here especially when the weather is nice and we can sit outside Great vibe always super friendly staff and the best BBQ I have ever had hands down This food is made with love.
3023,1,At first most of my noobie friends are very skeptical about the fusion of Chicken and Waffles  but after taking them to this place and experiencing firsthand the divine taste of what they first believe was a anomalous combination it made them change their ReligionFor lunch time I suggest that you get to this place as early 11AM since this place has a very limited sitting you can expect up to 2 hour wait :(.
2025,1,Thanks to Yelpers we took the leap and had lunch here  I'd seen it before  bright shiny and  looking conspicuously like a former Five-and-Diner on Baseline  I'll admit the exterior was a bit off-putting but Yelpers inspired me to give it a shot and I'm glad we did  As mentioned in other reviews the lunch prices can't be beat  The hummus was fantastic - strong tahini and lemon flavors  The falafel most certainly is not from a mix (or if it is I'm betting it's in a language I can read nor speak)  The rice is uber simple but fantastic  I don't know why  Perhaps they ground up fairies  Fairy dust or no we'll definitely be back.
1051,1,My wife and I love this place  Great sushi and nice presentation  The patio outback is nice and romantic too.
3930,0,This place charges a cover charge We should be paid to come in there It's in a horrible place in town drinks or retardedly over priced & the parking is ridiculous The inside of the club only smells more worse then the urinal because the little tiny room they call a bathroom is 2x2 You can't pay me to come back there I wish I had known how horrible this place was before I got suckered into going & basically throwing away my money.
1024,1,Top notch all around I don't have a single complaint about this place The service was extraordinary the pizza comes out quick and is some of the best pizza I've ever tasted in this town The owner even came by our table after we had finished eating and poured us complimentary shots of his homemade limoncello You can tell from the second you walk in that the owner and his employees take great pride in their restaurant.

2381,1,"Before using Arizona Exterminating Co I used the cheap $35 service through Enterprise pest control All they did was spray for the $35 and nothing more I don't think one bug died A friend recommended Arizona Exterminating and the guy that came out came on time and asked me what the problem was He went inside and spread a can of stuff in I guess high traffic bug areas of the house then he went outside and got rid of all spider webs then spreaded a granule thing all over my yard Then he sprayed everywhere I signed up for a year contract with them and they now come every other month occasionally I see a bug inside and call the technician and he comes over the following day even if it is a month I am not supposed to have them comeI can't believe the customer service of this company and highly recommend them  I learned you go ""cheap"" on pest control and you don't get rid of anything."
4352,0,"We had absolutely terrible experiences with this company We called many times leaving messages because no one answers the phone -- EVER After an extended phone tag we finally reached them For example it took over 2 weeks to get a phone call from the owner They don't even ask your name they file everything by ""your cross streets"" I agree with the other reviewer - this fellow is in way over his head Anyway we finally had one scheduled and then the cleaner calls and wants to bring a 2-yr old child along for the three or four hours she would be in our home How unprofessional this outfit is - stay away."
2797,1,This place is AWESOME  I am personally not gay but have good friends who are and we always have a good time here  The drinks are cheap and strong and the bartenders/staff are always so welcoming and nice  If you wanna go dancing-this place has a great little area with awesome DJ's playing the best of the top 20's and moreI've been going here with my friends for the past 2 years or so and always have a great time.
4413,0,I won't be going here again for dinner The waitress hardly came over to check up on us I could understand if she had other tables to attend tobut she only had one other table besides ours It took us over 20 minutes for us to actually pay for our bill When my friend and I both asked for refills (we both had the same drink) she came back 5 minutes later with one refillthen asked if I wanted one too Well obviouslyI'm the one who asked in the first placeThe food was bland I have been here one other time and figured maybe it was just an off night Butthis time around the food was just as horrible We hardly ate our meals All togethernot a great experience I'll stick with Oregano's if I want Italian.
1810,0,I usually poke fun at Olive Garden as having bland food for people that have no idea what Italian food should really taste like yet I'd still choose them over Nick's I've read and respect the other reviews and perhaps we just caught a bad night but Nick's was awful We began with a service issue however that was minor and not worth repeating That problem would have been easily overlooked if the meal was good Instead we got uninspired bland food that seemed like it came right out of the jar or box The are too many quality choices in the area or not too far from he that are much better I would not go back to Nick's.
4381,0,Wow this store needs to re visit customer service 101 and T- mobile needs to drop them for representing themI have used T- mobile for over 10 years and have always had good service and been a happy user  I lost my earphones for my droid phone and stopped by this store (big sign is T-Mobile on store front)After waiting in line for awhile I was told the skull brand ($20) would work fine and I made sure that they would work on my phone and I could use them for the phoneLeft store thinking hmmm don't think I would ever want to go back there and tried the headset and low and behold they did not work  Was unable to hang up phone from the headset or answer phone from headset  Quick U-turn about a couple of miles down the road and back to this store to return and see if they had another choice  Waited in line again and then the same person (rep

1923,1,Great Mexican food with a friendly staff  Looks small from the outside but has plenty of room for dine in inside  Agree that the homemade tortillas are awesome  Brought some home for my family (as I am GF I couldn't try them but they reported they were awesome)  They have a great selection of food my favorite was machaca and eggsJust moved to AZ and live in East valley but am back here everytime I am in area (3xs so far in 2 months)  Highly recommend.
389,1,The Lox Eggs & Onions was delicious.
3886,0,I can't stand how this Walmart never has enough registers open and the employees all look at you like you are some major inconvenience to them The site-to-store: nightmare One register you have to call for help- they disappear to the back for no less than 10 mins- and one two occasions I've picked up my items and they were damaged Walmart is horrible After my experiences this Christmas season Never again I'm done Buy local and boycott Walmart.
4488,0,"As a 3-year patron of the Happy Valley Mellow Mushroom I never missed an opportunity to rave about the place  When this location opened just 5 minutes from my house I thought for sure it was a gift from God  However after 3 visits I will never be returning to this restaurant and will happily make the longer trek to Happy Valley where I know I will leave satisfiedOur first visit was 2 hours long  Not by our choosing  Not only did it take them over 30 minutes to get us our drinks (a water and a coke) but then an hour to get our meals  And my husband's meal was wrong they offered to make him the pizza he really ordered and we obliged  Had we known it would take them another hour to make the freakin thing we would have said no thanks  This was only a few weeks after they had opened so we thought that maybe it was because they were still getting their bearings and didn't realize how busy they would be (even though the place was empty)  So we gave them another shotThe next time we got take out pizza from them  It was cold but I suppose I can't blame them for that  This visit is not the reason I am writing this reviewThe last straw occurred last week on Wednesday October 10th  I had family in town my sister and 1 year old niece and we brought our 2 month old son to dinner as well  The 5 of us requested to sit outside because it was just plain gorgeous out  We arrived before 7pm  Upon going outside I immediately was hit with the smell of cigarettes so I tried to pick a table that seemed to be further away from the smell thinking it was just some passers by outside the restaurant  I unknowingly had chosen a table closer to a table where a few men were smoking  Now I was under the impression that smoking was no longer allowed in restaurantsI didn't think this was new news  My husband politely asked the server what their policy was on smoking and she said after 10pm they allowed it  (Which I still think is bull)  Since it was well before 10pm she asked the men to move  They stepped just outside the bar area and the lovely draft made the stench even worse but we couldn't complain since they weren't technically in the restaurant anymoreOur food arrived and it was good but our conversation kept getting interrupted by some loud people who turned out to actually be servers who kept going over to the smoking table and socializing with the men who were also servers  I discovered this because when the men left the table it was shortly reoccupied by two female servers on their breaks who promptly lit up as well  Not only is this illegal but with two babies nearby it is extremely inconsiderateWhen we left we were all very disappointed and embarrassed because we had raved so much about this place to my guest and it was such a terrible experience  My husband went in and asked for a manager unfortunately he didn't ask her name but he had the sneaking suspicion that she was not actually a manager but a server pretending to be a manager  He asked this person what their policy was on smoking and she said they allowed it ""on the ends but not in the middle""  What the heck kind of smoking policy is that and why were we told something different before  We will NEVER be going back to this location and I suggest that unless your favorite pizza condiment is second hand smoke you don't go here either."

4350,0,The place is a joke  It thinks it's about 5-6 miles south in old town but forgets that it shares a parking lot with Safeway and a bunch of other stores  This was the first time (and hopefully the last) I paid $10 cover and $10 a drink while parking next to a shopping cart returnThey make a feeble attempt to prop the lace up as a destination but once you're inside you tend to wonder why there's a dress code  Are they really that offended by toesThankfully there are several places nearby that are more fun- with no cover no less- so location saves it  You can have far more fun at Sand Bar Ernie's Tapino and Dirty Dogg.

1626,1,"FABULOUSWe were here for spring break last week and one of hubby's friends said we must eat at Houston's Glad he told us to go here (and he also told us about ""The Breakfast Club"" - another WIN) We got there pretty early on a weeknight - 6:15ish () - and there was already a LONG wait  Many retired folks go here I think so they probably start arriving at about 5 Note to self go earlier next time if with kids  We got the kids shirley temples and an appetizer and waited for maybe 30 minutes for our table  Got to do some fabulous people watching while we waited I could have SWORN they must have the ""HOUSEWIVES OF SCOTTSDALE"" there that night (if there were such a thing) We were standing right next to 3 of them I say jokingly  They were of course very nice and charming but I had to laugh to myself that they could film that show hereGot seated - and the food was fabulous I had the ahi tuna salad (was torn between that or the thai noodle salad but daughter voted for this one and I think I was going to share some with her is why I must have let her help me decide this time) Amazing Ate it all  Hubby got their hickory burger and chowed down Kids liked whatever they got too So glad we went here and waited to get a table when we were all famished after a long day of watching some major league baseball Worth the wait."
3124,0,I would never in my life eat here When I was there for their nighttime activities and people were throwing up I couldn't help but thinkwhy oh why would anyone want to eat here No offense but it was dirty and seemed like a sleazy place where younglings hang out to behave like they would in Mexico And how are girls supposed to get dressed up for a place that literally has a floor made of dirt This would be one of my last options if I wanted to go out Especially since I don't drink beer and that seems to be there most popular special I did go to the one in Chandler though and it was soooo much cleaner I liked that one much more.

4542,0,Went today Not very busy and still took about 15 mins to get 2 burgers and a shake The reason is because our burgers were done but they were doing TRAINING so our burgers sat there while the one server went through all of the procedure to adding pickles lettuce etc all the garnishments That alone took a good 5 mins Meanwhile our burger sat there getting cold Also the friesThen they called us up I alreayd knew it was going to be cold because we saw how long it had been sitting out with 2 employees hovering over itBurgers were cold fries were cold Had to send it all back UNREALI have been to Joes at LEAST 20x since its in our neighborhood and our last 5 experiences have been HORRIBLESo disappointing This place used to be great.
3225,0,"Honestly every single time I shop at this location I leave feeling belittled and bewildered I'm not a professional MUA but I make sure to do extensive research before purchasing any cosmetic item On several occasions I've gone into this Sephora with the intent of purchasing $50-$150 dollars worth of merchandise You'd think I'd have learned my lesson by now yet I continue to throw myself into the gauntlet of useless employees that wander aimlessly and reek of arrogance I HATE this Sephora By far the worst one I've EVER been to It's a shame I live on the west side of town because the Scottsdale location is far superiorTime and time again I leave this location feeling as though I've been looked down upon and written off Or better yet I get ""information"" about products I'm not the least bit interested inUnfortunately I'll be taking my business elsewhere in the futureOh and I believe the woman who ""assisted"" me last week was named Megan Here's a tip for you: Change your foundation I'm surely not buying a product if you're wearing it and I can see every pore wrinkle and hair on your face."
4172,0,I was so grossed out eating here The entire place was dirty They're doing some remodeling but no excuse The drink area was gross most of the tables were dirty the cashier obviously hates her job I very rarely write a bad review but I wanted someone else to be warned before they come to this restaurant They need someone from corporate to come evaluate it and clean it up Even the bathroom was worse than a ghetto gas station I will not be returning to this location.
1287,1,"Carlos is the man  He's worked here for seventeen years and he will make sure you have a good experience  5 and Diner is a great choice for families  The fifties themed decor is fun for all  On my most recent visit I had to try to explain the concept of a hula hoop to a three year old  Since a demonstration was out of the question I'm afraid this little one will have to wait for later clarification  She did enjoy coloring the paper hat the restaurant provided however and her folks enjoyed the $275 price tag on the generous junior pancake breakfast  The menu also features a separate section for seniors  While technically you have to be fifty-five to order from this section of the menu in my experience servers will allow anyone who would prefer these smaller portions and prices to order them  A note about prices  While the kids menu prices are very reasonable select off menu junior beverages are a bit pricey (juice $179) and can drive up your total cost  There is also a loyalty card that will help stretch the dollar of frequent dinersThe Southwest Omelet was perfect on our recent visit and definitely worth a taste  The pancakes were uniform and served hot In all honesty however it's the decor and the friendly staff that earns the restaurant five stars in this review Menu offerings are solid with a few amusing names scattered throughout but are for the most part predictable and basic  But come to think about it isn't that what you want from a fifties dinerEven though 5 and Diner is not a ""genuine"" fifties diner instead an Arizona based chain's recreation of the era it seems genuine enough  I've noticed that several locations have closed in recent years but the PV location seems to be unaffected and thriving."

14,1,My boyfriend and I decided to take his son out for gelato yesterday and after seeing the reviews on this place we decided to try it I purchased the fantastic deal available and off we went Once we arrived the person we dealt with was super personable and very helpful she let us try all the flavors we wanted to make sure we would get the one we liked After trying the African Dark Chocolate I knew I'd found my new love It was absolutely delicious My boyfriend and his son are also huge fans We will definitely be back If you haven't checked this place out yet you should definitely fix that :).

4679,0,Server was rude and unfriendly Place wasn't very clean either Don't go expecting them to be accommodating at all if you request their items to be made differently than as stated on menu Very disappointed.
2836,0,"This was the most disgusting experience I have ever had at a restaurant I normally do not write reviews but felt I needed to share this My husband and I along with our 2 year old went there for breakfast on a Saturday morning I ordered the eggs benedict ""Joynt Style"" which seemed to be their speciality I also had hot chocolate and ordered a glass of milk We ordered the kids pancake with bacon for my daughter and a ham and cheese omlette for my husband My hot chocolate was average but what came next was appauling The milk they brought me was totally spoiled The eggs in my eggs benedict were over cooked so the yokes we totally hard the sauce was disgusting and my hashbrowns tasted like sausage My daughters pancake was hard as a rock and my husband's omlette was overcooked as well The waiter apologized and offered me another glass of milk I declined And he noticed that all 3 of us had full plates when we asked for the check He did comp my eggs benedict But I will definately NOT be back Hopefully this was just a one off situation but somehow I doubt it If I could give 0 stars I would."
2532,1,I love this edifice so much I want to marry it But since marrying buildings has not been approved by the voters of Arizona along with same sex marriage and the marrying of goats I shall perhaps just have to have a party here WOW What a venue The ECHO magazine awards were held here and they couldn't have picked a better space The textures shapes and colors are stimulating and soothing Much like that chilled double shot of Patron they served me Great sight lines audio and comfy seats all added up to a win win situation Oh And the fact that we won that night was even better The views of Tempe Lake and the infinity pool were amazing From the outside I have to admit it looked a bit like a Evangelical church But once inside full of drag queens and Grey Goose schwilling mos I knew this was not that kind of church In fact no church at all Tempe Center for the Arts is its own art Sexy Chic And urban I think that party I'll have will be a yelp event and y'all are invited.
4042,0,Haven't eaten yet but ordered a mojito from the bar and it was really bad Too much simple syrup and only 2 small bar-slices of lime I had to pour in a whole tall glass of soda water to make it drinkable When the hostess brought us to the table it was obvious that it hadn't been wiped down We just ordered May have an update laterOK just finished the meal Mongolian Beef was good my chicken dish was also too sweet and the vegetables were so over-cooked that they were mush Rice was hard on top like it had been put in the single serving bowl over an hour prior to being brought to our table Garlic-chile noodles were just OK Not a single piece of fresh garlic or red chile flakes even though we asked for extra spicy And even that dish was slightly sweet   What is with all the sugary sweet sauces in this place  Check for 2 with 2 cocktails and tip was around $75  I could have had 2-3 great meals at my regular place for Chinese (see my other reviews) - oh well lesson learned.
1389,0,After leaving a previous poor review I was consistently contacted by upper management trying to redeem themselves This restaurant is not near my home but I agreed to try them again and was promised they would send a certificate for dinner on them at our convenience  However it has been over a month now and I have yet to see anything I am still VERY unsatisfied with this company.

3879,0,"I must preface this by admitting that I haven't stayed in a Motel 6 in quite some time but I always remembered them as being just OK- small a little dingy probably noisy but a cheap place to get some rest  My recent experience here was quite different  Firstly despite reserving a ""non-smoking"" room I arrived in the evening to find that none existed  My room smelled like a freshly used ashtray and my throat started getting scratchy right away  I went out for dinner and a cocktail and returned to find a security guard wanting to walk me to my room  Instead however of ""have a good night"" or something similar he told me that I had better not make any noise or I'd be kicked out  OK  I went quietly inside and started looking for the remote control for the TV  None  Pay extra for wi-fi  I was considering it but what is that new choking smell  SMOKE  Something is on fire  I opened the door to find smoke pouring out of the neighboring room  With a toddler staring out from behind him my neighbor tried to assure me that the smoke was just his bandanna that had accidentally caught fire and everything was under control  Pay no attention to this crack pipe or the acrid smoke that I'm exhaling nowNow my throat is really getting sore  It's 3 am and I'm scared that if I fall asleep the place could burn down  Where's that security guy now Feeling really dirty I looked at the bathtub and shower  Burn marks all over it  Burn holes in the bedding too nicesmall bar of soap but no shampoo  1 extremely threadbare tiny towel  Not inviting whatsoeverI had a reservation for a second night but instead slept for an hour or so in my truck in the parking lot and then found a different place to stay/bathe  Cursing the guy who recommended this placeI'm hoping the smell comes out of my clothes now."
1264,1,One of the best places to get real home cooked deli food Meatballs Roast Beef Chicken Salad Baked Beans And a host of other delicious food All home cooked prepared and served by the wonderful and friendly Casella family.
4528,0,This place looked great and has good reviews but I was not impressed with the final product  My sister and I used the groupon and we were excited to have some pampering time  We both got pedicures and they were so sloppy  I give myself a better pedicure than what I received at this place  Even after them cleaning up their mess there still was polish on my toes outside of the nail  Not to mention that the polish chipped in less than a week which is something that never happens when I do my own pedicure They seemed like nice people but overall I was extremely disappointed with the final product and will not recommend this place.
2136,1,most authentic japanese i've had made by real japanese people  (if u don't know most sushi restaurants and japanese restaurants are actually owned by koreans lols)  the guy is an old-skool asian guy not grumpy but not nice  he does what he does  atmosphere needs some music but food makes up 4 it  if u order a dinner u get a yakitori skewer and OMFG it makes the meal  lightly crunchy outside juicy flavorful chicken on the inside srslythe only thing i don't like is how sweet some of the japanese sauces are but that's my own personal preference.
3749,0,First things first they are not Greek Ok I too have given this place more than one chance First visit was ok Met the owner and was excited they were there I work in the area Second visit I encouraged other employees to try the food I called and asked if we could give them our order the day before so it would be ready before lunch crowd No One of the rude girls there said no you have to call the day of the pick up So we called in our orders all nine of them as soon as they opened When we got there we had to stand in line with people who were placing orders02 of them Ok our food sat there for over 30 minutes that we knew ofFriday evening at 7:55 I called and asked what time they closed and one of those girls told me 9:00pm  I drove 12 miles back to the area When I arrived at 8:45 pm I assume the same girl I had spoken with earlier said we decided to close early tonight Thats enough for me  The owner needs to send his girls to charm school and they need to know customers aren't coming in because of them.
437,1,"Went to lunch here today Had the chicago dog with fries and a few bites of the steakburger (Not that I wouldnt have eaten more)The fries are awesome here I love the thin shoestring fries The dog was good it was on a great bun No complaints at allI had a few bites of the steakburger from my girlfriend She wouldnt let me eat it all HAHASo I was done eating and was like oh what the hell lets get the custard I tried the brownie delight= Delicious Very smooth and probably the best frozen ""ice cream"" I've ever tried I will be back and will make a special trip to try more stuff."
1632,1,i love this placeafter viewing films here don't know how i'll be able to return to regular theatersthe premium seats (automated recliners) are super comfortable the food and beverage service is quick and easyyou get free popcorn and a blanket and pillow too.
4441,0,Not a very good take out experience   We ordered a salad and 3 pasta dishes  Salad was fine but all 3 pasta dishes disappointedPenne San remo was dry   Spaghetti with meat sauce seemingly skipped most of the meat sauce and the Quattro al forno was a tiny portion for $21Would not suggest take out from buca   The price/value relationship is way off.
1031,1,The food here is very fresh and well balanced  I have been here twice (proximity to the office) and I am happy they are so close  I will conitnue to come back here with my wife for dinner to explore teh wine list  Service was very attentive and I even got to meet the owners they seem very excited to have such a great spot with such good food  For those in the area you will not believe that this used to be Darwins a dingy sports bar  If that is what you remember come out to see Nook and be impressed.
4355,0,Save yourself and try somewhere else The taco and relleno plate was just horrible A mush of egg and bad cheese Taco was dripping oil  My sister's huevos rancheros weren't much better  Bland tomato sauce  There is better food out there.
578,1,The food here is ridiculously good  Every single item was amazingWe went here on a Sunday after a visit to a downtown church and apparently we are the only people who immediately felt after prayer that what we need on a mid-day on Sunday are some cocktails and some amazing food  No one was there at all  Well the owners were there :)Nobou has a smaller menu at lunch and we ended up ordering three entrees even though we were full with two because we just had to try more - it was just so goodThey used their own homegrown purple basil in several of the drinks and dishes and because I raved about it so much they cut me some and sent me home with a big bunch of basil  How nice is thatI wondered how a place could have such a high rating with 103 reviews - really that many people loved it  Yep  Now I see why  Wish I was downtown more  Also wish more places had non-brunch Sunday food  Cause I like myself a cocktail and a nice lunch on Sundays :).
2593,1,Enjoying a great French country lunch.
664,1,South Mountain Park is awesome Great hiking and mountain bike trails I've hiked just about every marked trail and many that aren'tHidden Valley (Fat Man's Pass) is probably the most interesting as a nice diversion off the National Trail In the winter I hike quite a bit in the western part of the park and rarely see people which can be nice if you are looking for quietTelegraph Pass is a favorite from the south while the Central Avenue or 24th street locations are most popular from the North The busiest parking lot and a great place to people watch as well is the entrance from 48th street to the east.
968,1,"Costco now sells really good Honey Baked Hams  and if you have never had a REAL HONEY BAKED HAM as in FROM HONEYBAKED HAM Co on Cactus Rd then you can't die just yet  You must at least once in your life have one from here  I only buy them around holidays like Christmas and I have to wait in a big ass long line just to pick the ham up  You must  pre-order your ham in advance to guarantee you get one for Christmas  So as I stand in the line I tell myself that it would be so much better if I just decided to buy a ham in September sometime or in July-- but I forgetNot that waiting in the line is so bad they have lots of free samples of food and there are usually nice people around you to make conversation with- ever so often an angry husband who must not have  know what he was getting himself into when he said ""sure- I'll run and pick up the ham honey""So this ham it is this perfect crunchy outer sugary glaze that just makes my mouth water thinking about it  You need to go to Honeybaked Ham Like FOR REAL."
1326,1,My original review seems to have disappearedAnywho love these guys I was introduced to their deliciousness at Yelps pleYdate A few months later I contacted them about cupcakes for my husbands birthday Lana was so awesome She tweeked one of her delicious recipes specifically for us Our fave shot is an Irish Apple (Irish whisky instead of Crown Royal) so she turned her Washington Apple cupcakes into Irish Apples and they were soooooo delicious We also got the Irish Car Bombs so good Lana even worked w/ me on a time and place to pick them up My husband was super surprised and thought they were absolutely great SuccessAffordable prices delicious product and awesome people Could you ask for anything more.
4747,0,Its suitable when you are dying for quick cheap pizza I have lived within a block of them ever since they opened I have eaten there three times in like 8 years I try them again about once every two years to see if they have improved Here is the problem: it just doesn't taste that good Owner and employees are nice but the product is average They need to use better cheese and tastier sauce The crust is also average way too chewy/doughy It's funny because if they just fixed their pizza they could really have a good thing - it's totally tucked away in this little corner by the fountain outdoor seating is avail in this tiny little strip mall with like zero competition for a two mile radius - local neighborhood people like me would totally get behind them but the pizza is just not that good sorry.
227,1,Alexi's is somewhere between Greek and Italian closer to the latter No matter - each entree is outstanding in its own right Last time in the desert cannelloni was spicy and delicious - and totally hopped up on chile peppers The salmon salad - magnificent - and perfectly cooked The food is excellent AND it's a great place to hob-nob The area has a loyal clientele of movers and shakers Alexi's is highly recommended in midtown - one of the best places especially for lunch in Phoenix.
495,0,Surprisingly the worst mexican food I've ever had Even other Macayo's are light years better Want some dry rice hot/bland spices and food that tastes like cardboard This is your placeMore like a bar than a restaurant.
2279,1,"This is one of my favorite little gems in Phoenix I've never had better pho than here I usually order the ""spicy beef sate"" pho which is miles above the rare beef pho My family and I also order the pork ""spicy treats"" which is a roll-your-own spring roll It's delicious and fun One order feeds all five of us The owner is also extremely nice They also offer discounts to ASU students Have to love that."
2195,1,"I stopped in with a friend on a Saturday night after a friend had recommended it to me and was totally thrilled we did We sat at a table for sushi and waited no longer than 10 minutes for a table - amazing for 8 pm on a Saturday in old towneUnfortunately they had sold out of the oysters but the other dishes we'd ordered were fabulous - starting with a seared tuna dish then softshell crab roll rainbow roll and the green mussels The seared tuna was cooked and cut perfectly - just the right temperature with a peppery ""rub"" the rolls were a decent size with thick cuts of fish and plenty of flavorful crab and the mussels were a tad overcooked for my preference but the creamy texture and buttery flavor still made it a winner The thing I appreciated most was actually the service - we weren't rushed or hassled and the food came out a dish at a time giving us a chance to eat and enjoy before getting our next dish At other sushi joints I am constantly feeling rushed while trying to fit all of the dishes on the table (and I'm not what you'd call a slow eater) This was a happy medium for me The server confirmed that we were ready for the bill instead of just dropping it off without asking - it's the little details that make a big difference to meMy only other con was creepy old men leering at us from the barbut that's what you get in Scottsdale."
985,1,I have never loved tacos This place changed my mind The quality and size of their tacos surpasses that of America's (Sorry America's Taco Shop lovers) and it adds a strong local cultural vice that other taco shops lack with its Dia de los Muertos themed paintings The meat is well-marinated (especially the carne asada) and the dozen-plus salsas are each different by tasty and made to perfection You can spend ten-to-fifteen minutes just sorting through the salsa bar I am lucky enough to live nearby and I take advantage of the shark tacos on most days :) I am so glad that it's caught on I know that I will keep coming back.
3471,0,And the Herb Box does it again I knew not to go back after the terrible service but my girlfriend said she really wanted to try it  So what happens I check my bank statement and they charged me twice  Once for my meal and an additional charge for 137 bucks  I'll change this review if they handle it well but I'm not holding my breath.
3832,0,This place is right if you like getting your face kicked in or being raped in the parking lot with a screw driver check it out.

1881,1,I have used McFarlands for quite sometime now and I have always been impressed They do a great job on rug cleanings and repairs I have taken dozens of rugs to them over the years and always  pleased with the quality of work They are pretty affordable too Would recommend to anyone.
241,1,"Being a San Francisco native I fell in love with this place for many reasons  First the owner is from SFsuper nice guy who takes the time to get to know you  You feel like a ""regular"" right off the bat  Second the ambiance is fresh trendy and very clean  Third the food is AMAZING  You can't go wrong with anything you order  This is one restaurant that each time we go we try different things and we are never disappointed  Two of my favorites are the Grilled Halibut and Panang Curry  The Spring Rolls are a perfect light start to the meal  The flavors are aromatic fresh and perfectly cooked  I've notice some other reviews mention the portion sizes  I agree their apps and entrees are on the ""smaller"" side but this is comparable to some restaurants who serve you way too much food  I truly feel they serve healthy portion sizes  We've never walked away hungry (and my husband could be a champion eater)  I guess the only caveat is we never have a to-go box of the delicious food to take home  )Also if you like wine the owner has other bottles that aren't on his list and he prices them welljust need to askLatitude Eight is a gem in Downtown Chandler."
4637,0,"Wife and i were returning from a family photo shoot and decided to stop for a little dinner Originally planned to stop at Macayos but the Litchfield location was crowded so we figured we'd try Raul and Theresas They have a good reputation from their Avondale store so how could it not be good Oh in so many ways Service was okay ambience was dreadful portions were small Had the cheese enchilada and chili relleno plate it was scrambled egg on an uncooked green chili with some kind of cheese that was unidentifiable since it had no flavor Enchilada had same cheese and was less than lackluster Wife had taco and enchilada plate and the taco shells were so tender they crumbled all over the plate As we left the only comment I could think to make was 'well we tried it"" Guess if we want real authentic mexican food we'll have to travel over to Garcias Las Avenidas."
803,1,This place is outstanding Burgers are fantastic huge boutique soda selection soft serve ice cream with owners that are friendly and happy to provide great service and food I will be back as often as I can.
4810,0,Slow service staff needs more training There's like 4 managers and none of the know what they are doing i don't think this place is going to make it Sorry but you lost 4 very good patrons Saturday night because of your poor customer service.
403,1,Love this placevery intimate atmosphere.
2455,1,Doc and Edwards has been a place of refuge for 5 years for me  Hell most of my friends spent their 21st birthday there  It is hard to explain walking into a bar and just feeling at home  It is so comfortable and wide open  Even on the most crowded days I feel like I am on the cast of cheers  The employees there are good and the food is exactly what you expect  You can also order silvermine there with no delivery charge  The pool table rates have gone up in the last few years but if you spend a good amount of money on drinks they waive the pool table fee Or you could go for some ping pong foosball UFC or big buck hunting  It has a great juke box but watch out for the lady that throws 20 in and slangs the worst playlist I have ever heard If my girl would only let me I would have my wedding there.
1880,1,"i can't believe how age and wear and tear grind on the body i use to be able to do this i thought much better i had an online coupon so i took my wife for some indoor rock climbing she had never been and is terrified of heights so i thought why notthe staff was friendly and casual and after a brief orientation video we were given a more hands on orientation by another staff member although i ""knew the ropes""hahahahamy wife did not and since she would be my belayer i wanted her to know what she was doing the hands on orientation is very fast my wife started to glaze over as soon as she heard ""carabiner"" but she was able to attend and after several climbs i was without broken bones the gym is huge and full of difficult and not-so-difficult climbs we never had to wait for a rope there are storage areas for your stuff but no lockers they rent shoes chalk bags harnesses everything and if i'm not mistaken teach classes as well always fun for me and i hope my wife still loves me after making her climb a wall with rocks bolted in it with nothing but me holding on to her."
